            "summary": "\"What we often attribute to bond vigilantes may actually be markets amplifying decisions already made by central banks,\" economic historian Adam Tooze argues. The debate over bond vigilantes and market confidence fairies doesn't sound very serious, but it reflects a deep divide in economics: Keynesians argue government spending can effectively boost growth during downturns, while their opponents (often called \"neoliberals\" or \"market monetarists\") argue that calming financial markets through spending restraint and a hardline against inflation is more important for economic stability."
