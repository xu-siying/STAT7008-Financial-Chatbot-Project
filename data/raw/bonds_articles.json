FG Trade Latin / GettyImages Investors have several ways to buy treasuries. These investments include Treasury bills, Treasury notes, Treasury bonds, Floating Rate Notes (FRNs), and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). Individuals with brokerage accounts can invest using exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Treasury money market funds, or purchase bonds on the secondary market. The U.S. government offers investors direct access to treasuries at the TreasuryDirect website. TreasuryDirect is an electronic marketplace and online account system where investors can buy, hold, and redeem eligible book-entry Treasury securities. The U.S. Department of the Treasury runs the TreasuryDirect system. Investors with TreasuryDirect accounts can participate in Treasury debt auctions and purchase debt securities including U.S. savings bonds directly from the U.S. Treasury. Eligible securities for TreasuryDirect purchases include Treasury bills, Treasury notes, Treasury bonds, Floating Rate Notes (FRNs), and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). Individuals who choose to purchase directly through the TreasuryDirect website should be aware of the following steps and rules when opening an account: Investors can't redeem Treasuries purchased on TreasuryDirect before maturity. To sell them, individuals must transfer securities to a broker and then sell them on the secondary market through that broker. TreasuryDirect account holders can participate in Treasury auctions. In 2023, there were 428 public auctions for $22 trillion in Treasury debt securities. The Treasury Department will announce the date, the amount of a security to be auctioned, its issue and maturity dates, terms and conditions, eligible participants, and deadlines for competitive and noncompetitive bids. Noncompetitive bids are limited to $10 million and guarantee the bidder will receive the desired amount of the auctioned security at a price set by competitive bidders in the auction. Competitive bids specify the expected\u00a0discount rate, yield, or spread and may only be filled in part, or not at all. Most individual investors make noncompetitive bids, while competitive bids typically come from financial institutions. On the auction date, the Treasury reviews all bids for compliance with applicable rules. Compliant noncompetitive bids must be received by the close time stated in the auction announcement. Securities are deposited to investor accounts, and payment is delivered to the Treasury. If investors seek guidance from a financial advisor to buy Treasuries for their retirement account, the advisor is subject to the Retirement Security Rule, which makes them a fiduciary and requires that they act in the best interest of their clients. The rule, which was set to take effect in September 2024, is currently on hold due to litigation. To sell Treasuries held in an account at TreasuryDirect, investors must transfer them to an account with a bank, broker, or dealer, and then place an order to sell them. A Transfer Request Form must be completed to transfer Treasuries from a TreasuryDirect account. Individuals can also redeem a savings bond electronically, specifying whether it is a partial or full redemption, and where redemption proceeds should be deposited.

Read our\u00a0advertiser disclosure\u00a0for more info. Investors buy short-term Treasury bills on TreasuryDirect, the U.S. government's portal for buying U.S. Treasuries. Short-term Treasury bills can be bought and sold through a bank or broker. The maximum amount of Treasury bills that one can buy in a single auction is $10 million if the bids are noncompetitive, or 35% of the offering amount for competitive bids. Individuals can buy Canadian Treasury bills from a financial institution or a broker. The minimum investment for purchasing a Canadian Treasury bill is CA$1,000. Treasuries are a great way to diversify an investment portfolio and reduce risk. These securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Treasuries can be important in a retirement portfolio because they are liquid, low-risk, and provide an income stream.

            "title": "Understanding Interest Rates, Inflation, and Bonds",
            "content": "Owning\u00a0a bond is essentially\u00a0like possessing\u00a0a stream of future cash payments. Those cash payments are usually made in the form of periodic interest payments\u00a0and the return of principal when the bond matures. In the absence of credit risk (the risk of default), the value of that stream of future cash payments is a function of your required return based on your inflation expectations. This article breaks down bond pricing, defines the term \"bond yield,\" and demonstrates how inflation expectations and interest rates determine the value of a bond. There are two primary risks that must be assessed when investing in bonds: interest rate risk and credit risk. Though our focus is on how interest rates affect bond pricing (otherwise known as interest rate risk), a bond investor must also be aware of credit risk. At the July 2023 FOMC meeting, the Fed announced it was raising the federal funds rate by 0.25%, moving its target range to 5.25%-5.50%. The Fed expects to continue raising rates in order to bring down inflation. As a result, the 10-year Treasury is hovering roughly around 4%. Interest rate risk is the risk of changes in a bond's price due to changes in prevailing interest rates. Changes in short-term versus long-term interest rates can affect various bonds in different ways, which we'll discuss below. Credit risk, meanwhile, is the risk that the issuer of a bond will not make scheduled interest or principal payments. The probability of a negative credit event or default affects a bond's price \u2013\u00a0the higher the risk of a negative credit event occurring, the higher the interest rate investors will demand in exchange for assuming that risk. Bonds issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to fund the operation of the U.S. government are known as U.S. Treasury bonds. Depending on the time until maturity, they are called bills, notes, or bonds. Investors consider U.S. Treasury bonds to be free of default risk. In other words, investors believe that there is no chance that the U.S government will default on interest and principal payments on the bonds it issues. For the remainder of this article, we will use U.S. Treasury bonds in our examples, thereby eliminating credit risk from the discussion. To understand how interest rates affect a bond's price, you must understand the concept of yield. While there are several different types of yield calculations, for the purposes of this article, we will use the yield to maturity (YTM) calculation. A bond's YTM is simply the discount rate that can be used to make the present value of all of a bond's cash flows equal to its price. In other words, a bond's price is the sum of the present value of each cash flow, wherein the present value of each cash flow is calculated using the same discount factor. This discount factor is the yield. When a bond's yield rises, by definition, its price falls, and when a bond's yield falls, by definition, its price increases. The maturity or term of a bond largely affects its yield. To understand this statement, you must understand what is known as the yield curve. The yield curve represents the YTM of a class of bonds (in this case, U.S. Treasury bonds). In most interest rate environments, the longer the term to maturity, the higher the yield will be. This makes intuitive sense because the longer the period of time before cash flow is received, the greater the chance is that the required discount rate (or yield) will move higher. Inflation is a bond's worst enemy. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of a bond's future cash flows. Typically, bonds are fixed-rate investments. If inflation is increasing (or rising prices), the return on a bond is reduced in real terms, meaning adjusted for inflation. For example, if a bond pays a 4% yield and inflation is 3%, the bond's real rate of return is 1%. In other words, the higher the current rate of inflation and the higher the (expected) future rates of inflation, the higher the yields will rise across the yield curve, as investors will demand a higher yield to compensate for inflation risk. Note that\u00a0Treasury inflation-protected securities\u00a0(TIPS) can be an effective way to offset inflation risk while providing a\u00a0real rate of return\u00a0guaranteed by the U.S. government. As a result, TIPS can be used to help battle inflation within an investment portfolio. Inflation and expectations of future inflation are a function of the dynamics between short-term and long-term interest rates. Worldwide, short-term interest rates are administered by nations' central banks. In the United States, the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets the federal funds rate. Historically, other dollar-denominated short-term interest rates, such as LIBOR or LIBID, have been highly correlated with the fed funds rate. The FOMC administers the fed funds rate to fulfill its dual mandate of promoting economic growth while maintaining price stability. This is not an easy task for the FOMC; there is always debate about the appropriate fed funds level, and the market forms its own opinions on how well the FOMC is doing. Central banks do not control long-term interest rates. Market forces (supply and demand) determine equilibrium pricing for long-term bonds, which set long-term interest rates. If the bond market believes that the FOMC has set the fed funds rate too low, expectations of future inflation increase, which means long-term interest rates increase relative to short-term interest rates \u2013\u00a0the yield curve steepens. If the market believes that the FOMC has set the fed funds rate too high, the opposite happens, and long-term interest rates decrease relative to short-term interest rates \u2013\u00a0the yield curve flattens. The timing of a bond's cash flows is important. This includes the bond's term to maturity. If market participants believe that there is higher inflation on the horizon, interest rates and bond yields will rise (and prices will decrease) to compensate for the loss of the purchasing power of future cash flows. Bonds with the longest cash flows will see their yields rise and prices fall the most. This should be intuitive if you think about a present value calculation \u2013\u00a0when you change the discount rate used on a stream of future cash flows, the longer until cash flow is received, the more its present value is affected. The bond market has a measure of price change relative to interest rate changes; this important bond metric is known as duration. Nominal interest rates are the stated rates, while real rates adjust for inflation. Real rates provide a more accurate picture of borrowing costs and investment returns by accounting for the erosion of purchasing power. Bond prices and interest rates have an inverse relationship. When interest rates rise, newly issued bonds offer higher yields, making existing lower-yielding bonds less attractive, which decreases their prices. The yield curve illustrates the relationship between bond yields and their maturities. A normal curve slopes upward, indicating higher yields for longer maturities. Inverted or flat curves can signal economic uncertainty or impending recession. This curve helps shape communicate future expectations about global economies. Investors can diversify their portfolios to include assets like stocks, commodities, and inflation-protected securities to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes and inflation on their investments. If you're specifically interested in hedging your investment portfolio against high or increasing interest rates, consider discussing this investment decision with your financial advisor. Interest rates, bond yields (prices), and inflation expectations correlate\u00a0with one another. Movements in short-term interest rates, as dictated by a nation's central bank, will affect different bonds with different terms to maturity differently, depending on the market's expectations of future levels of inflation. The key to understanding how a change in interest rates will affect a certain bond's price and yield is to recognize where on the yield curve that bond lies (the short end or the long end) and to understand the dynamics between short- and long-term interest rates. With this knowledge, you can use different measures of duration and convexity to become a seasoned bond market investor.

            "title": "Why Companies Issue Bonds",
            "content": "Issuing bonds is one way for companies to raise money. A bond functions as a loan between an investor and a corporation. The investor agrees to give the corporation a certain amount of money for a specific period of time. In exchange, the investor receives periodic interest payments. When the bond reaches its maturity date, the company repays the investor. The decision to issue bonds instead of selecting other methods of raising money can be driven by many factors. Comparing the features and benefits of bonds versus other common methods of raising cash provides some insight. It helps to explain why companies often issue bonds when they need to finance corporate activities. Borrowing from a bank is perhaps the approach that comes to mind first for many people who need money. That leads to the question, \"Why would a corporation issue bonds instead of just borrowing from a bank?\" Like people, companies can borrow from banks, but issuing bonds is often a more attractive proposition. The interest rate that companies pay bond investors is usually less than the interest rate available from banks. Companies are in business to generate corporate profits, so minimizing the interest is an important consideration. That is one of the reasons why healthy companies that don\u2019t seem to need the money often issue bonds. The ability to borrow large sums at low interest rates gives corporations the ability to invest in growth and other projects. Issuing bonds also gives companies significantly greater freedom to operate as they see fit. Bonds release firms from the restrictions that are often attached to bank loans. For example, banks often make companies agree not to issue more debt or make corporate acquisitions until their loans are repaid in full. Such restrictions can hamper a company\u2019s ability to do business and limit its operational options. Issuing bonds enables companies to raise money with no such strings attached. Issuing shares of stock grants proportional ownership in the firm to investors in exchange for money. That is another popular way for corporations to raise money. From a corporate perspective, perhaps the most attractive feature of stock issuance is that the money does not need to be repaid. There are, however, downsides to issuing new shares that may make bonds the more attractive proposition. Companies that need to raise money can continue to issue new bonds as long as they can find willing investors. The issuance of new bonds does not affect ownership of the company or how the company operates. Stock issuance, on the other hand, puts additional stock shares in circulation. That means future earnings must be shared among a larger pool of investors. More shares can cause a decrease in earnings per share (EPS), putting less money in owners' pockets. EPS is also one of the metrics that investors look at when evaluating a firm\u2019s health. A declining EPS number is generally viewed as an unfavorable development. Issuing more shares also means that ownership is now spread across a larger number of investors. That often reduces the value of each owner's shares. Since investors buy stocks to make money, diluting the value of their investments is highly undesirable. By issuing bonds, companies can avoid this outcome. Bond issuance enables corporations to attract a large number of lenders in an efficient manner. Record keeping is simple because all bondholders get the same deal. For any given bond, they all have the same interest rate and maturity date. Companies also benefit from flexibility in the significant variety of bonds that they can offer. A quick look at some of the variations highlights this flexibility. The basic features of a bond\u2014credit quality and duration\u2014are the principal determinants of a bond's interest rate. In the bond duration department, companies that need short-term funding can issue bonds that mature in a short time period. Companies with sufficient credit quality that need long-term funding can stretch their loans to 30 years or even longer. Perpetual bonds have no maturity date and pay interest forever. Credit quality stems from a combination of the issuing company\u2019s fiscal health and the length of the loan. Better health and shorter duration generally enable companies to pay less in interest. The reverse is also true. Less fiscally healthy companies and those issuing long-term debt are generally forced to pay higher interest rates to entice investors. One of the more interesting options companies have is whether to offer bonds backed by assets. These bonds give investors the right to claim a company\u2019s underlying assets if the company defaults. Such bonds are known as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). In consumer finance, car loans and home mortgages are examples of collateralized debt. Companies may also issue debt that is not backed by underlying assets. In consumer finance, credit card debt and utility bills are examples of loans that are not collateralized. Loans of this type are called unsecured debt. Unsecured debt carries a higher risk for investors, so it often pays a higher interest rate than collateralized debt. Convertible bonds are another type of bond. These bonds start just like other bonds but offer investors the opportunity to convert their holdings into a predetermined number of stock shares. In a best-case scenario, such conversions enable investors to benefit from rising stock prices and give companies a loan they don\u2019t have to repay. Finally, there are also callable bonds. They function like other bonds, but the issuer can choose to pay them off before the official maturity date. Companies issue callable bonds to allow them to take advantage of a possible drop in interest rates in the future. The issuing company can redeem callable bonds before the maturity date according to a schedule in the bond's terms. If interest rates decrease, the company can redeem the outstanding bonds and reissue the debt at a lower rate. That reduces the cost of capital. Calling a bond is similar to a mortgage borrower refinancing at a lower rate. The prior mortgage with the higher interest rate is paid off, and the borrower obtains a new mortgage at the lower rate. Callable bonds are more complex investments than normal bonds. They may not be appropriate for risk-averse investors seeking a steady stream of income. The bond terms often define the amount that must be paid to call the bond. The defined amount may be greater than the par value. The price of bonds has an inverse relationship with interest rates. Bond prices go up as interest rates fall. Thus, it can be advantageous for a company to pay off debt by recalling the bond at above par value. The advantages of callable bonds for issuing companies are often disadvantages for investors. There are many factors to consider before investing in callable bonds. Corporate bonds are issued by corporations to raise money for funding business needs. Government bonds are issued by governments to fund the government's needs, such as to pay for infrastructure projects, government employee salaries, and other programs. Corporate bonds are generally riskier than government bonds as most governments are less likely to fail than corporations. Because of this risk, corporate bonds generally provide better returns. Generally, yes, corporate bonds are safer than stocks. Corporate bonds offer a fixed rate of return, so an investor knows exactly how much their investment will return. Stocks, however, typically offer a better rate of return because they are riskier. So the money invested in a corporate bond, while it may earn 3%, might also miss out on earning more if the stock appreciates more than 3%; however, the stock also may not appreciate more than 3%. The right investment depends on the investor's risk tolerance and investment objectives. No, corporate bonds are not tax-free. An investor will have to pay taxes on the interest income earned as well as on any capital gains. For companies, the bond market clearly offers many ways to borrow. The bond market has a lot to offer investors, but they must be careful. The variety of choices, ranging from duration to interest rates, enables investors to select bonds closely aligned with their needs. This wide selection also means that investors should do their homework. They need to make sure they understand where they are putting their money. They should also know how much they will earn and when they can expect to get their money back. For investors unfamiliar with the bond market, financial advisors can provide insight and guidance as well as specific investment recommendations and advice. They can also give an overview of the risks that come with investing in bonds. These risks include rising interest rates, call risk, and the possibility of corporate bankruptcy. Bankruptcy can cost investors some or all of the amount invested. Of course, there are other approaches to dealing with the complexity of the bond market. One can invest in a bond fund, where a mutual fund manager will make all these decisions in exchange for fees. However, fees are generally much lower for aggregate bond ETFs."

            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Inflation can have a dampening effect on fixed-income investments by reducing their purchasing power and cutting their real returns over time. This happens even if the inflation rate is relatively low. If you have a portfolio that returns 9% and the inflation rate is 3%, then your real returns are about 6%. Inflation-index-linked bonds can help to hedge against inflation risk because they increase in value during inflationary periods. The United States, India, Canada, and a wide range of other countries issue inflation-linked bonds. Because they reduce uncertainty, inflation-indexed bonds are a popular long-range planning investment vehicle for individuals and institutions alike. Inflation-linked bonds are tied to the costs of consumer goods as measured by an inflation index, such as the consumer price index (CPI). Each country has its own method of calculating those costs on a regular basis. In addition, each nation has its own agency responsible for issuing inflation-linked bonds. For instance: The outstanding principal of the bond generally rises with inflation for inflation-linked bonds. So, the face or par value of the bond increases when inflation occurs. This is in contrast to other types of securities, which often decrease in value when inflation rises. The interest paid out by inflation-linked bonds is also adjusted for inflation. By providing these features, inflation-linked bonds can soften the real impact of inflation on the holders of the bonds. Inflation-linked bonds were developed during the American Revolution to combat the corrosive effects of inflation on the real value of consumer goods. Massachusetts issued inflation-indexed bonds beginning in 1780, but inflation indexing seemed unnecessary for established countries on the gold standard. Most of the world abandoned the gold standard by the 1970s, and rising inflation created a demand for inflation-linked bonds. In 1981, the U.K. began to issue the first modern inflation-linked bonds, or linkers as they are often called. Other countries followed suit, including Sweden, Canada, and Australia. The U.S. Treasury did not issue inflation-indexed bonds until 1997, and India issued capital-indexed bonds that same year; however, India did not issue fully inflation-indexed bonds, which protect both coupons and principal from inflation, until 2013. Fitch Ratings downgraded the rating for the U.S. from AAA to AA+ in Aug. 2023. The credit rating agency stated that concerns about the country's \"fiscal deterioration\" over the next three years and its high national debt caused by tax cuts and increased government spending were among the reasons for the drop. While inflation-linked bonds have considerable upside potential, there are also certain risks associated with these assets. Their value also tends to fluctuate with the rise and fall of interest rates. TIPS and many of their global inflation-linked counterparts do not offer very good protection during times of deflation, which is when prices decline. The U.S. Treasury sets an initial floor for TIPS at par value. However, the risk is still considerable because there are older TIPS issues that carry years of inflation-adjusted accruals, which can be lost to deflation. This deflation risk caused TIPS to underperform other Treasury bonds during 2008. This asset type also presents complications in trading and taxation that don't affect other fixed-income asset classes. This is mostly because inflation-linked bonds have two values: the original face value of the bond and the current value adjusted for inflation. The adjustments of the principal amount are considered annual income for tax purposes. However, investors do not actually receive the adjustments in that year. Instead, they get the larger coupon payments and only receive inflation-augmented principal when the bond matures. Thus, investors may be subject to tax on what's known as phantom income. Inflation-linked bonds are fixed-income assets that are designed to protect investors from inflation. Generally offered by federal governments, these assets are indexed to inflation. This means they are tied to inflation so the principal investment and interest portion both rise and fall with the inflation rate. In many cases, they are tied to the price index of consumer goods and services. For instance, those issued by the U.S. government are tied to the Consumer Price Index. Bonds that are linked to inflation are usually offered by federal governments. These fixed-income investments offer investors protection against inflation because they are indexed to inflation. As such, the principal and interest rises and falls with the inflation rate. Although they provide some safety, there are certain risks associated with inflation-linked bonds. For instance, investors are subject to interest rate risk. They must also consider deflation risk since these bonds are tied to the CPI in the U.S. The current rate for I bonds issued between May 1, 2023, and Oct. 31, 2023, is 4.30%. This rate includes a fixed rate of 0.90%. Despite their complicated nature and potential downside in deflationary periods, inflation-linked bonds are still enormously popular. They are the most trusted investment vehicle to hedge against short-term inflation. The corrosive effect that inflation can have on returns is a strong motivating factor behind the popularity of these bonds. An additional upside of inflation-linked bonds is that their returns do not correlate with those of stocks or with other fixed-income assets. Inflation-linked bonds are a hedge against inflation, and they also help to provide diversification in a balanced portfolio.

            "title": "Debenture vs. Bond: What's the Difference?",
            "content": "In a sense, all debentures are bonds, but not all bonds are debentures. Whenever a bond is unsecured, it can be referred to as a debenture. To complicate matters, this is the American definition of a debenture. In British usage, a debenture is a bond that is secured by company assets. In some countries, the terms are interchangeable. Debentures generally have a more specific purpose than other bonds. While both are used to raise capital, debentures typically are issued to raise capital to meet the expenses of an upcoming project or to pay for a planned expansion in business. These debt securities are a common form of long-term financing taken out by corporations. Debentures carry either a floating or a fixed-interest coupon rate return to investors and will list a repayable date. When the interest payment is due, the company will, most often, pay the interest before they pay shareholder dividends. On the due date, the company has two general choices of repayment of principal. They may pay in one lump sum or make installment payments. The installment plan is known as a debenture redemption reserve, and the company will pay a set amount each year to the investor until maturity. The terms of the debenture will be listed in the underlying documentation. Debentures are sometimes called revenue bonds because the issuer expects to repay the loans from the proceeds of the business project they helped finance. Physical assets or collateral do not back debentures. They are backed solely by the full faith and credit of the issuer. Some debentures, like other bonds, are convertible, meaning they can be converted into company stock, while others are non-convertible. Generally, investors prefer convertibles and will accept a slightly lower return to get them. Like any bond, debentures can be purchased through a broker. The convertible\u00a0debenture\u00a0can be converted into stock, and this feature will serve to dilute the per-share metrics of the stock and reduce any earnings per share (EPS). The bond is the most common type of debt instrument used by private corporations and by governments. It serves as an IOU between the issuer and an investor. An investor loans a sum of money in return for the promise of repayment at the specified maturity date. Usually, the investor also receives periodic interest payments over the duration of the bond's term. In the investing world, bonds are generally considered to be a relatively safe\u00a0investment. Highly rated corporate or government bonds come with little perceived default risk. However, each bond, including those issued by government agencies or municipalities, will carry an individual credit rating. In general, bonds are considered safe if unspectacular investments with a guaranteed rate of return. Generally, professional financial advisors encourage their clients to keep a percentage of their assets in bonds and to increase that percentage as they approach retirement age. The lack of security does not necessarily mean that a debenture is riskier than any other bond. Strictly speaking, a U.S. Treasury bond and a U.S. Treasury bill are both debentures. They are not secured by collateral, yet they are considered risk-free because they are backed by the full-faith and credit of the U.S. government. Similarly, debentures are the most common form of long-term debt instruments issued by corporations. A company might issue bonds to raise money to expand its number of retail stores. It expects to repay the money from future sales. The bond is considered as creditworthy as the company that issues it. Bonds and debentures provide companies and governments with a way to finance beyond their normal cash flows. A bond is a liability for the issuing entity, as it has to be paid when it reaches maturity. In contrast, a bond is an asset for the bond holder. As unsecured debt securities, debentures are theoretically riskier than secured bonds. This is because debenture holders have a lower chance of recouping their investment\u2014compared to secured bondholders\u2014in the event the debt issuer defaults on its obligations. Many broker-dealers allow you to purchase bonds online or over the phone using funds in your brokerage or retirement account. U.S. Treasury bonds are also available directly through the U.S. Treasury's free, official web platform, TreasuryDirect. Bonds and debentures are debt instruments that governments and companies use to raise capital. While bonds may or may not be secured by collateral such as property or assets, debentures are unsecured, meaning they have no such collateralization. Debentures are typically more risky than secured bonds, although some debentures\u2014like U.S. Treasury bonds and bills\u2014are considered low-risk investments because they are backed by U.S. government."

            "title": "Why Are My Bond ETFs Losing Money, and What Should I Do?",
            "content": "Bond ETF values drop when interest rates rise Michael Bromberg is a finance editor with a decade of experience. He is an expert at elucidating complex financial topics in clear, concise language. Michael received a Bachelor of Arts in literature from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a master's in linguistics from the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellin, Colombia. Interest rate changes are the primary culprit when bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) lose value. As interest rates rise, the prices of existing bonds fall, which impacts the value of the ETFs holding these assets. If your bond ETF loses value, you can wait out the interest rate changes or reallocate to money market accounts (MMAs), certificates of deposit (CDs), or high-yield savings accounts. Here's more on why bond ETFs drop in value and some considerations for avoiding any negative effects on your portfolio. When you buy an individual bond, you do so with the understanding that the principal will be repaid in full when the bond reaches maturity. Bond ETFs, however, hold assets with different maturity dates and buy and sell bonds as they expire or no longer match the age range that the fund targets. This means that bond ETFs do not have the same principal repayment guarantee as individual bonds. Fluctuations in the prices of bond ETFs often stem from the inverse relationship between the bond market and interest rates. Bond prices and yields moving in the opposite direction may seem counterintuitive, but the equation is simple enough. When prevailing interest rates rise, the fixed rate paid by an existing bond becomes less attractive, lowering its price. Conversely, falling interest rates make an existing bond\u2019s payouts more attractive, boosting its price. Since bond ETFs own a basket of fixed-income investments, they are not immune to interest rate risk. Increasing interest rates put downward pressure on the prices of bond ETFs, which can exasperate investors who turned to these assets, hoping to preserve their capital while generating a stream of income. The Federal Reserve\u2019s sustained campaign of interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 negatively affected the price performance of bond ETFs. If you own shares of a bond ETF, you might have a sinking feeling seeing the market value of your investment dip as interest rates increase. However, it\u2019s worth noting that rising interest rates can\u2019t last forever, and bond ETF prices are likely to recover once rates go lower. While the ability to trade shares in them easily is part of what makes bond ETFs attractive, you may want to avoid selling these assets at a depleted price. If you can wait for a different stage of the interest rate cycle, you might see a recovery in the prices of bonds and the ETFs that hold them. Similarly, when higher interest rates lower share prices in bond ETFs, the market typically presents other income-generating opportunities. Lower bond ETF prices may coincide with higher yields on cash investments such as money market accounts (MMAs), certificates of deposit (CDs), and high-yield savings accounts. A decrease in bond ETF prices is not a reason to sell in a panic, and it could be an opportunity to assess how your strategy matches up with the present economic cycle. The relative attractiveness of bond ETFs and other investments shifts in response to changing conditions, and it\u2019s up to you to ensure that you\u2019re maximizing your yield while taking on an acceptable level of risk. A bond ETF is a pooled investment security tied to a portfolio of bonds. Bond ETFs expose investors to various fixed-income assets with a specified holding period and strategy, such as investing in U.S. Treasurys or high-yield corporate bonds. Like other ETFs, bond ETFs trade throughout the day on the major stock exchanges. Trading on a centralized exchange makes bond ETFs significantly more liquid than individual bonds, which must be bought from a bond broker or through bond mutual funds, and they change hands only once daily. This flexibility can be helpful when turmoil hits the bond market, since you can trade bond ETFs even when the fixed-income markets experience distress. As a bond ETF investor, you get income through regular (usually monthly) dividend payouts. Bond ETFs also pay any capital gains as an annual dividend. Although these capital gains payouts may increase your tax bill, the effect is generally minimal, as bond returns don\u2019t generate capital gains in the same way as stock investments. For bonds, yield refers to the percentage return that an investor should expect to make. In technical terms, a bond\u2019s yield is the relationship between its coupon\u2014or the interest it pays out\u2014and its current market value. When a bond\u2019s price goes down, its yield goes up, while a drop in yield means higher bond prices. While the yield of an individual bond is relatively straightforward, bond ETFs are more complex. Since these investments represent a portfolio of many different bonds, it can be difficult to understand a bond ETF\u2019s overall yield. But there are some approaches to doing so. One common measure is the average yield to maturity: Take the weighted average yield of the bonds in the portfolio, and assume that the assets are held until maturity. However, this might not align with the practices of particular bond ETFs, which often sell bonds before they mature, and it doesn\u2019t account for the expenses charged by the ETF. Other alternatives include determining a bond ETF\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 30-day yield and representing the dividend and interest payouts over the past month after subtracting expenses. You can also calculate a bond ETF\u2019s yield by dividing recent distributions over its net asset value, or you can look at the 12-month yield to quantify an ETF\u2019s real-world behavior for the past year. These measures frequently give you different results, so it could be useful to consider several of them together when looking at the yield of a bond ETF, especially if you\u2019re using these calculations to compare funds and make investment decisions. The yield you can expect to earn from a bond ETF depends on the type of bonds in the fund\u2019s portfolio. Corporate bonds tend to pay higher yields because they present greater risk, while yields are lower for less risky government bonds. Conventional wisdom holds that your investment strategy should become more conservative as you approach retirement or another important goal. In many cases, this means shifting more of a portfolio to bonds, which can offer a steady income stream and potentially less risk than stocks. When you buy an individual bond, it stipulates that the principal will be repaid at maturity, and you can design your bond purchases to mature at set intervals for income. You might be drawn to ETFs that invest in bonds because bonds are generally safer investments. However, bond ETFs never mature\u2014the ETF holdings must be adjusted to try and meet the fund's goals. Active management exposes your initial investment to greater levels of risk. Moreover, rising interest rates hurt the price of bond ETFs, with prices of the underlying (existing) bonds dipping as yields increase. If prices stay down, you may never recover your principal by the time you had planned to. Like all investments, bond ETFs have their pros and cons. Tradable on stock exchanges and accessible to retail investors, bond ETFs represent an easy way to invest in a diversified portfolio in a general or specific bond market segment. However, it\u2019s important to check the expense ratio of bond ETFs. In addition, rising interest rates can send bond ETF prices lower, exposing investors to losses. Investors may benefit from holding bond ETFs longer to wait out such dips. Bond are used by many to preserve capital and create a source of income. Bond ETFs, during prolonged periods of rising rates, might cause you to lose a significant portion of your principal. In August 2024, the largest bond ETF in the U.S. was the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, which held $115 billion in net assets. Changes in interest rates can have a significant effect on bond ETFs and other fixed-income investments. Increasing interest rates tend to make bonds and bond ETFs tumble. For this reason, bond ETFs may be more appropriate for those who can tolerate the interest rate risk and hold the asset over a long period, particularly if you need to wait for a shift in the interest rate environment. etf.com. \u201cBond ETFs Tumble to 2023 Lows as Rates Surge.\u201d iShares. \"iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF.\""

            "title": "Bond Vigilantes: Definition, Examples, What They Do, and Why",
            "content": "How Powerful Debt Holders Try To Shape Government Policy Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Investopedia / Julie Bang Bond vigilantes are investors who sell government bonds in response to fiscal policies they view as inflationary or irresponsible, driving up borrowing costs for the government. In depictions ranging from Westerns to the gritty urban streets of 1970s cinema to the Batman franchise, vigilantes are morally ambiguous figures who take the law into their own hands. Heroes to some, dangerous outlaws to others, they act outside the law to address perceived injustices they say the system is too inept or corrupt to address. Today's financial markets have their own self-appointed guardians: bond vigilantes. The phrase was coined by the economist Ed Yardeni in the 1980s to describe investors he said had sold off scores of Treasury bonds to protest Federal Reserve policies they deemed too inflationary. Unlike their cinematic counterparts, these influential traders aren't prowling dark alleys to take on the denizens of the underworld. Instead, they wield market power by selling government bonds en masse to drive up borrowing costs and force policy changes. Like their namesakes, these market enforcers see themselves as imposing fiscal discipline when official institutions won't. Yardeni argues that they've flexed their muscle during key moments: pushing for anti-inflationary measures in the early 1980s, during the Clinton administration in the 1990s, in the early Obama years, and, most recently, following former President Donald Trump's 2024 election victory, when U.S. Treasury yields surged from 4.290% to 4.425% in a single day\u2014a sudden jump attributed to concerns about potential fiscal expansion and tax cuts under the new administration. \u201cBond investors are the economy\u2019s bond vigilantes,\u201d Yardeni has claimed. \u201cSo if the fiscal and monetary authorities won\u2019t regulate the economy, the bond investors will. The economy will be run by vigilantes in the credit markets.\u201d Below, we discuss the history of this idea and look at particular episodes of supposed bond vigilantism\u2014to understand their power in the bond markets and as self-appointed guardians of the government purse. The weapon of choice for a bond vigilante is the bond yield, which is the interest rate governments pay to borrow from investors. When bond prices rise, yields automatically fall because they have an inverse relationship\u2014higher yields aren't needed to attract bond buyers. It works similarly going the other direction: when bond prices fall first, yields are forced to rise. As such, when there's aggressive selling by bondholders, this raises borrowing costs for future government debt issues. Even the threat is felt to be enough to change the behavior of governments. Higher bond yields affect the stock markets since they increase borrowing costs for companies and reduce the relative attractiveness of equities against bonds. In addition, rising yields can lead to a feedback loop, pressuring the U.S. Federal Reserve or another central bank to maintain or even raise interest rates, for instance, to keep inflation expectations at bay. Although changes in yields don\u2019t impact bondholders who hold previously purchased bonds to maturity, they can significantly alter the cost of borrowing for issuers, such as the U.S. Treasury. So why would bondholders sell? According to Yardeni, these sellers aim to \"punish\" the issuer for engaging in loose monetary or fiscal policies. Yardeni came up with the term during rising inflation in the early 1980s. The Fed was initially dovish at the time, leaving rates essentially alone. After all, the U.S. went through a period with the highest interest rates of the contemporary period, and a tepid recovery was finally underway. Yardeni says bond vigilantes emerged to protest this policy, believing rates needed to be much higher to curb inflationary pressures. Ultimately, by forcing higher interest rates, the vigilantes were saying curbing inflation was more important than protecting the fragile economic recovery. According to Yardeni, selling Treasurys en masse had its intended effect. Rates soon rose, with the vigilantes pushing the Fed into a more hawkish stance against inflation. Yardeni has continued to comment on bond vigilantes in the decades since he coined the phrase, arguing that their actions help maintain economic stability by pressuring governments toward more sustainable policies. Since the 1980s, Yardeni has more than just neutrally characterized bond vigilantes; they serve as a crucial form of market discipline against what he views as unsustainable fiscal or monetary policies. While Yardeni tends to avoid aligning explicitly with either Republican or Democratic political agendas, his theory aligns with a neoliberal perspective that emphasizes market-driven constraints over government intervention. In this way, bond vigilantes are said to act as a check on inflation and excessive debt by pressuring for fiscal and monetary policy discipline, stepping in when officials, engaging in the everyday politics of being responsive to voter pressure, might be led to maintain loose fiscal policies. While bond vigilante actions can signal market discomfort with fiscal policies, they also open up investment opportunities. For instance, rising yields might benefit sectors sensitive to interest rates, such as financials, but could hurt bond-heavy portfolios. The ambiguity of vigilantes in movie depictions survives when they enter the bond markets. For some, bond vigilantes are necessary for fiscal and monetary policy stability. For others, they are part of a significant power shift from state sovereignty over monetary and fiscal policy to unofficial economic actors taking it upon themselves to \"regulate the economy\" for the state. Bond vigilantes are not limited to the U.S.; they have reportedly played pivotal roles in markets worldwide. For example, during the eurozone debt crisis of the early 2010s, bond vigilantes are said to have sold off the sovereign debt of countries like Greece, Italy, and Spain to force a change in their fiscal policies. The sell-off caused yields to soar, putting massive pressure on these countries to adopt austerity measures to reassure markets and stabilize their finances. Emerging markets are also vulnerable to the influence of bond vigilantes, who can react swiftly to signs of political instability, currency risks, or unsustainable fiscal policies. Their moves can trigger rapid capital outflows, currency devaluations, and spikes in borrowing costs. Countries with a lot of external debt, such as Argentina and Turkey, have faced the effects of these market pressures, which often prompt policy changes to mitigate the economic fallout. As such, while there is skepticism about whether bond vigilantes can significantly impact U.S. markets, this is less prevalent concerning bond markets abroad. In smaller economies, these lack the depth, liquidity, and protection offered by the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. As a result, institutional or national holders of debt wield considerable influence, causing rapid market reactions when bond vigilantes sell off government debt because of concerns over fiscal mismanagement, inflation, or political turmoil. However, distinguishing the actions of bond vigilantes from rational investor behavior in the market can be challenging. What some see as markets enforcing discipline may simply reflect investors adjusting their positions based on changing economic realities. In the U.S., the presence of bond vigilantes is more theoretical, while abroad, that's less the case given the smaller size of those markets. In September 2022, newly appointed U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss unveiled a sweeping economic plan to stimulate growth through major tax cuts and deregulation. Known as the \"mini-budget,\" the plan included \u00a345 billion in unfunded tax cuts\u2014the largest such package in decades\u2014alongside measures to cap energy prices amid a global energy crisis. The proposal was said to be needed to revive the country's economic activity and strengthen its competitiveness. The plan relied on a major increase in government borrowing when inflation was already high. The market's reaction was immediate and negative. Investors, fearing that the proposed policies would lead to a surge in government debt and further stoke inflation, began dumping U.K. government bonds (gilts). That caused gilt yields to soar, which dramatically increased the cost of borrowing for the U.K. government while sending shock waves throughout the financial system. The mini-budget managed to produce an immediate, short-term economic crisis\u2014and that was before it was even enacted. The pound fell to historic lows against the dollar, and the volatility posed severe risks to pension funds that were heavily exposed to gilts, prompting the Bank of England to intervene to stabilize markets. Paul Krugman, the Nobel laureate, economist, and New York Times columnist, noted an irony of this episode: typically, it's conservative (in Britain, Tory) representatives and commentators warning that governments need to cut spending or otherwise change course, lest they face the wrath of the bond vigilantes. In other words, the threat of bond vigilante actions is typically part of a call for conservative policy aims. \"Such warnings are usually proved wrong,\" Krugman wrote then. \"In Britain, however, the bond vigilantes actually did make an appearance: Interest rates shot up after the Truss government announced its economic plans. But the market wasn\u2019t reacting to excessive spending; it was reacting to irresponsible tax cuts.\" Within weeks, Truss was forced to kill off the central plans for her premiership\u2014then she was gone from office altogether. With a tenure of just 44 days in office, Truss' tenure was the shortest of any British prime minister. While it's normally thought that the \"market\" favors tax cuts, the Truss affair shows that the desire of some market participants to keep more of their gains (leaving more for investment capital to grow the economy, they argue) is often countered by the needs of bondholders\u2014who are quite mindful that tax cuts might leave the state less able to pay its debts. 1980-1981: The period saw a significant sell-off in bonds as investors reacted (either to runaway inflation or Fed monetary policy guidance) in the U.S., after which then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker raised interest rates aggressively, which led to a recession. \u201cEven before the Fed really started to aggressively raise interest rates,\" Yardeni has said, \"the bond vigilantes figured it out and kind of jumped ahead of the line and pushed interest rates up dramatically.\u201d 1993-1994 (Clinton administration): In the mid-1990s, bond traders became frustrated with the massive government spending that initially occurred under the Clinton administration, driving yields on 10-year Treasurys up from around 5% to 8% over a year. Once Clinton scrapped plans for national health insurance reform and pushed a series of more conservative policies, yields dropped. 2009-2010 (Post-financial crisis stimulus): Following the financial crisis and recession of 2008, bond markets reacted strongly to increased government borrowing and stimulus spending to boost an economy in tatters at the start of the Great Recession. Yields rose as investors feared inflation and unsustainable debt levels, although Fed policies later helped contain these effects. 2011 (European sovereign debt crisis): Following the 2008 financial crisis, several European economies\u2014primarily Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain\u2014entered a debt crisis. Recognizing the massive amounts of liabilities due, yields on sovereign debt in these countries exploded. Yardeni argues that the increased yield was the work of bond vigilantes. \u201cWhen those\u00a0Greek bond yields\u00a0went up to 40%, [bond holders] were clearly screaming that something was just dead wrong with the way that country was being run, and things changed and those bond yields came down,\u201d he's explained. 2013 (\"taper tantrum\"): Although not solely about fiscal deficits, the market reaction to then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke\u2019s comments on slowing the pace of bond purchases (\u201ctapering\u201d quantitative easing) led to a sudden spike in U.S. Treasury yields. This reaction reflected bond vigilantes' supposed influence over expectations of inflation and government borrowing costs. Late 2016-2017 (Trump's first election): Bond vigilantes were said to be active after Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory, as markets anticipated tax cuts, infrastructure spending, and deregulation, driving up yields as investors anticipated larger deficits and potential inflation. 2020-2021 (pandemic spending): The massive stimulus packages in response to the pandemic initially led to a spike in bond yields in early 2021. Investors were concerned that continued stimulus and monetary easing would lead to inflation and further debt accumulation. 2024 (Trump's second election): There was a reported bond vigilante reaction to Trump's 2024 election victory that drove up Treasury yields. As the examples of bond vigilante episodes make clear, like their movie counterparts, bond vigilantes don't always come off as on the \"good side.\" Critics argue they make it difficult for countries to recover from recessions and even pandemic-era calamities. By making borrowing more expensive, they also make it more difficult for countries to pay off their debts. In late 2024, bond vigilantes are said to have responded considerably to President-elect Trump's economic proposals. When Trump confirmed plans postelection to extend the 2017 tax cuts and eliminate taxes on tips and Social Security benefits, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes jumped from 4.290% to 4.425% in just one day. The vigilantes\u2019 primary concerns centered on America\u2019s growing debt burden. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated Trump\u2019s proposals would increase the national debt by $8 trillion or more over the subsequent decade. For this reason, most media reports gave responsibility for the the bond vigilante's moves to Trump. Yardeni pointed out in a commentary at the time that one shouldn't just focus on the policies of Trump as what the bondholders were responding to. He noted two reasons for the bond vigilantes to be sending out signals: Critics like Paul Krugman and economic historian Adam Tooze contend that there is little evidence to support any genuine instances of bond vigilantism. The usual description suggests that bond vigilantes protest government policies by selling off government bonds en masse, driving up interest rates. However, Tooze argues that this portrayal is baseless and often relies on coincidence rather than evidence. Tooze further posits that it is difficult to prove any bond market sell-off as a coordinated effort by market \"enforcers\" rather than a response to shifting policy signals. This casts doubt on more expansive claims, such as Ed Yardeni's assertion that there have been periods where \"the economy [was] run by vigilantes in the credit markets.\" When bond vigilantes act, they aren't just taking on the loose monetary or fiscal policies they disagree with. Their efforts can help raise Americans' interest rates for mortgages, credit cards, etc. But on the other side of the ledger, when interest rates go up, retirees with bonds and those with savings accounts also get a bump in their interest payments. Tooze's analysis of the 1980s bond sell-off, which first prompted Yardeni\u2019s theory, suggests that bond traders\u2019 actions could be explained by two distinct motivations that would appear identical from an analyst's perspective: Tooze and others note that the vigilante narrative implies a degree of coordination among major bond traders to drive up yields\u2014coordination that would be difficult to achieve without shared intent or timing. Without this alignment, traders risk selling their bonds to little effect. Moreover, such trades carry significant opportunity costs, including forgoing Treasury interest, making signaling policy disapproval far costlier and less efficient than other methods of influence, such as lobbying or public commentary. Proponents of the idea that bond vigilantes exist might reply and say there aren't such costs since it makes little sense for bond traders to liquidate profitable positions unless they stand to gain. If one trader aggressively sells bonds to signal disapproval of fiscal policies, competitors could seize the chance by offering lower prices to buy those bonds, capitalizing on the situation. Therefore, the argument goes traders would only act like \"vigilantes\" when there is a clear profit incentive. At this point, however, the need for two competing explanations seems redundant. The primary motivation for selling bonds is market-driven profit\u2014not sending a policy-correcting signal. The more straightforward and intuitive explanation is that traders respond to market cues, such as anticipated rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, making existing lower-yielding bonds less attractive. Much like someone selling a 3% certificate of deposit when newer ones offer 5%, bond traders would be repositioning their portfolios in response to changing market conditions, not acting as enforcers of fiscal discipline. This approach follows expected market behavior and requires fewer assumptions, aligning with Occam's Razor's principle of simplicity. Critics argue that modern financial markets are too complex to attribute moves to any single group of vigilantes. They wonder why it helps to attribute such changes to collective intentions (the aims of the bond vigilantes) when the invisible hand of individual trades works well enough. Occam\u2019s razor\u2014the philosophical principle that the simplest explanation is usually correct\u2014can lead critics to view elaborate stories of bond vigilantes policing central bankers and fiscally imprudent politicians as unnecessary when a straightforward market-driven explanation suffices. This perspective helps explain the skepticism expressed by Tooze and others regarding the existence of bond vigilantes. When markets appear to \"attack\" government policy through bond sell-offs, they may simply be responding rationally to policy signals. The resulting effect\u2014higher borrowing costs for the government\u2014remains the same, making it difficult and arguably unnecessary to distinguish between coordinated market discipline and routine trading reactions to shifts in monetary policy. Even Yardeni acknowledges that proving the influence of bond vigilantes in large markets like U.S. Treasurys is nearly impossible from an empirical standpoint. Nevertheless, he continues to assert that these vigilantes were responsible for driving up yields in the 1980s and have reemerged at key moments, including in late 2024. \"What we often attribute to bond vigilantes may actually be markets amplifying decisions already made by central banks,\" economic historian Adam Tooze argues. \"It's less like independent sheriffs enforcing the law and more like deputized forces acting with official approval.\" There are perhaps other reasons for skepticism: Modern bond markets are deeply entrenched within a system with a bunch of actors playing off one another, from central banks to government debt managers to those in the market for complex financial plumbing like repo (repurchase agreements) markets. Given these considerations, it may be most productive to view bond vigilantes through two complementary lenses: This isn't to imply that bond markets lack influence; shifts in yields can and do constrain nations' ability to borrow, often prompting changes in fiscal or monetary policy.\u00a0Nor is it that one should or shouldn't support the policy wishes of those on the lookout for bond vigilantes forming their posse just over the horizon. In addition, market sentiment does help drive bond yields. If a significant number of large institutional investors (like pension funds, hedge funds, etc.) become bearish on the ability of the U.S. to sustain its debt, they could contribute to yield fluctuations through selling pressures. However, such moves would need to be massive and sustained to make a dent in the vast Treasury market, and any resulting spikes might still be counteracted by central bank interventions. Ultimately, bond market movements often reflect more subtle interactions, driven by what economists term \"reflexive relationships\" between fiscal and monetary policies and the supply-demand developments within interconnected fixed-income markets. If you read more about the debates around bond vigilantes, you'll soon come upon Krugman's critique of what he refers to as the \"confidence fairy\"\u2014a satirical term he coined to challenge the belief that financial markets could be appeased through austerity measures, leading to a magical boost in economic growth. During the Great Recession following the 2008 Financial Crisis, some policymakers promoted the idea that spending cuts could inspire market confidence, theoretically stimulating economic activity enough to offset the drag on demand caused by reduced government spending. Similarly, he critiques the bond vigilante narrative for attributing near-mythical influence to traders' judgments about fiscal policy. In Krugman's view, this anthropomorphizing of market forces overstates their ability to \"discipline\" governments and distorts economic policy debates. Krugman points to historical evidence to support his critique, noting that in cases such as the U.S. and U.K. following the 2008 Financial Crisis, austerity measures correlated with slower economic growth. This, he argues, undermines the notion that market-driven demands for fiscal discipline inherently lead to the kind of market confidence that sparks growth. The debate over bond vigilantes and market confidence fairies doesn't sound very serious, but it reflects a deep divide in economics: Keynesians argue government spending can effectively boost growth during downturns, while their opponents (often called \"neoliberals\" or \"market monetarists\") argue that calming financial markets through spending restraint and a hardline against inflation is more important for economic stability. The concept of bond vigilantes illustrates how market participants, particularly large investors, can influence the behavior of security issuers, such as governments. While it may be an overstatement to describe markets as \u201cpunishing\u201d wayward policies like human agents, shifts\u2014or even the threat of them\u2014in bond market demand can impact fiscal and monetary policies. Other groups within the market wield similar influence, and their intentional and coordinated actions are often more transparent. One such group is activist investors, who acquire substantial equity stakes to drive changes in corporate strategy or management. By amassing enough voting rights, they can secure seats on the board of directors and even replace key executives, including the CEO. In addition, activist investors may threaten to sell their shares, thereby depressing the company's stock price and reducing its market value\u2014a tactic called \u201cthe power of exit.\u201d Other influential market players include short sellers and hedge fund activists, whose activities are driven by more than responses to supply and demand. The table below highlights key market actors and their impact, showcasing how and when their influence has been most pronounced. One example of a bond vigilante is PIMCO, a bond fund with almost $2 trillion in assets. Under ex-manager Bill Gross, PIMCO famously divested from U.S. government bonds because Gross felt that the government\u2019s spending deficit couldn't be solved. From the mid-2000s to 2020 or so, bond vigilantes were said to be stymied by the efforts of central banks to keep interest rates very low, especially following the Great Recession. The use of measures like quantitative easing made it difficult for the mere act of selling bonds to have a significant influence on bond yields. Bond prices and interest rates are inversely related\u2014when interest rates (yields) go up, bond prices go down. But when bond prices rise, yields fall. Selling bonds depresses their prices, pushing interest rates up and making it more costly for the issuer to borrow. Coined by Ed Yardeni in the 1980s, the term \"bond vigilante\" has become synonymous with bond market activism, even if it's unclear what effect such activism has in today's massive Treasurys markets. Bond vigilantes are believed to serve as a market-driven check on fiscal and monetary policy, stepping in when government borrowing or inflation risks appear excessive. However, it's better to consider the phrase a rhetorical device to call attention to the expected results of policies being critiqued or as a way of describing impersonal market forces acting in a way that forces a policy change.

            "content": "Bonds are the gift that keeps on giving Daniel Liberto is a journalist with over 10 years of experience working with publications such as the Financial Times, The Independent, and Investors Chronicle. If you are wracking your brain trying to figure out what to get your loved ones as a holiday or other type of gift, consider adding bonds to your shortlist. These investments aren\u2019t particularly flashy, so don\u2019t expect such a gift to be met with extreme initial excitement, even if it's the best savings bonds available. Hugs and high-fives are usually spurred by instant gratification, not a piece of paper that could be potentially worth something more over the years. Still, that\u2019s not to say that giving a bond as a gift is a bad idea. These investments can provide the start of a nice nest egg for the recipient\u2019s future as well as offer a useful lesson in saving and managing money. The best gifts often are those that may appreciate well into the future. Based on that logic, you can\u2019t really go wrong with buying your loved ones a potentially lucrative bond investment. When you take out a loan, you are expected to pay interest to the lender and eventually pay back the money, or principal. Bonds work in the same way\u2014only this time, you, the investor, become the lender. There are several different categories of bonds, with each type named after the entity to which the money is being lent. In other words, a government bond involves lending money to a government entity, while a corporate bond essentially involves lending money to corporations. When you lend money to a government, company, or another entity, the amount of interest that you are paid as compensation for your investment usually depends on the health of the borrower. As a general rule of thumb, the higher the risk that the borrower may default on the loan and may be unable to pay it back, the greater the interest rate payment you\u2019ll receive for the additional risk. Many U.S.-based gift givers will find that savings bonds check most of their desired boxes. These securities essentially offer citizens the opportunity to lend money to the U.S. government to help fund federal spending. In exchange, the people putting up the capital are rewarded with interest payments until the loan is eventually repaid. The beauty of savings bonds is that because they are backed by the U.S. Treasury, they are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. They\u2019re also really easy to gift and can be affordable. With corporate bonds, you typically need to cough up at least $1,000 for a minimum purchase. Savings bonds, on the other hand, can be bought for as little as $25. Interest on U.S. savings bonds is paid only after they mature and are redeemed. There are two common types of savings bonds: Series EE Bonds and Series I Bonds. Both are sold at face value, have an annual purchase limit of $10,000, and pay interest, which accrues monthly and is compounded semiannually, until the 30th year. The key distinctions that separate the two are the rate of interest that they pay out and also that Series I Bonds can be purchased in paper format with an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax refund. Before deciding which savings bond to opt for as a gift, it would be wise to consider the outlook for interest rates and inflation, as well as how long you expect the recipient to hold it. If the gift isn\u2019t going to be cashed in for at least 20 years, and if inflation and interest rates are likely to fall in that period, then the Series EE Bond probably makes more sense. Conversely, the prospect of rising living costs, rate hikes, and an earlier withdrawal would make the Series I Bond a better option. Fixed rate for 20 years. Rate may change for the last ten years of the bond's maturity. Guaranteed to double in value after 20 years. Earns interest monthly, compounded semiannually. Exempt from state and local income tax. Only available as electronic bonds. Limited to buying $10,000 in bonds per year. Interest rate that is a composite of a fixed rate and an inflation-based rate calculated twice per year. Earns interest monthly, compounded semiannually. Exempt from state and local income tax. Available as paper bonds and electronically. Paper bonds are only available when buying bonds with your tax refund. Limited to buying $10,000 in electronic, $5,000 in paper bonds per year. Series EE Bonds issued after May 2005 pay a fixed interest rate that\u2019s determined at the time of purchase and guaranteed for the first 20 years, making them ideal when rates are higher than normal and likely to fall. They also come with a promise of doubling in value if kept for 20 years. Series I Bonds (aka TIPS, or Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) don\u2019t make such promises but instead deliver another benefit: protection against inflation. These bonds provide a semiannually adjustable variable rate on top of a fixed rate, giving the owner peace of mind that they won\u2019t erode in value due to inflation. The main place that you can buy savings bonds is through the U.S. government site TreasuryDirect. The government sells bonds directly to people through this site. EE Bonds are only available for purchase through TreasuryDirect. You can no longer purchase paper EE Bonds. I Bonds are available as both electronic and paper bonds, but you can only purchase I Bonds using any money the IRS owes you when you file your tax return and the annual limit on paper I Bonds is lower than the annual limit on electronic I Bonds. If you have electronic bonds in your TreasuryDirect account, you can check the balance and current interest rate of the bond by signing into your account. You'll also be able to view information such as the final maturity date and the next date on which interest will accrue. If you have paper bonds, TreasuryDirect has a calculator that you can use to check its value and other details. By entering the bond series, denomination, serial number, and issue date, the calculator can provide you the bond's value from January 1996 to the present. Over time, savings bonds gain value due to the interest that the government pays. Both EE and I bonds earn interest monthly, with interest compounding semiannually. That means that twice each year, the bond's principal value increases and the added interest will start earning interest. Series EE Bonds offer a unique feature where they are guaranteed to double in value when held for twenty years. If the bond doubles in value in fewer than twenty years, this feature has no effect. This means that if you hold an EE Bond for twenty years, it will offer a return equivalent to it having a 3.496% interest rate at worst. Determining the value of an EE Bond over time is relatively easy given its fixed rate and automatic doubling after twenty years. Using a compound interest calculator can let you determine its future value. Finding the value of an I Bond in the future is more difficult because its interest rate will adjust every six months based on inflation. Maximizng your return on savings bonds requires a few different things. First is timing the purchase of your bonds properly. EE Bonds offer a fixed interest rate and a portion of the interest paid by I Bonds is also fixed. Buying bonds when rates are high will offer greater returns than buying bonds when their returns are low. For EE Bonds in particular, holding them for at least twenty years ensures they will double in value. Ensuring you hold them for a long enough period will increase your potential returns. Finally, you need to avoid penalties. With both EE and I Bonds, you must hold the bond for at least twelve months before cashing it in. However, if you cash in a bond within five years of buying it, you'll pay a penalty equal to three months' interest. Holding a bond for at least five years will let you avoid this penalty. There are limits on buying savings bonds. Each year, you can purchase a total of: It's important to note that these limits apply per Social Security number. That means that you and a spouse can buy up to these limits each, even if you file joint tax returns. It also means that bonds that are given as a gift count toward the limit of the recipient rather than the person giving the bond. If you have reached your annual savings bond limit, you might consider having your spouse purchase bonds or buying gift bonds for a dependent or friend. If government savings bonds aren\u2019t your style, bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a great way to gift multiple bonds in one transaction. Broad-based bond ETFs typically contain a mix of government, agency, corporate, and municipal debt issues. You can choose index-based ETFs (which usually have the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 or the Bloomberg Aggregate ETF Tracker as their benchmarks) such as BND, AGG, and BNDX (includes foreign bonds), among many others. Or you can opt for more specific types of bonds, such as bank loans, or Chinese-issued bonds. Most bond ETFs only hold investment-grade bonds (>BBB), to be attractive to conservative-minded investors. There is virtually an ETF for most any country or duration, or holding period, which should make your decision a lot easier. You can search the web for the specific bond (or fixed-income) ETF that covers the sector, region, or index to which you\u2019re attracted, and you\u2019re likely to get many selections back from which to choose. Also, to make ETFs even more attractive, they function like regular shares and can be bought and sold on a fractional basis. If buying a corporate bond ($1,000 face value) is beyond your gifting budget, a bond ETF may be the answer you\u2019re looking for. As with most other securities today, you can buy a fractional amount, or dollar-based amount, that fits your gift-giving generosity. In this case, you\u2019re interested in gifting a corporate bond to your recipient. For example, let\u2019s say BND is trading at $71.30, but you\u2019re only thinking of gifting $50 for your present. With fractional shares, you can buy exactly $50 of BND for your gift and thereby stick to your gift-giving budget. Savings bonds can be purchased from the U.S. Treasury Department, banks, and credit unions. Often, the simplest way to buy them as a gift is through the TreasuryDirect website. The process is fairly straightforward, and there are plenty of useful guides and tutorials available on the site to help guide you through it. In short, you\u2019ll need to take the following steps: Once the savings bond has been gifted, the recipient can withdraw the proceeds at any point after 12 months. However, it\u2019s generally advisable to leave the bond alone for at least five years\u2014or 20 years, in the case of the Series EE version. Actually cashing in is simple. All the recipient needs to do is log in to their TreasuryDirect account and follow the instructions to redeem the bond. Once this task has been completed satisfactorily, the cash value should be credited to the designated bank account within two business days. Before collecting the proceeds from their gift, the recipient should check what the bond is worth. For paper bonds, this can be achieved by logging in to your account and using the TreasuryDirect savings bond calculator. Remember, most savings bonds stop earning interest after 30 years, and those sold within five years are subject to a penalty\u2014if the recipient sells before then, they\u2019ll lose three months\u2019 worth of interest. A U.S. savings bond will earn interest monthly and compound semiannually until it is either redeemed or has reached its maturity of 30 years. U.S. government bonds, unlike corporate bonds, are not subject to state income tax. The owner of a savings bond is only taxed at the federal level, and because interest payments are not distributed until the investment matures or is redeemed, paying any taxes on them is not necessary until later.Most people will take advantage of this option and defer reporting interest on these bonds until they actually receive the money. In this case, they would declare the total amount that they received from their investment on their federal income tax return in the year when it matured or was sold. The option of reporting interest accrued every year to the IRS shouldn\u2019t always be completely written off, though. For example, this might make sense if the savings bond is registered in a child\u2019s name. The logic here is that the child will likely be earning little to no income and thus be in a lower tax bracket than they presumably will be in later years, when the bond matures. It\u2019s also worth bearing in mind that interest from U.S. savings bonds may be excluded from federal income tax if the proceeds are used to pay higher education expenses. EE and I Bonds are two types of U.S. saving bonds. What distinguishes them mainly is the returns that they offer. With an EE Bond, the interest rate is fixed and there\u2019s a guarantee that it will double in value if held onto for 20 years. I Bonds function differently. What they offer is a rate that moves with inflation, ensuring that payouts are protected from rising living costs. Not according to TreasuryDirect. Once purchased, it\u2019s necessary to wait five business days to deliver the savings bond gift. However, it\u2019s also possible to hold onto the bond for much longer before giving it away. Should the bond mature before it has been delivered to the beneficiary, its monetary value will be held in a gift box within the owner\u2019s TreasuryDirect account for them to collect and present to the recipient. Yes. When you receive money from an investment, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) must be notified. Fortunately,\u00a0savings bonds aren\u2019t taxed at the state and local levels, meaning any interest earned is only subject to federal income tax. In addition, because interest isn\u2019t distributed until the bond matures or is redeemed, it\u2019s not necessary to keep the IRS informed about how much the bond is generating in income every tax year. If you wish, you don\u2019t need to declare anything until the bond eventually pays out. Rather than a gift of stock, which could drop in value over time, gift-givers may want to look at giving bonds as a financial present. Highly rated bonds (>BBB) represent a lower-risk investment and are most likely to meet all of their financial obligations, such as paying interest and paying back the principal. The gift of a bond is also a great way to get the recipient more involved in savings and investing by teaching lifelong money management skills. Government savings bonds (EE and I) are among the simplest and most convenient ways to give a bond investment. Investors can transact saving bonds easily through the U.S. government\u2019s TreasuryDirect website, where various savings bonds can be purchased. Alternatively, you can seek out an appropriate bond ETF and purchase it on a fractional basis, or for a fixed U.S. dollar amount.

            "title": "An Overview of Perpetual Bonds",
            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. When companies and governments aspire to raise money, they may issue bonds. Investors who purchase those bonds are essentially extending loans to the issuing entities. In this situation, in exchange for these loans, the issuer agrees to make interest payments to the\u00a0bond buyer, for a specific period. As the name suggests, with perpetual bonds, the agreed-upon period over which interest will be paid, is forever\u2014perpetuity. In this respect, perpetual bonds function similarly to dividend-paying stocks or certain preferred securities. Just as owners of such stock receive dividend payments for the entire time the stock is held, perpetual bond owners receive interest payments, for as long as they hold onto the bond. Investors can determine what they will earn (the bond\u2019s yield if held until maturity) by performing a relatively simple calculation, using the following formula: Current\u00a0Yield\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nAnnual\u00a0Dollar\u00a0Interest\u00a0Paid\n\n\nMarket\u00a0Price\n\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\\text{Current Yield} = \\frac{\\text{Annual Dollar Interest Paid}}{\\text{Market Price}}*100\\%\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Yield=Market\u00a0PriceAnnual\u00a0Dollar\u00a0Interest\u00a0Paid\u200b\u2217100% As an example, a\u00a0bond with a $100 par value, paying a coupon rate of 5%, and trading at the discounted price of $95.92 would have a current yield of 5.21%. Thus the calculation would be as follows: (\n\n\n$\n\n\n100\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n95.92\n\n\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n=\n\n\n5.21\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\\frac{(\\$100*0.05)} {\\$95.92} * 100\\% = 5.21\\%\n\n\n$95.92($100\u22170.05)\u200b\u2217100%=5.21% Keep in mind that perpetual bonds have no maturity date, therefore payments theoretically continue forever. Since money loses value over time, due to inflation and other causes, over time, the interest rate payments made by a perpetual bond have less value to investors. The price of a perpetual bond is, therefore, the fixed interest payment, or coupon amount, divided by the discount rate, with the discount rate\u00a0representing\u00a0the speed at which money loses value over time. For perpetual bonds that offer growing perpetuity, yet another mathematical formula can be employed to determine its value. The British government is widely credited with creating the first perpetual bond, back in the 18th century. Although they\u2019re currently not nearly as popular as Treasury bonds and municipal bonds, many economists believe perpetual bonds are attractive capital raising solutions for indebted global governments. On the other hand, fiscal conservatives generally oppose the prospect of issuing any debt\u00a0\u2013 let alone bonds that perpetually pay interest to holders. Nevertheless, perpetual bonds are recognized as a viable money-raising solution, during troubled economic times. Yale\u2019s Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library has a bond issued by Dutch water authority Stichtse Rijnlanden in 1648, which still pays interest. Perpetual bonds fundamentally afford fiscally-challenged governments an opportunity to raise money without the obligation of paying it back. Several factors support this phenomenon. Primarily, interest rates are extraordinarily low for longer-term debt. Secondly, in periods of rising inflation, investors actually lose money on loans they make to governments. For example, when investors receive a 0.5% interest rate, where inflation is 1%, the resulting inflation-adjusted interest rate of return is -0.5%. Consequently, when investors receive money back from the government, their buying power is drastically diminished. Consider a scenario where an investor loans the government $100, and one year later, the investment's value\u00a0climbs to $100.50, courtesy of the 0.5% interest rate. However, due to a 1% inflation rate, it now requires $101 to purchase the same basket of goods that cost just $100 one year ago, therefore the investor\u2019s rate of return fails to keep pace with rising inflation. Most economists expect inflation to increase over time. As such, lending out money at a hypothetical 4% interest rate seems like a bargain to government bean counters, who believe the future inflation rate could spike to 5% in the near future. Of course, most perpetual bonds are issued with call provisions that let issuers make repayments after a designated time period. In this regard, the \u201cperpetual\u201d part of the package is often a choice, rather than a mandate, because issuers can effectively squash the perpetual obligation if they have enough cash on hand to repay the loan in full. Perpetual bonds are of interest to investors because they offer steady, predictable sources of income, with payments made on a set schedule. Furthermore, some perpetual bonds boast \u201cstep-up\u201d features that increase the interest payment at predetermined points in the future. Technically referred to as \u201cgrowing perpetuity,\u201d\u00a0this function can be quite lucrative for investors. For example, perpetual bonds may increase their yield by 1% after 10 years. They may similarly offer periodic interest rate increases. Therefore, investors should pay close attention to any step-up provisions, when comparison-shopping for different perpetual bond offerings. Steady, predictable source of income with payments on a set schedule Some perpetual bonds increase interest at predetermined points in the future Investors are subject to perpetual credit risk exposure Issuers may be able to recall some perpetual bonds Rising general interest rates could diminish the value of the perpetual bond There are risks associated with perpetual bonds. Notably, they subject investors to perpetual credit risk exposure, because as time progresses, both governmental and corporate bond issuers can encounter financial troubles, and theoretically even shut down. Perpetual bonds may also be subject to call risk, which means that issuers can recall them. Finally, there is the ever-present risk of the general interest rates rising over time. In such cases where the perpetual bond\u2019s locked in interest is significantly lower than the current interest rate, investors could earn more money by holding a different bond. However, to swap out an old perpetual bond for a newer, higher interest bond, the investor must sell their existing bond on the open market, at which time it may be worth less than the purchase price because investors discount their offers based on the interest rate differential. If perpetual bonds have sparked your interest, there are copious opportunities to fold them into your investment portfolio, including overseas offerings in markets such as India, China, and the Philippines. A quick online search can easily refer you to such investments, like those issued by Ayala Corporation, Agile Property Holdings and Reliance Industries. Investors may also consult with brokers, who can furnish lists of offerings, and highlight the pros and cons of specific securities.

            "title": "Debentures vs. Fixed Deposits: What\u2019s the Difference?",
            "content": "Debentures and fixed deposits are two different ways of investing money through relatively low-risk financial instruments. A\u00a0debenture\u00a0is an unsecured bond. Essentially, it is a bond that is not backed by a physical asset or\u00a0collateral. A fixed deposit is an arrangement with a bank where a depositor places money into the bank for a fixed time period and receives a regular, fixed-interest profit. A debenture is a type of bond. However, the term debenture only applies to an unsecured bond. Therefore, all debentures can be bonds, but not all bonds are debentures. In business or corporate financing, unsecured debentures are typically riskier requiring the payment of higher coupons. Companies often favor issuing secured bonds because they can pay a lower coupon rate. An unsecured corporate bond issued from Apple would be an example of a debenture. A corporate mortgage bond issued to a select group of creditors that includes a collateralized provision for the property would be an example of a secured bond not considered a debenture. Sometimes, debentures are issued with provisions that allow the holder to exchange the debenture for company stock. Nonconvertible debentures are unsecured bonds that cannot be converted to company\u00a0equity\u00a0or stock. Nonconvertible debentures usually have higher interest rates than\u00a0convertible debentures. All debentures have specific features. First, a\u00a0trust indenture\u00a0is drafted, which is an agreement between the issuing corporation and the trust that manages the interest of the investors. Next, the\u00a0coupon rate\u00a0is decided, which is the rate of interest that the company will pay the debenture holder or investor. This rate can be either fixed or floating\u00a0depending\u00a0on the company's\u00a0credit rating\u00a0or the bond's credit rating. Debentures are issued through brokers, investment banks, and syndicates. Fixed deposits are a type of product offered through a bank. For debentures, the\u00a0date of maturity\u00a0is also an important feature. This date dictates when the issuing company must pay back the debenture holders. The most common form of repayment is called a\u00a0redemption\u00a0out of capital. Through this redemption, the issuing company makes a lump sum payment on the date of maturity. A substantial portion of the bonds traded on standard bond platforms is debentures. Thus, debentures can be easier to invest in than secured bonds. Many secured bonds are issued to a select group of investing creditors. Some secured bonds may also be bought through brokerage platforms, but many require a full-service broker. A fixed deposit, also known as a time deposit, is a type of product offered through banks. When a depositor places money in a fixed\u00a0deposit,\u00a0the amount of profit or interest paid on the investment is fixed. The rate will not increase or decrease at any time regardless of fluctuations in\u00a0interest rates. The interest rate offered by fixed deposits is usually set by prevailing low-risk market standards like the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or Treasury rate. Fixed deposits can have\u00a0maturities\u00a0from one week to ten years. Fixed deposits cannot be redeemed early. In other words, money cannot be withdrawn for any reason until the time-duration on the deposit has expired. If money is withdrawn early, then the bank can charge an\u00a0early withdrawal\u00a0penalty or fee. A very common example of a fixed deposit account is a\u00a0certificate of deposit\u00a0(CD). Both individual investors and businesses may choose to invest in fixed deposit products. For retail investors, fixed deposit CDs are offered by many different banking institutions. For companies, the negotiation and investment account procedures will typically vary and usually include special provisions specific to the business\u2019 needs. Debentures and fixed deposits have several key differences. Debentures can only be issued by businesses or governments, and are used to raise capital. An investor investing in a debenture should understand the issuer's specific risks. Investing in a fixed deposit can be done by both individuals and institutions. Investing in a fixed deposit involves understanding the provisions of the product but does not typically involve a high risk associated with the activities of the offering bank as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures most fixed deposits. Issued by governments and businesses to raise capital. Relatively high risk, since debentures are unsecured. Interest rate can be fixed or floating. Issued by banks to depositors. Low risk; most fixed deposits are insured by FDIC. Has a fixed interest rate. A debenture is a type of debt instrument that is not secured by any collateral, and usually has a lifetime of more than 10 years. A debt is any type of loan that must be repaid, whether or not it is backed by an asset. All debentures are debts, but not all debts are debentures. A time deposit is a type of bank account where money can be deposited for a fixed period of time, in exchange for a fixed interest rate. If the customer withdraws their funds before the account matures, they suffer a penalty. A certificate of deposit is one of the best-known types of time deposits, and the terms are often used interchangeably. A certificate of deposit provides a fixed interest rate, in exchange for a deposit that cannot be withdrawn before the account matures. The main advantage is that these instruments provide a higher interest rate than ordinary savings accounts. This higher rate is meant to compensate investors for the opportunity cost of their investment. Debentures and fixed deposits are both relatively low-risk investments. A fixed deposit is a type of fixed-interest account issued by banks, while debentures are unsecured debt instruments issued by a government or corporation. Because banks are insured by the FDIC, fixed deposits tend to be much less risky than debentures. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \"Deposit Insurance.\""

He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). A convertible debenture is a type of long-term debt issued by a company that can be converted into shares of equity stock after a specified period. Convertible debentures are usually unsecured bonds or loans, often with no underlying collateral backing up the debt. These long-term debt securities pay interest returns to the bondholder like any other bond. The unique feature of convertible debentures is that they are exchangeable for stock at specified times. This feature gives the bondholder some security that may offset some of the risks involved with investing in unsecured debt. A convertible debenture differs from convertible notes or convertible bonds, generally in that debentures have longer maturities. Typically, companies raise capital by issuing debt, in the form of bonds, or equity, in the form of shares of stock. Some companies may use more debt than equity to raise capital to fund operations or vice versa. A convertible debenture is a type of hybrid security with characteristics of both debt and equity instruments. Companies issue convertible debentures as fixed-rate loans, paying the bondholder fixed interest payments on a regular schedule. Bondholders have the option of holding the bond until maturity\u2014at which point they receive the return of their principal\u2014but, holders may also convert the debentures into stock. The debenture can typically only be converted into stock after a predetermined time, as specified in the bond's offering. A convertible debenture will usually return a lower interest rate since the debt holder has the option to convert the loan to stock, which is to the investors' benefit. Investors are thus willing to accept a lower rate of interest in exchange for the embedded option to convert into common shares. Convertible debentures therefore allow investors to participate in share price appreciation. The number of shares a bondholder receives for each debenture is determined at the time of issue based on a conversion ratio. For example, the company might distribute 10 shares of stock for each debenture with a face value of $1,000, which is a 10:1 conversion ratio. The convertible debt feature is factored into the calculation of the diluted per-share metrics of the stock. The conversion will increase the share count\u2014number of shares available\u2014and reduces metrics such as earnings per share (EPS). Another consideration for investing in unsecured debentures is that in the case of bankruptcy and liquidation they receive payment only after other fixed-income holders. Just as there are convertible debentures, there are also non-convertible debentures whereby the debt cannot be converted into equity. As a result, non-convertible debentures will offer higher interest rates than their convertible counterparts since investors do not have the option to convert to stock. Partly-convertible debentures are also a version of this type of debt. These loans have a predetermined portion that can be converted to stock. The conversion ratio is determined at the onset of the debt issuance. Fully-convertible debentures have the option to convert all of the debt into equity shares based on the terms outlined at the debt issuance. It's important that investors research the type of debenture they're considering for investment including if or when there is a conversion option, the conversion ratio, and the time frame for when a conversion to equity can occur. As with any fixed-income instrument, whether it is a bond or loan the debt it represents ultimately needs to be repaid. Too much debt on a company's balance sheet can lead to high debt-servicing costs that include interest payments. As a result, companies with debt can have volatile earnings. Equity, unlike debentures, does not require repayment, nor does it require the payment of interest to holders. However, a company might pay dividends to shareholders, which although voluntary, could be seen as a cost of issuing equity since the firm's retained earnings or accumulated profits would be reduced. Convertible debentures are hybrid products that try to strike a balance between debt and equity. Investors gain the benefit of fixed interest payments while also having the option to convert the loan to equity if the company performs well, rising stock prices over time. The risk to investors is that there is little insurance in case of default if they're holding shares of common stock. However, during bankruptcy liquidation, if an investor is holding a convertible debenture, the debenture holder gets paid before common shareholders. Investors are paid a fixed-rate while having the option to participate in a stock price increase. If the issuer's stock price declines, investors can hold the bond until maturity and collect interest income. Convertible bondholders are paid before stockholders in the event of a company's liquidation. Investors receive a lower interest rate compared to traditional bonds in exchange for the option to convert to stock. Investors could lose money if the stock price declines following the conversion from a bond to equity. Bondholders are at risk of the company defaulting and being unable to pay back the principal. Assume Pear Inc. wants to expand internationally for the first time to sell its mobile products and services. Investors are unsure if the products will sell abroad and whether the company's international business plan will work. The company issues convertible debentures to attract enough investors to fund their international expansion. The conversion will be at a ratio of 20:1 after three years. The fixed interest rate paid to investors on the convertible debenture is 2%, which is lower than the typical bond rate. However, the lower rate is the trade-off for the right to convert the debentures into stock. After three years, the international expansion is a hit, and the company's stock price takes off rising from $20 to $100 per share. Holders of the convertible debentures can convert their debt into stock at the 20:1 conversion ratio. Investors with one debenture can convert their debt into $2,000 worth of stock (20 x $100 per share). The international expansion fails. Investors can hold on to their convertible debentures and continue to receive fixed interest payments at the rate of 2% per year until the debt matures and the company returns their principal. In this example, Pear got the benefit of a low-interest-rate loan by issuing the convertible debenture. However, if the expansion does well, the company's equity shares would get diluted as investors convert their debentures to stock. This increase in the number of shares would result in a diluted earnings-per-share."

            "content": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). The credit market is the market through which companies and governments issue debt to investors, such as investment-grade bonds, junk bonds, and short-term commercial paper. Sometimes called the debt market, the credit market also includes debt offerings, such as notes and securitized obligations, including collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), mortgage-backed securities, and credit default swaps (CDS). The credit market dwarfs the equity market in terms of dollar value. As such, the state of the credit market acts as an indicator of the relative health of the markets and the economy as a whole. Some analysts refer to the credit market as the canary in the mine because the credit market typically shows signs of distress before the equity market. The government is the largest debt issuer, issuing Treasury bills, notes, and bonds, with maturity durations of anywhere from one month to 30 years. Corporations also issue corporate bonds, the second-largest portion of the credit market. Through corporate bonds, investors lend corporations money they can use to expand their business. In return, the company pays the holder an interest fee and repays the principal at the end of the term.\u00a0Municipalities and government agencies may issue bonds, which are used to fund projects and programs. For example, a municipality bond may be issued to support a city housing project. In an economy, there are generally two types of credit markets; formal and informal. An informal credit market is one that a government does not control. A formal credit market is controlled by a government, which is most common in developed countries. In developed countries with regulated credit markets, corporations, national governments, and municipalities can issue bonds when they need funding. Investors who buy the bonds essentially loan the issuer money. In turn, the issuer pays the investors interest on the bonds, and when the bonds mature, the investors sell them back to the issuers at face value. However, investors may also sell their bonds to other investors for more or less than their face values prior to maturity. Other parts of the credit market are slightly more complicated, and they consist of consumer debt, such as mortgages, credit cards, and car loans bundled together and sold as an investment. As payments are received on the bundled debt, the buyer earns interest on the security, but if too many borrowers (in the bundled pool) default on their loans, the buyer loses. While the credit market gives investors a chance to invest in corporate or consumer debt, the equity market offers investors a chance to invest in a company's equity. For example, if an investor buys a bond from a company, they are lending the company money and investing in the credit market. If they buy a stock, they are purchasing a share of the company itself. Depending on the type of stock and what the company grants to investors, this means that they can take part in its profits, assume a share of its losses, or experience increases or decreases in the company's market value. In 2017, Apple Inc (AAPL) issued $2 billion in bonds that mature in 2027. The bonds pay a coupon of 2.9%, with payments twice per year. The bond has a $1,000 face value, payable at maturity. An investor looking to receive steady income could buy the bonds\u2014assuming they believe Apple will be able to afford the interest payments through to 2027 and pay the face value at maturity. At the time of the issue, Apple had a high credit rating. The investor can buy and sell the bonds anytime, as they are not required to hold them until maturity. Between the Sep. 12, 2017 issue date and Aug. 10, 2023, the bonds had a bond quote ranging from $92.69 in October 2018 to $113.65 in July 2020. They then declined in price to hover between $91.53 October 2022 and $96.39 in April 2023. This means the bondholder could have received the coupon but also seen their bond value increase if they bought at the lower end of the range. People buying near the top of the range would have seen their bonds fall in value but still received the coupon. Bond prices rise and fall due to company-related risk; however, they primarily fluctuate because of changes in interest rates in the economy. If interest rates rise, the lower fixed coupon becomes less attractive, and the bond price falls. If interest rates decline, the higher fixed coupon becomes more attractive, and the bond price rises. Prevailing interest rates and investor demand are both indicators of the health of the credit market. Analysts also look at the spread between the interest rates on Treasury and corporate bonds, including investment-grade and junk bonds. Treasury bonds have the lowest default risk and, thus, the lowest interest rates, while corporate bonds have more default risk and higher interest rates. As the spread between the interest rates on those types of investments increases, it can foreshadow a recession as investors begin to view corporate bonds as increasingly risky. The credit market plays a vital role in a country's economy. It is a market where governments, corporations, or other entities can issue bonds in exchange for capital to fund projects or programs. Debt market is another term used to refer to the credit market, so they are the same. There are generally two kinds of credit markets in an economy. One is a formal credit market regulated by the government, and the other is informal, which means it is not regulated. A credit market is a market where investors, entities, or individuals can make loans to others in return for interest or other compensation. Developed economies such as the U.S. generally have formal credit markets, which are regulated. Governments, municipalities, and corporations can use the credit market to issue bonds in exchange for capital from investors to fund projects or programs. The investors are usually incentivized with interest payments or a promise of an increased value when the bond matures.

            "title": "Step-Up Bond: Definition, How It Works, Pros & Cons, Example",
            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. A step-up bond is a bond that pays a lower initial interest rate but includes a feature that allows for rate increases at periodic intervals. The number and extent of the rate increase, as well as the timing, depends on the terms of the bond.\u00a0A step-up bond provides investors with the benefits of fixed-income securities while keeping up with rising interest rates. However, the initial rate offered on a step-up bond could be lower than the rates offered in other fixed-income investments. Although there are many benefits to step-up bonds, investors should also be aware of the inherent risks associated with these debt securities. Bonds are debt instrument securities or IOUs that corporations and government agencies issue to investors to raise funds for a project or an expansion. Typically, the investor pays for the bond upfront for its face value amount, which could be $1,000 each. The investor would get repaid the $1,000 (called the principal amount), when the bond matures, (called the maturity date). Most bonds pay a periodic interest rate, (called a coupon rate), that's typically fixed over the life of the bond. For example, if an investor buys a $1,000 Treasury bond with a rate of 2%\u2013maturing in ten years\u2013the investor would be paid interest payments based on the 2% coupon rate. The investor would be repaid the $1,000 principal when the bond matures\u2013or in ten years. Conversely, a step-up bond pays a lower rate in the early years, and its rate increases over time so that investors receive a higher coupon rate as the maturity date approaches. For example, a five-year step-up bond might have an initial rate of 2.5% for the first two years and a 4.5% coupon rate for the final three years. Because the coupon payment increases over the life of the bond, a step-up bond lets investors take advantage of the stability of bond interest payments while benefiting from increases in the coupon rate. However, as a result of the step-up feature, step-up bonds tend to have lower coupon rates initially, compared to other fixed-rate bonds. The structure of step-up bonds can have either single or multiple rate increases. Single step-up bonds, also known as one-step bonds, have one increase in the coupon rate during the life of the bond. Conversely, the multi-step-up bond can adjust the coupon upward several times within the life of the security. The coupon increases follow a predetermined schedule. Step-up bonds are similar to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). The principal of a TIPS increases with inflation and decreases with deflation. Inflation is the rate of price increases in the U.S. economy and is measured by the Consumer Price Index. TIPS pay interest semiannually, at a fixed rate, which is applied to the adjusted principal amount. As a result, the interest payment amounts rise with inflation and fall with deflation.\ufeff\ufeff Step-up bonds typically perform better than other fixed-rate investments in a rising-rate market. With each step, bondholders are paid a higher rate, and since there's less risk of losing out on higher market rates, step-ups have less price volatility or price fluctuations. It's important to remember that bond prices and interest rates are inversely related, meaning that when interest rates fall, bond prices increase. Conversely, rising interest rates tend to lead to a sell-off in the bond market, and bond prices fall. The reason for the sell-off is that existing fixed-rate bonds are less attractive in a rising-rate market. Investors typically demand higher-yielding bonds as rates rise and dump their lower-rate bonds. Step-up bonds help investors avoid this process since the rate of the bond increases over time. Step-up bonds sell on the secondary market and are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As a result, there are usually enough buyers and sellers in the market\u2013called liquidity\u2013allowing investors to enter and exit positions with ease. A step-up bond's interest payments increase over the life of the bond. The SEC regulates step-up bonds. Step-up bonds tend to have a low risk of default. The step-up feature reduces exposure to market rate and price volatility. Step-up bonds are very liquid. Higher rates are not guaranteed as some step-up bonds are callable. Interest rate risk exists: Market rates can rise faster than the step-up rates. Noncallable step-ups pay lower coupon rates since there's no risk of early redemption. Step-ups sold early could incur a loss if the sale price is less than the purchase price. On the downside, some step-up bonds are callable, meaning the issuer can redeem the bond. The callable feature will be triggered when it benefits the issuer meaning if market rates fall, the investor has a chance of the bond's issuer calling back the security. If the bond is recalled, it will be unlikely that the investor will be able to reinvest at the same rate received from the step-up bond.\u00a0Also, if the investor purchases a new bond, the price will likely be different from the original purchase price of the step-up bond. Although step-up bonds increase at set intervals in a rising-rate environment, they can still miss out on higher interest rates. If market rates are rising at a faster rate than the step-up increases, the bondholder will experience interest rate risk. Also, the investor may have an opportunity cost and reinvestment risk if the step-up bond is paying a lower-than-market rate versus other bonds available. Step-up bonds are usually issued by high-quality corporations and government agencies, which helps to reduce the risk of default, which is the failure to repay the principal and interest. Bond prices fluctuate periodically. If a step-up bond is sold before its maturity date, the price the investor receives could be lower than the original purchase price leading to a loss. The investor is only guaranteed the principal amount being returned if the bond is held to maturity. Let's say Apple Inc. (AAPL) offers investors a step-up bond with a five-year maturity. The coupon rate or interest rate is 3% for the first two years and steps up to 4.5% in the following three years. Shortly after purchasing the bond, let's say overall interest rates rise to 3.5% in the economy after the first year. The step-up bond would have a lower rate of return at 3% versus the overall market. In year three, interest rates fall to 2.4% due to the Federal Reserve signaling it'll keep market interest rates low to boost the economy for the next few years. The step-up bond would have a higher rate at 4.5% versus the overall market or typical fixed-income securities. However, if interest rates rose during the life of the step-up bond and consistently exceeded the coupon rate, the bond's return would be lower relative to the overall market.

            "title": "Catastrophe Bond (CAT) Meaning, Benefits, Risk, Example",
            "content": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). A catastrophe bond (CAT) is a high-yield debt instrument that is designed to raise money for companies in the insurance industry in the event of a natural disaster. A CAT bond allows the issuer to receive funding from the bond only if specific conditions, such as an earthquake or tornado, occur. If an event protected by the bond activates a payout to the insurance company, the obligation to pay interest and repay the principal is either deferred or completely forgiven. CAT bonds have short maturity dates of between three-to-five years. The primary investors in these securities are hedge funds, pension funds, and other institutional investors. Catastrophe bonds are used by property and casualty insurers as well as reinsurance companies to transfer risk to investors. First marketed in the 1990s, these bonds offer insurance and reinsurance companies another way of offsetting the risk associated with underwriting policies. Institutional investors can receive a higher interest rate from CAT bonds than from most other fixed-income securities. CAT bonds are a type of insurance-linked security (ILS)\u2014an umbrella term for financial securities that are linked to pre-specified events or insurance-related risks. CAT bonds are paid to insurance companies only if a catastrophe\u2014that is protected by the bond\u2014occurs. When CAT bonds are issued, the proceeds raised from investors go into a secure collateral account, where they may be invested in various other low-risk securities. Interest payments to investors come from the secure collateral account. A CAT bond might be structured so that the payout occurs only if the total natural disaster costs exceed a specific dollar amount over the specified coverage period. Bonds also can be pegged to the strength of a storm or earthquake, or to the number of events, such as more than five named hurricanes striking Texas. A series of natural disasters would trigger a payout to the insurance company, which funds also would come from the secure collateral account. Investors would lose their principal if the costs of the covered natural disasters exceed the total dollar amount raised from the bond issuance. However, if the costs to cover the disaster do not exceed the specified amount during the bond's lifetime, investors would get their principal returned at the bond's maturity. The investor also would benefit from receiving the regular interest payments in return for holding the bond. The interest rates paid by CAT bonds are not usually linked to the financial markets or economic conditions. In this way, CAT bonds offer investors stable interest payments even when interest rates are low and traditional bonds are offering lower yields. Further, institutional investors may use CAT bonds to help diversify a portfolio to protect against economic and market risk. The reason for this potentially reduced risk is that these investments do not necessarily correlate to economic performance or stock market moves. CAT bonds offer a competitive yield compared to other fixed-income bonds and dividend-paying stocks. Investors in CAT bonds receive fixed interest payments over the life of the bond. Also, because these bonds' maturities are typically short-term, there is less probability that an event triggering payout would occur. CAT bonds benefit the insurance industry because the capital raised lowers their out-of-pocket costs for natural disaster coverage. CAT bonds also provide insurance companies with cash when they need it the most, which could prevent them from needing to file for bankruptcy because of a natural disaster. Although CAT bonds can reduce risk to insurance companies, the risk is borne by the buyers of the securities. The risk of losing the principal amount invested is mitigated somewhat by the short maturity of the bonds. According to the Insurance Information Institute, in 2019 overall losses from world-wide natural catastrophes totaled $150 billion dollars, which was roughly in line with the inflation-adjusted average of the past-30 years, and down from $186 billion in 2018. In 2019, 820 events caused losses, compared with 850 events in 2018. Insured losses from the 2019 events totaled $52 billion, down from $86 billion in 2018. So, although overall losses were down in 2019 versus 2018, the costs from damages can run into the billions of dollars, and investors holding CAT bonds are at risk of losing all or part of their investment. Investors need to weigh the risks versus the returns of the attractive yields offered by CAT bonds. CAT bonds can offer diversification from economic and market risk because natural disasters don't usually correlate with economic events and stock market movements. However, there could be exceptions if a natural disaster were to cause a recession and subsequently a stock market decline. Investors holding CAT bonds would be at risk of losing their principal if the disastrous event spurred a payment to the insurance company. However, if the catastrophic event occurred during a recession, the consequences could be compounded if some of the investors also lost their sources of income (jobs) concurrent with losing their investment in the CAT bond. CAT bonds can offer investors stable, high-yield interest payments over the life of the bond. CAT bonds can help to hedge a portfolio against certain types of risk, as natural disasters don't correlate to stock market moves. CAT bonds have short maturities of one-to-five years, which reduces the likelihood of a payout to the insurance company, including loss of principal. CAT bonds can risk of losing the principal amount invested if payment to the insurance company occurs. Natural disasters can occur during stock market declines and recessions, which in turn could negate the diversification benefit of CAT bonds. The short-term maturities of CAT bonds might not lessen the probability of a triggering event if the frequency and costs of natural disasters increases. Let's say that State Farm Insurance, one of the largest mutual insurance companies in the United States, issues a CAT bond. The bond has a $1,000 face value, matures in two years, and pays an annual interest rate of 6.5%. An investor who buys the CAT bond will receive $65 each year and the principal will be returned at maturity. Issuance of the CAT bond raised $100 million in proceeds, which was placed in a special account."

            "title": "What Is a Sukuk? Sharia-Compliant Bond-Like Financial Instruments",
            "content": "Investopedia / Ellen Lindner A sukuk is an Islamic financial certificate, similar to a bond in Western finance, that complies with Islamic religious law commonly known as Sharia. Since the traditional Western interest-paying bond structure is not permissible, the issuer of a sukuk essentially sells an investor group a certificate, and then uses the proceeds to purchase an asset that the investor group has direct partial ownership interest in. The issuer must also make a contractual promise to buy back the bond at a future date at par value. With the rise of Islamic finance, sukuk have become extremely popular since 2000, when the first such products were issued in Malaysia. Bahrain followed suit in 2001. Fast forward to current times, and sukuk are used by Islamic corporations and state-run organizations alike around the globe, taking up an increasing share of the global fixed-income market. Islamic law prohibits what's known as \"riba,\" or what we understand as \"interest\" in the West. Therefore, traditional, Western debt instruments cannot be used as viable investment vehicles or ways to raise capital for a business. To circumvent this, sukuk were created in order to link the returns and cash flows of debt financing to a specific asset being purchased, effectively distributing the benefits of that asset. This allows investors to work around the prohibition outlined under Sharia and still receive the benefits of debt financing. However, because of the way that sukuk are structured, financing can only be raised for identifiable assets. Thus, sukuk represent aggregate and undivided shares of ownership in a tangible asset as it relates to a specific project or a specific investment activity. An investor in a sukuk, therefore, does not own a debt obligation owed by the bond issuer, but instead owns a piece of the asset that's linked to the investment. This means that sukuk holders, unlike bond holders, receive a portion of the earnings generated by the associated asset. Sukuk and conventional bonds do share similar characteristics, but also have important key differences: Both provide investors with payment streams. Bonds and sukuk are issued to investors and may be used to raise capital for a firm. Both are considered to be safer investments than equities.  Sukuk investors receive profit generated by the underlying asset on a periodic basis while bond investors receive periodic interest payments. Sukuk involves asset ownership while bonds are debt obligations. If the asset backing a sukuk appreciates then the sukuk can appreciate whereas bond yield is strictly due to its interest rate. Assets that back sukuk are halal whereas bonds are often riba and may finance non sharia compliant businesses or fuel speculation. Sukuk valuation is based on the value of the assets backing them while a bond's price is largely determined by its credit rating. The most common type of a sukuk comes in the form of a trust certificate. These certificates are also governed by Western law, however, the structure of this type of sukuk is more nuanced. The organization raising funds first creates an offshore special purpose vehicle (SPV). The SPV then issues trust certificates to qualified investors and puts the proceeds of the investments toward a funding agreement with the issuing organization. In return, the investors earn a portion of the profits linked to the asset. Sukuk structured as trust certificates are only applicable if the SPV can be created in an offshore jurisdiction that allows such trusts. This is sometimes not possible. If an SPV and trust certificates can't be created, a sukuk can be structured as an alternative civil-law structure. In this scenario, an asset-leasing company is created in the country of origin, effectively purchasing the asset and leasing it back to the organization in need of financing.

            "title": "Mumbai Interbank Offer Rate (MIBOR): Definition, vs. MIBID",
            "content": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University. The Mumbai Interbank Offer Rate (MIBOR) was the rate at which banks in India wanted to charge other banks to lend them money. It was used in conjunction with the Mumbai Interbank Bid (MIBID) rate, which was the rate banks wanted to pay to borrow money. The MIBOR was the Indian version of the London Intrabank Offer Rate and was fixed for funds that ranged from overnight to three months. Banks borrow and lend money to one another on the interbank market\u00a0to maintain appropriate legal\u00a0liquidity levels and to meet\u00a0reserve requirements placed on them by regulators. Interbank lending rates are made available only to the largest and most creditworthy financial institutions. MIBOR was the asking rate for overnight to three-month loans, calculated every day by the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) as a weighted average of proposed lending rates. Data was gathered by polling 30 major banks throughout India on the rates they intended to use to lend funds to their most trusted borrowers. The MIBOR was launched on June 15, 1998, by the Indian National Stock Exchange (NSE) Committee for the Development of the Debt Market as a benchmark for the call money market. The NSE launched the 14-day MIBOR on November 10, 1998, and the one-month and three-month MIBORs on December 1, 1998. Between 1998 and 2015, MIBOR rates were used as benchmark rates for the majority of money market deals made in India. In 2015, it was decided that polled respondents could too easily manipulate MIBOR by exaggerating their rate estimates for profitability purposes. The latest version of MIBOR is the Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd (FBIL) Overnight Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate (FBIL-Overnight MIBOR), which is based on actual transaction rates, and includes a maximum and minimum rate. Originally, MIBOR was the rate that banks wanted to be paid for overnight loans. In 2015, it was replaced by the FBIL-Overnight MIBOR due to concerns that the banks polled could easily falsify the rates they claimed they were going to charge. The new MIBOR is based on observable rates, so there is no question of whether the rate estimations are accurate or honest. The Mumbai Interbank Bid Rate (MIBID) was the companion rate to the original MIBOR in that it was the rate at which banks wanted to pay for a loan. It was lower than the MIBOR rate, which created a bid/ask spread between the two rates. MIBID was also discontinued in 2015. Instead of using two rates created by polling banks, the FBIL-Overnight MIBOR is a range of rates calculated by observing transactions between banks rather than asking them what rates they would charge and ask. Interbank offered rates are interest rates charged between banks on overnight loans. These rates are important because they are considered risk-free rates many other rates are based on. The Mumbai Interbank Forward Offer Rate was the rate used to set prices on forward-rate agreements and derivatives in India before it was discontinued in 2018. The London Intrabank Offered Rate (LIBOR) was set by submissions from a panel of banks in the U.K. and was used by several countries. LIBOR was replaced by the Secured Overnite Financing Rate (SOFR). The original Mumbai Intrabank Overnight Rate was India's version of LIBOR and was set based on polls from 30 banks and dealers in India, but it was replaced in 2015 by the FBIL-Overnight MIBOR. The Mumbai Intrabank Offered Rate was the overnight rate banks charged each other for loans in India. It was used in conjunction with MIBID to create a rate spread for banks. Rates were derived by polling specific banks and dealers, who could influence rates based on the probability of profitability. It was replaced in 2015 by the FBIL-Overnight MIBOR, which is a rate range calculated using the weighted averages of transactions occurring in the Indian market.

            "content": "Investopedia / Tara Anand Treasury ETFs offer a convenient way to gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of Treasurys without the need to manage individual securities. Treasury exchange-traded funds (ETFs) trade like stocks on the major exchanges. They hold a portfolio of U.S. Treasury securities, with each ETF differing in time to maturity from less than a year up to 30 years. First introduced in the early 2000s, they have grown in popularity, and there are now more than 50 of them to choose from. Typically not as exciting as other securities, Treasury securities\u2019 swings have meant that those seeking to lower the overall risk of their portfolio might want this part of their holdings managed professionally. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, substantial changes in interest rates have happened worldwide, with the United States being a prime example. The overall shift can be seen in the moves of the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, which hit a record low of 0.33% in March 2020, then surged to a high of 5.02% in October 2023, before settling to around 4.5% in early 2024. These dramatic changes came from disruptions in the supply chain, persistently high post-pandemic inflation, and most significantly, the ratcheting-up of interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Treasury ETFs stand out for their lower costs than other ETFs, tax efficiency, and exposure to varying lengths of maturity and bond coupons. Treasury ETFs present minimal risk, making them an attractive choice for those navigating the evolving interest rate landscape. Treasury ETFs are designed to track the performance of Treasurys, including short-, intermediate-, and long-term maturities of Treasury bills (maturity of a year or less), notes (one to 10 years), and bonds (20 or 30 years). They provide investors with an efficient and convenient way to gain exposure to U.S. government debt with the convenience of doing so from a brokerage account. Investors typically use Treasury ETFs for income generation, capital preservation, and portfolio diversification. They are particularly popular among conservative investors and those seeking a stable, government-backed income stream. More aggressive investors tend to use Treasury ETFs to speculate on changes in interest rates. Like all investments, they are not without risks, particularly interest rate and inflation risks. U.S. Treasurys are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, making them just about the safest investment option available. Low-risk and traded like stocks, Treasury ETFs are also highly liquid. This means you can buy and sell shares of the ETF throughout the trading day at market prices, providing the flexibility you wouldn\u2019t have if you bought the Treasurys yourself. It\u2019s important to understand how U.S. Treasurys are priced, since their value depends heavily on changes in interest rates. In general, as interest rates rise, existing bonds tend to decrease in value, and conversely, as rates fall, bond values increase. This affects Treasury ETFs and the aggregate value of the U.S. Treasury they hold, so understanding how interest rates influence them is important to know. Treasury ETFs are also valued for how they diversify investment portfolios. Given their historically low correlation with stocks and other asset classes, they can serve as a hedge against market volatility or economic downturns. This makes them attractive for lowering the overall risk of a portfolio. It\u2019s important to note that Treasury ETFs are fixed-income instruments. They come with differing yields and durations, depending on the maturities of the bonds they hold. Short-term Treasury ETFs are typically less sensitive to changes in interest rates and offer lower yields, while long-term Treasury ETFs are more sensitive to interest rate fluctuations but usually have higher yields. This means you can choose the ETF containing the Treasurys that best match your investment horizon, financial goals, and risk tolerance. ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, like individual stocks. They combine the diversification offered by mutual funds with the liquidity and ease of trading of a stock. The key, of course, is that these ETFs hold U.S. Treasurys, which are debt instruments issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. These include Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. Most Treasury ETFs are passively managed and are designed to track the performance of a particular Treasury bond index. Each index has its criteria, such as the maturities and the type of Treasurys included. Treasury ETFs have large institutional investors, known as authorized participants, that can create new shares of an ETF or redeem them. This is done by delivering the underlying securities to the fund in exchange for ETF shares (creation) or vice versa (redemption). This helps to keep the ETF\u2019s market price close to its net asset value. Though traded on exchanges like stocks, Treasury ETFs do not pay dividends. Instead, they pay interest income, called distributions, from the underlying Treasury securities. Distributions are usually done monthly and can vary depending on interest payments received from the Treasurys in the ETF\u2019s portfolio. Like other ETFs, Treasury ETFs charge a fee for managing the fund. This is called the expense ratio and is typically lower than that of actively managed funds. In the United Kingdom, India, and other commonwealths, the equivalent of a U.S. Treasury security is a gilt security. These trade through gilt ETFs and mutual funds. Treasury ETFs can cater to different investment strategies and risk profiles. Some short-term Treasury ETFs put money into Treasury securities with less time to maturity\u2014generally, less than three years. There are intermediate-term Treasury ETFs, which invest in Treasurys with maturities from three to 10 years. Long-term Treasury ETFs hold securities with maturities greater than 10 years. Another category of Treasury ETFs is for those that hold Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS). The principal value of TIPS adjusts with inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. There are also floating-rate Treasury ETFs. These ETFs put money into Treasury floating rate notes (FRNs), whose interest adjusts according to short-term interest rates. These offer protection when interest rates rise (and existing bond values decline). The last funds we review are zero-coupon Treasury ETFs, which invest in Treasury STRIPS (an acronym for separate trading of registered interest and principal of securities). These are zero-coupon bonds created by separating the interest and principal of Treasury notes and bonds. They are bought at a discount and mature at face value, with the difference representing the interest earned. As with any other investment, you\u2019ll want to review how a Treasury ETF fits with your goals and risk tolerance. Initially, you\u2019ll need to assess the broader economic environment and monetary policy of the U.S. This can significantly influence Treasury securities. Another factor to consider for Treasury ETFs and fixed-income investments in general is interest rates. When rates rise, the value of existing bonds tends to fall, and vice versa. Treasury ETFs hold a portfolio of U.S. Treasurys, and thus the value of these ETFs comes from the aggregate of all the Treasurys in their portfolios. Also, longer-duration ETFs are generally more sensitive to interest rate changes than shorter-duration ETFs. The duration and maturity of the Treasury securities in the ETF should also be considered. Short-term Treasury ETFs are less sensitive to interest rate changes but typically offer lower yields, while long-term Treasury ETFs are more sensitive but often have higher yields. Investors should also assess the yield of the Treasury ETF, which depends on the underlying securities\u2019 maturities and current interest rates. Higher yields often come with more risk. You should check the trading volume and liquidity of any Treasury ETFs you consider. This means that an ETF\u2019s shares are easier to buy and sell without affecting the price. You should also review each ETF\u2019s expense ratio. A lower expense ratio can be more cost-effective, especially for long-term investments, though a badly managed ETF will likely cost you more in the long run, no matter the fees. Treasury ETFs carry specific implications for your taxes, including interest income and potential capital gains. We discuss this further below. Accessibility Cost-effectiveness Credit quality Hedge against inflation Income Liquidity Tax efficiency Transparency Variety Interest rate risk Expense ratio Fiscal and monetary policy changes Market risks Opportunity costs Relatively low yield Tax considerations Tracking error There are several reasons why Treasury ETFs have grown in popularity: Treasury ETFs also have risks, so it\u2019s important to review how Treasury ETFs fit into your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. Here are some of their drawbacks: While Treasury ETFs offer safety and diversification, they should be part of a well-executed portfolio strategy rather than stand-alone investments. Buying shares of Treasury ETFs involves several simple steps. If you already invest in the stock market, you\u2019re halfway there. First, before placing an order, evaluate your financial goals, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. How does a Treasury ETF fit into your overall portfolio strategy? Next, research Treasury ETFs and review their maturity profile, yield, expense ratio, and performance history. If you\u2019re a first-time investor, you\u2019ll open a brokerage account next. Choose a reputable broker that aligns with your needs, considering trading fees, platform usability, and available research tools. Once you\u2019ve selected a brokerage and opened an account, you\u2019ll need to put funds into it. Following this, based on your research and investment goals, choose a Treasury ETF that meets your criteria. Here are some questions to ask: Once you\u2019ve chosen one, you\u2019ll buy shares in the ETF. But this doesn\u2019t end the investing process\u2014in a sense, it\u2019s just starting. You\u2019ll have to check the performance of the securities as part of your overall portfolio. You\u2019ll look for changes in economic conditions, interest rates, and other factors affecting the ETF\u2019s performance. You should also review your entire portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Shift your investments when needed. Investing in Treasury ETFs can be worthwhile for diversifying most portfolios, offering safety, income, and liquidity. However, like all investments, it\u2019s essential to do your research or seek advice from a financial advisor to ensure any investment is right for you. The table below provides data on the top and largest Treasury ETFs by assets under management (AUM). The combined AUM of the top 10 Treasury ETFs is about $257 billion, with an average AUM of about $25.66 billion. This is a strong presence in the market, highlighting investor interest in these ETFs. The largest is the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), which has $48.48 billion in AUM. These ETFs are notably consistent in their fees. The average expense ratio is 0.11%, with the lowest\u2014the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF (VGSH)\u2014at 0.04%, and the highest\u2014the iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP)\u2014at 0.19%. The distribution yield varies from 2.69% for the iShares US Treasury Bond ETF (GOVT) to 4.91% for the SPDR Bloomberg 1\u20133 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL). The average distribution yield is 3.48%. The average yield to maturity (YTM) for these 10 Treasury ETFs spans from 3.90% to 5.36%, with the average at 4.54%. The lowest average YTM is for the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF (VGIT), while the highest is the iShares 0\u20133 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV). The maturity of the ETFs\u2019 basket of Treasurys can differ across these ETFs. The fund with the shortest weighted-average maturity, SGOV, is just 0.09 years. The longest, TLT, is 25.62 years. The average maturity for the list below is 5.86 years. Some Treasury ETFs focus on short-term U.S. Treasurys, including those with maturities of about one year. However, no ETF invests only in one-year Treasury securities. Instead, these ETFs typically include a range of Treasurys with maturities from a few months to a few years. Technically, Treasury ETFs do not pay dividends, since those are a share of company profits. Instead, Treasury ETFs pay interest income and, at times, capital gains on the underlying U.S. Treasurys through distributions. These are generally paid monthly. While Treasury ETFs are considered safe as a credit risk, they are not immune to market and interest rate risks. Investors should consider these in the context of their overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. An inverse Treasury ETF is designed to perform in the opposite direction of the moves of Treasury securities. Thus, these ETFs increase in value when Treasury bond prices fall and decrease in value when Treasury bond prices rise. Investors tend to use this ETF when expecting a decline in Treasury bond prices, often because interest rates are predicted to rise. Treasury ETFs offer investors exposure to U.S. Treasury securities, ranging from short-term bills to long-term bonds. There are also inflation-protected and floating-rate Treasury ETFs. These ETFs pool investors\u2019 money to purchase a portfolio of Treasurys, aiming to replicate the performance of specific bond indexes. Like stocks, they are traded on exchanges, combining the liquidity and ease of stock trading with the creditworthiness of the U.S. government. With their large variety of maturity profiles, yield potential, and sensitivity to interest rates, Treasury ETFs are a flexible and cost-effective tool for investors to manage risk, generate income, and diversify their portfolios.

            "title": "How to Rebalance Your Portfolio",
            "content": "Here's how to build a balanced portfolio to help manage risk and obtain your investing goals Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Like building a house, learning how to rebalance your portfolio begins with creating a sound foundation. First, define your financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. From this assessment, map out a mix of financial assets such as stock and bond ETFs with the help of a financial advisor or robo-advisor or on your own. You\u2019ll typically own a greater percentage of stock assets when you're younger, while more conservative investors will lean towards a larger allotment of cash and bond investments. We\u2019ve compiled the basics every investor should know and have structured this guide for rebalancing your portfolio so that it should answer the most critical questions. The goal in rebalancing your portfolio is not perfection, since as soon as your investments return to their predetermined percentages, prices will shift, causing the asset values to deviate. Rebalance your portfolio at least annually and consider these factors: There are several rebalancing strategies: First, track the asset allocation of your portfolio. You can maintain your records on a spreadsheet or use a free or paid investment monitor like Quicken or Mint. You're ready to proceed when your assets are listed and percent devoted to each asset class is recorded. Compare the current percent weights of each asset class with your predetermined asset allocation. Quicken or other tools can do this for you. Or use a spreadsheet to compare your current asset values with the desired percent. Notice the difference between your actual and preferred asset allocation.\u00a0If your 80% stock, 20% bond portfolio has drifted to 85% stocks and 15% bonds, then it\u2019s time to rebalance, either by adding new money or selling stocks and buying bonds. To sell 5% of your stock assets, you\u2019ll make a simple calculation. Assume your portfolio is worth $100,000 and your desired allocation is $80,000 in stock assets and $20,000 in bond assets. After the value drifts to $85,000 stocks and $15,000 bonds, you\u2019ll sell $5,000 worth of stock investments. With the $5,000 proceeds from the stock sale, you\u2019ll buy $5,000 of bonds. This will return your portfolio to its preferred 80% stock, 20% bond mix. Let\u2019s say that you want to add $10,000 to the portfolio. The value of your portfolio will be $110,000 with a desired asset mix of $88,000 in stock investments and $22,000 in bonds. (Multiply $110,000 by 80% for the stock allocation amount and multiply $110,000 by 20% to arrive at your dollar goal amount for the bond category). To rebalance a portfolio after adding additional cash, calculate the difference between the current value and the preferred value, for each asset class. Using our former example, we have $85,000 in stocks so we buy $3,000 of stocks, to reach the desired $88,000 stock allocation. Similarly, we buy $7,000 of the bond asset class to reach the desired $22,000 in bonds. Follow these steps every time you rebalance your portfolio and don\u2019t worry if the asset allocation drifts between your rebalancing periods. If your situation changes, and you become more conservative or more comfortable with greater volatility or risk, you can always adjust your desired asset allocation. A robo-advisor might be the best solution for those who prefer to outsource portfolio selection and rebalancing. Robo-advisors such as Wealthfront and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios are designed to offer investors access to well-diversified investment portfolios, rebalancing, and other features, such as tax loss harvesting, with low or no management fees. The most popular robo-advisors administer a quick survey to determine your investment goals, timeline, and risk. Ultimately, the survey results drive the investment portfolio. After investing, the top robo-advisors will rebalance your holdings on an as-needed basis, to keep your portfolio in line with the initial survey parameters. Investment management, which includes rebalancing, requires a commitment. You\u2019ll need to analyze your investments, to make certain they still meet your objectives. Periodically you\u2019ll review the asset allocation you\u2019ve selected and decide whether you\u2019re comfortable with the ups and downs of the financial markets. You might choose to increase the stock allocation if you\u2019re comfortable with greater risk, or increase the cash and bond portion if you\u2019re nearing retirement or uncomfortable with occasional double-digit declines in your investment values. Minimizes a portfolio's volatility and risk Improves a portfolio's diversification With a planned rebalancing schedule, you\u2019re less likely to become spooked at a market drop and sell at the bottom Opens the door to reducing portfolio exposure to outperforming sectors or adding to underperforming areas of the market Has the potential for conflict with certain tax loss harvesting strategies Assumes that you\u2019ve chosen your own investments, which requires study and basic financial knowledge Rebalancing is one component of the investment selection and management package. Here are additional tips to aid in successful rebalancing: Remember that investing is a way to turn today's earnings into future financial security.\u00a0Investing and rebalancing are designed to increase your returns over the long term, such as five or more years. For shorter-term goals, consider a certificate of deposit or high-yield money market account. Investors need a mix of higher-return stocks for growth and capital appreciation. But too many individual stocks or stock funds might make your portfolio too volatile. Stocks are more volatile than bonds and might increase 20% in one year and decline that amount or more in another. Bonds deliver lower returns and typically trade in a narrower range with smaller projected gains and losses than stock investments. If you don\u2019t rebalance and restore your assets to the 80% vs. 20% stock/bond mix and stocks become too large a portion of your portfolio, then you might experience a greater loss than you\u2019re comfortable with on occasion. Rebalancing helps your investments stay on track to meet your financial goals. Most investment brokers don\u2019t charge commissions or trading fees for stocks and ETFs. So buying and selling stocks and funds is typically fee-free. If you own individual bonds, you\u2019re apt to pay a commission to buy or sell. Mutual funds might also levy a fee to trade. As long as you\u2019re buying and selling stocks or ETFs, the only fee you might incur is a tax on a capital gain, realized in a taxable brokerage account. Yes, you can rebalance your portfolio without selling. If you\u2019re adding new money into the portfolio, buy the asset class that is underrepresented. If you buy enough shares, you can return the funds or individual holdings back to their preferred asset allocation. If you need to withdraw funds from your account, sell the overrepresented asset. You can also reinvest cash dividend payments into an under-allocated asset class. Rebalancing reduces returns in most cases. Stocks have returned approximately 10% over the last century, so they'll become a greater percentage of the total portfolio over time without rebalancing. Stocks are also riskier and more volatile, so the growing stock allocation of the unbalanced portfolio will lead to higher returns, along with greater volatility. Rebalancing is usually a tradeoff between greater return and lower volatility. Rebalancing too frequently can sacrifice returns. Rebalancing less often can bolster returns and increase portfolio volatility. Vanguard recommends checking your portfolio every six months, and rebalancing if the values drift 5% or more from target. There isn\u2019t a perfect rebalancing solution. The key is to set up a rebalancing schedule that works for you, create a reminder, and stick with it. Rebalancing will keep your preferred asset allocation in check and help to smooth out the volatility of your portfolio. When stock prices soar, rebalancing will force you to take some profits. When prices are lower, and an asset class declines in value, you\u2019ll buy at lower levels. Ultimately, the best way to rebalance is the strategy that works for you. Less frequent rebalancing saves you time and might allow your winning assets to grow for a bit longer.

When you hold uninvested cash in your brokerage account, this is money that\u2019s not earning a return in the market. This can feel like a wasted opportunity, especially at a time when banks are paying some of the highest interest rates in over a decade. Fortunately, some investment platforms offer features where your uninvested cash earns interest. The broker itself doesn\u2019t pay interest. Instead, it puts idle cash from investors into an FDIC-insured bank account. This system, known as a cash sweep program, can allow you to still earn a decent interest rate while keeping your money available to invest. Ideally, a sweep program is convenient, doesn\u2019t charge you a fee, and has simple account requirements. If you expect to hold uninvested cash, here are the best investment accounts worth considering. Betterment will now match 1% of your net Roth and traditional IRA contributions until December 30, 2024. Terms apply. Get started today. If you\u2019d like help with your portfolio, Betterment is a robo-advisor that takes care of the investment decisions for you. You simply pick a type of portfolio strategy, then Betterment\u2019s robo-advisor will build a portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets to meet these goals. In exchange, it charges a flat fee: $4 per month or 0.25% of accounts worth at least $20,000. This is considerably less than the 1% or more per year charged by a human advisor. To go with its robo-advisor, Betterment offers a high-yield cash account called Cash Reserve. The Cash Reserve account earns a very high annual percentage yield (APY) of 4.25% APY on all balances, as of November 2024. There\u2019s no minimum balance required to earn interest and the rate applies to all accounts, and your balance receives FDIC insurance up to $2 million. Once you\u2019re ready to invest, you can then transfer the cash to your Betterment portfolios. Alternatively, Betterment offers a no-fee checking account. You could transfer cash to this account to spend on a debit card or make ATM withdrawals. However, it doesn\u2019t earn interest like the Cash Reserve account. Pays an excellent cash interest rate No account minimum to earn interest Robo-advisor automatically manages investments Good selection of investment portfolios Easy-to-use accounts No investment options beyond the robo-advisor Portfolios only use ETFs as investments Doesn\u2019t allow margin trading No weekend live customer service Interactive Brokers Interactive Brokers is one of the best options for serious traders and investors. Its platform offers a wide range of investment technology, advanced research, and access to over 150 markets. Interactive Brokers offers commission-free trading for stocks and ETFs through its IBKR Lite program. It does charge low commissions for its more advanced IBKR Pro platform in exchange for more trading capabilities and better order execution. Interactive Brokers offers a program for uninvested cash that should be highly appealing for serious investors. As of November 2024, it pays an interest rate of 3.08% for IBKR Lite accounts and 4.08% for IBKR Pro accounts on balances above $10,000. As rates change over time, IBKR Lite accounts earn one percentage point less than IBKR Pro. You don\u2019t need to opt in to earn interest. However, you can join an additional sweep program to get more FDIC insurance on your cash balance: $2.5 million of coverage on top of the normal SIPC coverage of $250,000. The drawback with Interactive Brokers is you need a large account balance to earn its best rate. If your total brokerage account balance is over $100,000, you earn interest on all your uninvested cash. However, if your account value is less than $100,000, Interactive Brokers will not pay interest on your first $10,000 of uninvested cash. On an $11,000 cash balance, only $1,000 would earn interest.

Empower offers aggregate FDIC insurance up to $5 million on your balance. While you can transfer money out of the cash account as often as you want, Empower does set a daily withdrawal limit of $100,000.

Its platform is user-friendly for beginners, yet offers plenty of screeners, portfolio analysis tools, and other features for serious investors. For this reason, it ranked as the best overall broker in our review of Best Online Brokers and Trading Platforms. Fidelity\u2019s program for uninvested cash is also simple and competitive, offering 4.32% on uninvested cash through a sweep into money market funds. Fidelity's cash management program operates more like a bank account, offering bill pay, an ATM card, and mobile check deposit. The cash management program earns an APY of 2.35%, as of November 2024. If you have both types of Fidelity accounts, you can transfer cash back and forth. Automatically pays a high interest rate on cash All sized accounts earn interest Low costs and trading commissions User-friendly, powerful investment platform High quality research tools and educational materials Charges fees for international stock and currency trades No commodities or futures trading High fees for broker-assisted trades Above-average fees for options Robinhood When it first hit the scene, Robinhood made a big splash in the investment world. Robinhood\u2019s app made investing incredibly easy\u2014some might say even too easy. Robinhood\u2019s trading app offers zero-commission trades for stocks, ETFs, options, and cryptocurrencies. Its investment research tools are a little limited compared to major desktop platforms, but are enough for casual investors. Robinhood does have a competitive program for uninvested cash, but there\u2019s a catch. You must have a Robinhood Gold account to qualify for its highly advertised rate. Robinhood Gold offers premium features like Morningstar research, a larger limit for instant deposits, and lower rates for margin investing at a cost of $5 per month. If you pay for Robinhood Gold, you earn 4.25% on all your uninvested cash. However, if you just have a free Robinhood account, you only earn 0.1%. Whether the $5 monthly fee is worth it depends on the size of your cash balance and whether you want the other Gold benefits. To use Robinhood\u2019s program, you must opt in to use cash sweep on the app. This makes you eligible to earn interest and increases the FDIC coverage of your cash balance to $2.25 million. There\u2019s no minimum or maximum balance requirement to earn interest. High interest rate for Robinhood Gold users Zero commission trades App is very easy to use Fractional share trading available No minimum balance requirements Must pay $5 monthly for Robinhood Gold for highest APY Free accounts earn a moderate interest rate Only basic research tools Limited asset selection When evaluating investment accounts for uninvested cash, accessibility is crucial to ensuring that investors can easily access their cash when needed without facing unnecessary restrictions or penalties. Additionally, safety is paramount, with investors seeking accounts that offer FDIC insurance to safeguard their uninvested cash against the loss of their deposits in an FDIC-insured bank or savings association that fails. The APY earned is another critical consideration, as investors aim to maximize the return on their uninvested cash while maintaining liquidity and safety.\u00a0Moreover, investors should also assess any associated fees or account minimums when comparing investment accounts for uninvested cash. Minimizing fees and meeting any required minimum balances can help investors optimize their cash management strategy and maximize the return on their uninvested cash. By prioritizing liquidity, safety, yield, and cost-effectiveness, investors can select an investment account that aligns with their cash management needs and helps them achieve their financial goals effectively. - Amrut Deshmukh, Investopedia Research Analyst All the brokers on this list offer excellent programs for uninvested cash, assuming you can qualify for the best rates. The right fit depends on your investment goals as well as expected account balance. Interactive Brokers makes sense for serious investors who want the most investment capabilities, but it is actually Fidelity with the highest interest rate and an amazing platform of its own. Betterment and Wealthfront are both solid if you want a robo-advisor. They are quite similar and the right fit depends on which platform you prefer. Empower\u2019s cash account is also very good. There\u2019s no minimum account balance to use it, plus you get access to free financial planning tools. However, you need $100,000 to invest through Empower\u2019s robo-advisor. Last, Robinhood\u2019s program is very competitive if you\u2019re willing to pay $5 monthly for Robinhood Gold. Otherwise, its rate is mediocre compared to the others. Outside of the brokerage accounts, the simplest way to earn interest on cash is by keeping it in a high-yield savings account or money market account. There are online banks paying interest rates far above what you would earn from the major brick-and-mortar banks. With savings and money market accounts, you also keep instant access to your cash. If you\u2019re willing to lock your money up temporarily, you could put it in a bank certificate of deposit (CD). These can pay a higher interest rate, but you need to keep the money in for a set number of months or years. If you withdraw it early, you must pay a penalty. Bonds are another option. They pay interest, but there can be a risk of nonpayment, like if the bond issuer goes bankrupt. Generally, the higher the bond risk, the higher the interest rate. Rating agencies give companies, governments, and other bond issuers a letter grade showing how safe they are. Savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs are a risk-free way to invest your cash. These accounts receive FDIC insurance up to $250,000 per depositor per bank. Even if the bank goes bankrupt, the government promises you\u2019ll get your money back. Cash in a brokerage account is also very safe as it is insured by the SIPC up to $250,000. U.S. government bonds are also considered risk-free because of the stability of the United States. The federal government promises to make these payments and return your principal. Treasuries, I-Bonds, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are a few possibilities. A fixed annuity is one more very safe option. These contracts pay a set interest rate, guaranteed by an insurance company. You do agree to keep the money in the annuity for a set number of years, though, or you\u2019ll owe a penalty for canceling. As of September 2024, the cash earnings interest rate on Robinhood was 0.1% APY for free accounts and 4.50% for Robinhood Gold accounts. You do need to pay $5 a month for Robinhood Gold to get the higher rate. The interest rates also change based on market conditions. To start earning interest on your Robinhood balance, you must enroll in its cash sweep program. Then the app automatically places your uninvested cash in banks to earn the high interest rate. This program gives you additional FDIC protection, insuring your balance up to $2.25 million for uninvested cash.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn what it takes to automate your investing Automated investing might be the smartest way to simplify wealth-building. By automating your investing you\u2019re less likely to miss funds as they are withdrawn from your paycheck and\u00a0 transferred directly into your 401(k) or an investment account. From beginners to sophisticated options traders, automated investing is a crucial strategy to compound investment growth. We\u2019ve designed this guide to help you explore the ways to automate your investing from simply reinvesting dividends to regular transfers into a robo-advisor. It\u2019s usually quick and easy to automate your investing. Before setting up the account, review the platform\u2019s FAQ pages for the range of account minimums and potential approvals needed to open an automated investing account. Each platform will have its own process. Next, gather your bank account and personal information, such as your Social Security number. The investment account platform will walk you through the process step-by-step. Here\u2019s what you can expect when setting up your automated investing account: You can set up an automated investment plan in a variety of ways. From robo-advisors to your employer 401(k), we\u2019ll give you the rundown. Choose one or more automated investment types to ensure that you are converting today\u2019s earnings into wealth for tomorrow. First, find out what information is required to open an automated investing account. The personal information and documentation required to complete the onboarding process typically includes: Fortunately for investors, there are many automated investment accounts with low-minimum deposit requirements. Minimum deposits can range from zero for many well-known investment brokerage firms up to $100,000 for the comprehensive Empower robo-advisor, which also includes access to certified financial planners. If you are new to investing and just starting out, you might open your automated investing account at a major brokerage firm that doesn\u2019t require a minimum investment, such as Fidelity Go. Or, if you\u2019re seeking a robo-advisor with low minimums, SoFi Automated Investing, M1 Finance, Betterment, Ally, and Ellevest all require $100 or less to get started. With so many choices about how to automate investing, it can be confusing to narrow down your selection. To make the decision easier, evaluate these factors: Customer service: Phone customer service can be very important for both new and experienced investors. Be aware that some platforms do not offer live customer service. If talking to a human matters to you, then look into live customer service availability and contact times. Fees and commissions: Research from Vanguard and other firms has shown a direct correlation between lower fees and higher investment performance. Before investing with any platform, understand the fees you\u2019ll be paying, including management fees and fund expense ratios. Determine whether the services you\u2019re receiving are worth the fees. Account minimum: Investigate how much money you\u2019ll need to open the account as well as maintain it. Determine whether there is a minimum balance requirement and if it is suitable for your financial situation. Research tools: For self-directed investment accounts, carefully review the screeners, calculators, trading platforms, and research report availability. If you\u2019re a self-directed investor, make certain, before opening an account, that the research tools match up with your needs. Automated investing is a strategy to ensure that you regularly save and invest for the future. We all have the tendency to forget to implement our best intentions. New Year's resolutions are frequently forgotten by February. Automated investing pre-programs our behavior to put investing for the future first. Automated investing is best for anyone interested in converting today's earnings into tomorrow's prosperity. This strategy works when saving for retirement, a child's college education, general wealth-building, and saving for any goal that is more than five years in the future. The automated investment concept involves implementing a few simple steps. First, select a paycheck, personal checking, or savings account from which the investment funds will be drawn. Next, choose where you want to invest. The choices include your workplace retirement account, a self-directed investment account, a micro-investing app, or a robo-advisor. Reinvesting your dividends and capital gains within your brokerage account is also considered automated investing. Pick the specific investments, and then set up a regular transfer from the cash account into the investment account. Finally, you choose the amount and frequency of your auto investment strategy. Once the plan is enacted, your money will automatically transfer into the designated accounts and investments. That way, when markets go down, you\u2019ll be less tempted to stop investing, because the entire process is automated. In fact, when markets go down, you\u2019ll be set up to benefit from one of the best investment tenets: \u201cBuy low.\u201d Think of automated investing like automated bill pay. You set up the parameters, such as amount to be invested, the investment vehicles, and the funding method. After setup, regular transfers from your bank account or paycheck go directly to your investment accounts.\u00a0This automates the contributions to your investment account. If you have a self-directed account, you may have another step to them put that money to work. Often this can be eliminated if you are buying into pre-built portfolios offered by your brokerage. You can also automate the investment portfolio through a robo-advisor where the contributions will automatically be invested according to the allocations and rules that were created as part of your account setup. Automated investing is a good idea for nearly everyone. Behavioral finance research suggests that we are not always rational decision-makers. By helping you overcome less optimal investment behavior, such as irregular investing or avoiding investment, automated investing can improve your long-term financial success. Automated investing removes money from your account before you can spend it and diverts it into long-term financial assets, leading to wealth-building, Investing in financial markets is risky in that the value of your initial investment can decline. In fact, automated investing might be considered less risky than do-it-yourself investing. By regularly deploying money into the financial markets during both up and down markets, you are practicing dollar-cost-averaging. This ensures that you will buy more shares when prices are lower and fewer shares when prices are higher. This is the \u201cbuy low\u201d recommendation in action. Micro-investing apps have their pros and cons. The benefit of these round-up investment apps is that you can get started and continue investing regularly. The disadvantage is that if you only invest your spare change and do not set up a larger automated deposit into the app, it will take you a long time to build a substantial account balance. For example, assume that monthly, you invest $50 in spare change into your investment account, which earns an average 7% per year. After 10 years, that account will be worth $8,704. Now add in a $350 monthly auto deposit in addition to the $50 spare change investment and you\u2019re investing $400 per month. With an average 7% annual return, your account will grow to roughly $69,637 in 10 years. Yes, there are multiple reasons to use an automated investing platform. Anyone serious about planning for their future would be wise to consider setting up automated investment strategies.

            "title": "Best Ways to Earn Passive Income",
            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn the best ways to earn passive income and build wealth Bus\u00c3\u00a0 Photography / Getty Images The best ways to earn passive income aren\u2019t only the purview of the wealthy. With a modicum of startup time and capital, anyone can create a passive income stream. Whether you have a full-time job or are a retiree seeking extra cash, passive income ideas are available to increase your cash flow. Passive income isn\u2019t literally money without effort, but more akin to money with less effort. Some passive income strategies, like owning dividend-paying stocks or bonds, require less work than owning rental real estate. This guide covers how to get started, how much passive income you can earn, the required effort, and various passive income investments. 15 Passive Income Ideas: There are scores of passive income sources and ways to start earning passive income. Before you begin, you\u2019ll need to figure out how much effort and money you want to expend. Then choose a passive income idea that fits your capital, skills, and interests. Step 1: Choose passive income streams. Decide whether you want to invest for passive income or run a side gig that generates some cash. Either way, it typically takes some time to build up a decent cash flow. Step 2: Choose the platform that fits your needs. If you\u2019re seeking passive investment income, there are many financial brokerage firms, mobile investment apps, and banks that will suffice. However, there are other measures you can consider. For instance, you can learn how to make passive income online by selling products and services. With a social media account like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, or a website, you can market products and services quite effectively. These are among the best ways to earn passive income, and the required effort is greater in the beginning and diminishes as time passes. Step 3: Set your expectations. Earning passive income from investing involves predicting your return based upon the investment amount. A $5,000 investment in a dividend fund that pays a 6% yield will provide $300 per year, while successful affiliate websites might earn $1,000 per month or more. The best passive income opportunities often involve balancing human capital, financial capital, and time. Investing in financial markets involves banking and financial products like stocks and bonds. Buying banking products like certificates of deposit and high-yield cash accounts is less risky, but has lower upside potential than investing in financial market assets. Passive investing in dividend-paying stocks or interest-paying bonds provides cash flow but requires a larger investment to realize meaningful monthly income. Crowdfunding investment apps also enable the public to buy shares in farmland, large and small real estate projects, wine, art, and more to receive ongoing cash flow. There is a range of risk levels when investing in financial assets. The lowest-risk cash flow-producing assets are money market mutual funds, high-yield savings accounts, and bank certificates of deposit. Investing in dividend-paying stocks or stock funds carries the risk that the dividend will be cut and also that the principal value of the investment might fall. Interest-paying bonds and bond funds will vary in price as well, but the interest payments are rarely cut. Individual bonds, held until maturity, will return the par or full value of the investment. But bonds sold before maturity and bond funds might be sold for less, or more, than your original payment amount. Crowdfunding apps that invest in real estate, farmland, startups, art, wine, and more carry additional risks. Many require long lockup periods before you can withdraw your money. Others are not as closely regulated as traditional financial assets. With newer platforms, there is a greater chance of asset defaults and business closures. Buying dividend-paying stocks is a path to owning a portion of a publicly traded company. Many stocks pay a portion of their earnings to shareholders in the form of cash dividends, which are usually paid quarterly. You have the option to reinvest the cash payment in additional shares of stock or to take the cash dividend payment. Long-term investors who build up a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks or funds have one of the best ways to earn passive income.\u00a0Investing in dividend-paying stocks is a passive income idea with both cash flow and capital growth potential. A dividend exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle that owns many dividend-paying stocks. You can buy one investment, such as the SPDR S&P Global Dividend ETF (WDIV), and receive access to a portfolio of dividend-paying companies. The WDIV ETF owns global companies that frequently pay higher dividends than U.S. firms. Many dividend ETFs also screen for companies with a history of increasing dividends. The dividend ETF is another passive income investment that provides regular cash payments along with an added bonus of capital appreciation potential. Consider management fees when choosing a dividend exchange-traded fund, as higher fund fees can detract from returns. Bonds are back in favor as interest rates are higher than they\u2019ve been in decades. Unlike stocks, bond investments are loans that you make to a company or government entity. In exchange for the loan, you receive regular coupon interest payments. Bonds are among the best ways to earn passive income because if you buy a newly issued bond at par, usually $1,000, and hold it until maturity, you\u2019ll receive regular cash interest payments and a return of principal at the bond's maturity. Bonds with lower credit ratings typically provide higher interest payments and greater cash flow, while government bonds and highly rated corporate bonds will offer lower interest payments. Bond values can rise and fall, so you might receive more or less than your initial price, should you sell before maturity. The bond\u2019s credit rating suggests the bond\u2019s likelihood of default, with lower-rated bonds carrying a higher risk of default. Investors can also invest in diversified bond mutual or exchange-traded funds to build passive income without lifting a finger. Bundle together a group of individual bonds, and you have a bond fund. With differing bond maturities and investment styles, there are multiple ways to generate passive income with bond funds. Those comfortable with a risky asset can purchase a high-yield bond fund like the SPDR Blmbg ST HY Bd ETF (SJNK), which has a current 7.05% SEC yield. More conservative investors can buy a diversified government bond fund and receive regular interest payments that are exempt from state and local taxes.\u00a0Unlike buying an individual bond, both the coupon or interest payment and the fund value will vary. Certificates of deposit (CDs) are banking products that you can buy at most financial institutions. You invest a specific amount of money, typically $100 or more, and leave the money invested for a period of time. CDs typically pay a pre-specified interest rate and are usually issued for terms from three months to five years or more. There are a variety of CD types, including fixed and floating variable interest rates. Investors seeking regular cash flow and a stable principal value can create a CD ladder and buy CDs at regular intervals. As one CD comes due, you reinvest the proceeds in a new certificate of deposit. Ladders are among the best passive income investments to increase cash flow when you expect interest rates to rise. A bank high-yield savings account pays higher interest payments than a typical savings account. The required minimum balance can be greater than that of a savings account. If you\u2019re wondering how to make passive income, a high-yield savings account is a good choice. For passive income from money that you need for near-term expenses and emergencies, a high-yield savings account is a sound choice and keeps your funds liquid. The process of opening a high-yield savings account is similar to opening a traditional bank account. Simply click on the \u201copen an account\u201d button on your preferred bank\u2019s website and answer several personal questions, such as address, Social Security number, and type of account. To verify your identity, you might need to supply prior addresses, debts, and employment details. A money market mutual fund is an investment vehicle that owns short-term commercial debt. This investment is distinct from a money market bank account, which is similar to a high-yield bank savings account. Like a typical mutual fund, money from many investors is pooled to invest in short-term debt and cash-equivalent instruments. The allure of these accounts is that the share value is pegged at one dollar, and yields are among the highest of the high-yield cash equivalent group. You\u2019ll need to invest in a money market fund within an investment brokerage account. These investments are liquid, and the money can be withdrawn within a few days. The interest from money market funds can be withdrawn for cash flow or reinvested to grow for the future. You\u2019ll find a laundry list of alternatives to stock, bond, and cash passive income ideas. Some of these choices are more passive than others. Real estate investing is frequently touted as a response to the question, \u201cWhat is the best way to earn passive income?\u201d But real estate investing takes many forms, and requires varying amounts of effort. Owning and managing real property requires a chunk of capital and is a passive endeavor until a pipe breaks or the renter doesn\u2019t pay their rent. Then it is a lot of work. Real estate crowdfunding apps or investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs) are more passive. Once you purchase the securities, you wait for the cash flow. Another popular way to earn passive income online is by creating an affiliate website, but this involves more work than meets the eye. An Airbnb rental is only semi-passive if you hire a team to manage the property. Cash-back credit cards and shopping sites might be considered a passive income idea, yet you\u2019re spending in order to receive the cash. That\u2019s not a net-positive endeavor. Other alternatives to passive income involve digital property sales, like e-books, courses, apps, and other online goods. For all of these passive income ideas, there is a hefty startup time commitment and some upfront cash as well. You\u2019re also less certain of receiving a return on your investment if the sales miss expectations. Evaluate these alternatives to passive income to learn whether there's a strategy for you. A real estate investment trust or REIT is an investment vehicle that owns a pool of commercial real estate. There are REITs that provide broad diversification across the real estate landscape. Or you can buy niche REITs that own senior housing, student housing, warehouses, commercial property, mortgages, shopping malls, data centers or many other varieties of property. The benefit of REITs for cash flow is that they are required by law to pay out 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. Debt investing is popular, with many platforms that enable everyday investors to be the bank and lend money to others. Peer-to-peer lending offers various types of loans for various reasons. Platforms match borrowers with lenders for various cash needs. These peer-to-peer lending apps offer higher interest payments than other traditional stock, bond, or cash vehicles. But they are riskier as potential loan payment defaults can eat into your returns. To minimize that risk, you can choose to invest in higher-quality loans and diversify by owning many loans. Real estate crowdfunding allows investors to finance real estate projects through online platforms with the goal of profiting either from capital appreciation or passive income. There are a range of real estate crowdfunding websites offering small to large investors an entry into commercial, industrial, single-family, and apartment building investing. Fundrise is our 2024 best real estate crowdfunding website. It provides investment access to real estate and startup venture capital funding with only a $10 minimum. Real estate crowdfunding can deliver a higher interest rate than REITs, but it has less liquidity, less government oversight, and a greater risk of default. Real estate debt or note investing puts you in a banker's seat. You lend money to those seeking to buy new real estate, remodel existing property, fix and flip, and a variety of other types of real estate investors. Apps like Groundfloor provide investors the opportunity to lend to real estate buyers. The allure of lending to real estate borrowers is that your investment is secured by real property. Some of the larger real estate crowdfunding apps also deliver real estate note investing. A drawback to real estate note investing also makes it one of the best investments for passive income. Unlike publicly traded securities, you can\u2019t immediately redeem your shares, but may need to wait several months or more for a return of your principal investment. The lack of liquidity can also lead to higher investment returns. Affiliate marketers sell products and services on their websites or social media accounts and receive a commission from the brand for the sale. Affiliate marketers frequently write reviews to draw visitors to their websites. The setup for affiliate marketing is not passive and involves creating a website or social media platform, developing contracts with companies who pay affiliates, and creating content to draw visitors to the website. The passive aspect of affiliate marketing is that once the content is written and a website develops a stream of visitors, your work is diminished. That\u2019s only partially true, as you\u2019ll need to write new content and update old content in order to maintain and increase website traffic. Additionally, it can take months or more to begin to generate cash flow. We place affiliate marketing on the higher-effort step of the passive income ideas ladder. Creating digital products or content, such as online courses, is among the best ways to earn passive income online. Similar to affiliate marketing, you\u2019ll sell your digital products online through a variety of outlets, such as an Etsy store, social media platform, YouTube, or a website. Align your digital products with your area of expertise. Sample types of digital products include printouts, e-courses, e-books, webinars, and more. This is not the best passive income idea for beginners with limited free time. Making passive income with digital product sales initially requires market analysis, product creation, and marketing before realizing decent passive income flow. Drivers with cars can get paid to wrap their cars in advertisement banners. We found firms that paid from $100 to $500 per month just for driving with an advertisement on their car. For anyone wondering, \u201cWhat is the simplest way to make passive income?\u201d Car wrapping is not without its limitations. Car wrapping scams exist and, unfortunately, are abundant in the industry. Don\u2019t pay money upfront for access to advertise with car wrapping. You\u2019ll also need to accept the advertiser's stipulations of mileage, and other factors. Finally, making passive income by advertising on your car means that you need to drive around with an ad on your car. To put this in perspective, the ad can be simply placed on the door or hood of your car, or it can be wrapped around the entire vehicle. Make sure you understand what\u2019s needed before signing a binding contract. Creating an online store with drop shipping can answer the question, \u201cHow can I passively make $1,000 a month?\u201d After setting up your product inventory, payment system, and marketing strategy, drop shipping is among the simplest ways to make money online. Select products from manufacturers or wholesalers and sell them as your own inventory. The supplier handles the inventory and shipping, so you can grow your brand and market the shop. Like most passive online income strategies, after setting up the business, you\u2019ll need to devote a lot of time to marketing. You can market your store through a website and/or social media. Once you\u2019re up and running, with brand recognition and customers, maintaining an online store with drop shipping is a good form of passive income. All passive income ideas require startup capital. To develop a meaningful passive income stream from financial assets like cash equivalents, stocks, and bonds, you\u2019ll need a decent account balance. With $100,000, an investment paying a 5% dividend or interest payment provides $5,000 per year cash flow. Although affiliate marketing requires a small cash outlay to potentially obtain cash flow, you\u2019ll pay more with your human capital or time. All investments carry a degree of risk. Certificates of deposit and high-yield cash investments don\u2019t risk the principal value of your investment, but they could lose purchasing power over time due to inflation. Investing in higher-risk dividend-paying financial assets involves the potential to lose principal and decrease cash flow should dividends be cut. Crowdfunding passive income investments are less regulated and can tie up your money for longer periods with added risks of defaults and platform failures. With the exception of tax-exempt municipal bonds from your state of residence, all income is taxed by the government. After-tax income is what really matters, so understand how your investment is taxed, and your specific marginal tax bracket. Dividends and interest payments may have their own tax rates. Passive income is money that you earn without much effort. In contrast with earned income, from a job, passive income flows after an initial startup effort and cost to create long-term cash flow. Passive income ideas span low-effort activities such as buying a high dividend bond fund to creating online businesses that require an initial startup effort which becomes less labor-intensive over time. There is a fine line between active and passive income. Clearly, going to work every day in exchange for a regular paycheck is active income. Task work such as food delivery, rideshare driving, freelance jobs, consulting, and contract work are also ways to create active income. With active income, you get paid for working. Passive income ideas span a range of jobs that require less effort than active income. Receiving income in exchange for zero effort is unlikely unless you count receiving an inheritance or winning the lottery. Writing a book and then receiving royalties is a great example of passive income, yet with the passage of time, book royalties will decline. In contrast, if you buy a dividend-paying stock fund, once you select the investment, you will receive ongoing dividend payments without much additional effort. Some passive income ideas are liquid, like buying dividend-paying investments, while others are less liquid, like long-term real estate syndications. Some passive income jobs require minor ongoing work in exchange for cash flow, while others are less passive and involve greater ongoing effort. Passive income strategies range from those with a small startup effort, like investing in dividend-paying stock or money market mutual funds, to more labor-intensive ones, such as managing rental properties or creating an affiliate marketing review website. By creating digital products like courses, apps, e-books, and more and selling them, you can create passive income with minimal cash. Books can be sold on digital marketplaces like Amazon, while you can sell other products through your social media accounts or an online store. While you don\u2019t need a lot of cash to create digital products, you need time and effort to market and sell them. If you have a job with a 401(k) or other retirement account, you can contribute part of your paycheck to that account and invest in financial assets. At retirement, you\u2019ll have enough money to create a passive income stream. Yes, you can live off of passive income. It\u2019s easiest to live off of passive income if you live in an area with a low cost of living. To live off of financial investment and cash-equivalent income, you\u2019ll need a larger amount of money. To earn $30,000 per year, you\u2019ll need $600,000 invested at 5% per year. To live off of digital product or service sales, you\u2019ll need to earn several thousand dollars per month. The same goes for affiliate marketing. Older individuals who have built up a large amount of investable assets are most likely to be able to live off of passive income. The exceptions are those who\u2019ve made a lot of money early in life, live simply, and invest for income and capital growth. To pick the right passive income idea, assess your available time, risk tolerance level, and available capital. Also, explore your skill sets to determine which passive income ideas are a good fit for you. The easiest way to start investing for future passive income is to start small and automate your investing. Everyone should consider investing for the future. When you are older, it\u2019s easier to create a passive income stream with investing. Younger individuals with ambition and the ability to motivate themselves are wise to consider creating passive income streams through online stores and creating digital products. Employment is uncertain, and creating multiple streams of income is a sound financial plan. Yes, all income is taxable. Earned income is taxed at the federal, state, and local level. You\u2019ll also pay self-employment tax with earned self-employment income. Investment income has its own tax considerations. While real estate can be taxed in various ways. To understand how passive income is taxed, it\u2019s wise to visit the IRS website for more details. Online tax software programs such as Turbo Tax can help you estimate the tax you\u2019ll pay on passive income. While passive income won\u2019t impact the amount of your Social Security benefit, it can affect the amount of tax you\u2019re required to pay.\u00a0 Up to 85% of your Social Security benefits can be taxed. Like all IRS regulations, there is a list of criteria to determine the impact of your passive income on the taxation of your Social Security benefits. Visit the SSA.gov website to understand how your passive income could impact the taxation of your Social Security benefits. Teenagers have many money-making ideas available to them. Unless you have access to a large sum of money, earning passive income through investing in dividend-paying assets is unlikely. Creating an online business as a teenager is a potential path to future passive income. Starting an online store, selling digital products, creating an e-course, or writing product reviews are all paths to ultimately making passive income as a teenager. Teenagers can promote their businesses online through a website and/or social media accounts. These beginner passive income ideas require substantial startup effort and a modicum of long-term maintenance.

            "content": "Adam Hayes, Ph.D., CFA, is a financial writer with 15+ years Wall Street experience as a derivatives trader. Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master's in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology. He is a CFA charterholder as well as holding FINRA Series 7, 55 & 63 licenses. He currently researches and teaches economic sociology and the social studies of finance at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Excess cash flow is a term used in loan agreements or bond indentures and refers to the portion of cash flows of a company that are required to be repaid to a lender. Excess cash flow is typically cash received or generated by a company in the form of revenues or investments that triggers a payment to the lender as stipulated in their credit agreement. Since the company has an outstanding loan with one or more creditors, certain cash flows are subject to various earmarks or restrictions for usage by the company. Excess cash flows conditions are written into loan agreements or bond indentures as restrictive covenants to provide additional cover for credit risk for lenders or bond investors. If an event occurs that results in excess cash flows as defined in the credit agreement, the company must make a payment to the lender. The payment could be made a percentage of the excess flow, which is usually dependent on what event generated the excess cash flow. Lenders thus impose restrictions on how excess cash can be spent in an effort to maintain control of the company's cash flow. But the lender must also be careful that these restrictions and limitations are not so strict that they impede the company's financial standing or ability to grow, which could end up causing self-inflicted harm to the lender. Lenders define what is considered an excess cash flow usually by a formula that consists of a percentage or amount above and beyond expected net income or profit over some time period. However, that formula will vary from lender to lender, and it is up to the borrower to negotiate these terms with the lender. If a company raises additional capital through some funding measure such as a stock issuance, the company would likely be required to pay the lender the amount generated minus any expenses that occurred to generate the capital. For example, if a company issues new equity in a secondary offering, the money raised would trigger a payment to the lender. Also, if a company-issued debt through a bond offering, the proceeds would likely trigger a payment to the lender. Asset sales could also trigger a payment. A company might have investments or hold shares such as a minority interest in other companies. If the company sold those investments for a profit, the lender would likely require payment for those funds. Proceeds earned from a spin-off, acquisition, or windfall income from winning a lawsuit may also trigger the clause. Certain asset sales might be excluded from triggering a payment such as the sale of inventory. A company in its normal course of operation might need to buy and sell inventory to generate its operating income. As a result, it's likely that an asset sale, which comprises of inventory would be exempt from a prepayment obligation. Other operating expenses or capital expenditures (CAPEX) might be exempt from triggering a payment such as cash used as deposits to land new business or cash held at a bank that's used to help pay for a financial product that hedges market risk for the company. There is no set formula for calculating excess cash flows since each credit agreement will tend to have somewhat different requirements that will result in a payment to the lender. An approximation of a calculation of excess cash flow could begin with taking the company's profit or net income, adding back depreciation and amortization, and deducting capital expenditures that are necessary to sustain business operations, and dividends, if any. In other words, a credit agreement might outline an amount of excess cash flow that triggers a payment, but also how cash is used or spent. A lender might allow cash to be used for business operations, possibly dividends, and certain capital expenditures. The terms defining excess cash flow and any payments are typically negotiated between the borrower and the lender. If excess cash flow is generated, a lender might require a payment that is 100%, 75%, or 50% of the excess cash flow amount. Free cash flow i(FCF) s the cash a company\u00a0produces through its operations, less the cost of expenditures on assets. In other words, free cash flow is the cash left over after a company\u00a0pays for\u00a0its operating expenses\u00a0and capital expenditures. FCF shows how efficient a company is\u00a0at generating cash. Investors use free cash flow to measure whether a company might have enough cash,\u00a0after funding\u00a0operations and capital expenditures, to pay investors through\u00a0dividends\u00a0and\u00a0share buybacks. The excess cash flow amount for a company is different than a company's free cash flow figure. Excess cash flow is defined in the credit agreement, which might stipulate for certain expenditures to be excluded in the calculation of excess cash flow. Exceptions to excess cash flow might be taxes paid, cash used to generate new business, but these cash outlays would be included in the free cash flow calculation. In 2010, Dunkin' Brands, Inc. entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Bank PLC and a number of other lenders party to the agreement for a US$1.25 billion term B loan and $100 million revolver lines of credit. Below are the legal terms used in the credit agreement defining excess cash flow. Under \"Defined Terms\" of the agreement, excess cash flow is spelled out in a verbal formula as \"an amount equal to the excess of\": Over: All the capitalized terms in the above excerpt are \"Defined Terms\" in the agreement. The excess of \"(a)\" items over \"(b)\" items are carefully laid out as the definition of excess cash flow. The highlighted items in the above example are by no means exhaustive; instead, they illustrate the fine details of a definition of excess cash flow. As with any financial metric, there are limitations to using excess cash flow as a measure of a company's performance. The amount that's considered excess is determined by the lender and doesn't represent the true cash flow of the company since items are excluded from its calculation to help the business improve its performance to ensure repayment of the debt. Say that hypothetical Company A has the following financial results at the end of the year: Assume that both Capex and the interest paid are allowed under the credit agreement meaning the company can use cash for those expenses. However, any cash left over after deducting the expenses from net income would be considered excess and trigger a payment to the lender."

A convexity adjustment is a change required to be made to a forward interest rate or yield to get the expected future interest rate or yield. This adjustment is made in response to a difference between the forward interest rate and the future interest rate; this difference has to be added to the former to arrive at the latter. The need for this adjustment arises because of the non-linear relationship between bond prices and yields. \ufeff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nA\n\n\n=\n\n\nC\n\n\nV\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n(\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nV\n\n\n=\n\n\nBond\u2019s\u00a0convexity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\ny\n\n\n=\n\n\nChange\u00a0of\u00a0yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{aligned} &CA = CV \\times 100 \\times (\\Delta y)^2 \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &CV=\\text{Bond's convexity} \\\\ &\\Delta y=\\text{Change of yield} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\n\n\n\u200bCA=CV\u00d7100\u00d7(\u0394y)2where:CV=Bond\u2019s\u00a0convexity\u0394y=Change\u00a0of\u00a0yield\u200b\ufeff Convexity refers to the non-linear change in the price of an output given a change in the price or rate of an underlying variable. The price of the output, instead, depends on the second derivative. In reference to bonds, convexity is the second derivative of bond price with respect to interest rates. Bond prices move inversely with interest rates\u2014when interest rates rise, bond prices decline, and vice versa. To state this differently, the relationship between price and yield is not linear, but convex. To measure interest rate risk due to changes in the prevailing interest rates in the economy, the duration of the bond can be calculated. Duration is the weighted average of the present value of coupon payments and principal repayment. It is measured in years and estimates the percent change in a bond\u2019s price for a small change in the interest rate. One can think of duration as the tool that measures the linear change of an otherwise non-linear function. Convexity is the rate that the duration changes along the yield curve. Thus, it's the first derivative of the equation for the duration and the second derivative of the equation for the price-yield function or the function for change in bond prices following a change in interest rates. Because the estimated price change using duration may not be accurate for a large change in yield due to the convex nature of the yield curve, convexity helps to approximate the change in price that is not captured or explained by duration. A convexity adjustment takes into account the curvature of the price-yield relationship shown in a yield curve in order to estimate a more accurate price for larger changes in interest rates. To improve the estimate provided by duration, a convexity adjustment measure can be used.

An adjustment for convexity is often necessary when pricing bonds, interest rate swaps, and other derivatives. This adjustment is required because of the unsymmetrical change in the price of a bond in relation to changes in interest rates or yields. In other words, the percentage increase in the price of a bond for a defined decrease in rates or yields is always more than the decline in the bond price for the same increase in rates or yields. Several factors influence the convexity of a bond, including its coupon rate, duration, maturity, and current price."

She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. A purchase fund is a feature of some bond indentures and preferred stock that requires the issuer to make an effort to purchase a specified amount of securities if they fall below a stipulated price (usually par value). Par value is a term that often describes a bond, but can also apply to a stock. Par value is the face value of a bond. It is the principal amount that the lender, or investor, is lending to the borrower, or issuer. A purchase fund is similar to a sinking fund provision. A sinking fund is formed by periodically putting money aside to eventually pay back a debt or replace an asset that has depreciated. The purchase fund can be an advantage to investors if the fund is trading below par value because the company must pay par to repurchase the bonds. A purchase fund is a fund that is only used by the issuers to buy stocks or bonds when those securities have fallen below the original dollar amount assigned by the issuer. This type of fund can be beneficial to an investor in that if the fund is trading below par value, the company has to pay par value to repurchase the bonds from the investors. If the prices fall, the fund allows the company to redeem its securities at a discount. This redemption fund cuts the risk that the company will be unable to redeem its bonds at maturity. A purchase fund is similar to a sinking fund provision, with a few key differences. A sinking fund is a means of repaying funds borrowed through a bond issue. The funds are repaid through periodic payments to a trustee who retires part of the issue by purchasing the bonds in the\u00a0open market. Rather than the issuer repaying the entire principal of a bond issue on the\u00a0maturity date, another company buys back a portion of the issue annually and usually at fixed\u00a0par value\u00a0or at the current market value of the bonds, whichever is less. A sinking fund adds safety to a corporate bond issue. They can be found in preferred stocks, cash or other bonds. Par value is the face value of a security. The par value of bonds is typically higher than that of stocks and can vary based on whether it is a corporate bond, municipal bond, or a federal bond. Typically a corporate bond has a $1,000 face value, while a municipal bond typically has a $5,000 face value and a federal bond has a $10,000 face value. A company might issue $1,000,000 bonds by issuing 1,000 bonds at $1,000. When the bond matures, the borrower will pay back the face value, in this case, $1,000, to the lender. The par value of stocks is typically small and fairly arbitrary, such as one cent per share. The preferred stock will sometimes have a higher par value because it is used to calculate dividends. Let's say the trucking company Rev decides to issue $20 million of bonds that are due to mature in 10 years. If Rev has a purchase fund, they might be required to retire a certain amount in bonds each year for 10 years, perhaps $2 million per year. To retire those bonds, Rev must deposit $2 million a year into a purchase fund. That purchase fund has to be separate from Rev's operating funds and used exclusively to retire debt. By using this strategy, Rev can guarantee it will pay off the $20 million in 10 years."

            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). A debt/equity swap is a transaction in which the obligations or debts of a company or individual are exchanged for something of value, namely, equity. In the case of a publicly-traded company, this generally entails an exchange of bonds for stock. The value of the stocks and bonds being exchanged is typically determined by the market at the time of the swap. A debt/equity swap is a refinancing deal in which a debt holder gets an equity position in exchange for the cancellation of the debt. The swap is generally done to help a struggling company continue to operate. The logic behind this is an insolvent company cannot pay its debts or improve its equity standing. However, sometimes a company may simply wish to take advantage of favorable market conditions. Covenants in the bond indenture may prevent a swap from happening without consent. In cases of bankruptcy, the debt holder does not have a choice about whether he wants to make the debt/equity swap. However, in other cases, he may have a choice in the matter. To entice people into debt/equity swaps, businesses often offer advantageous trade ratios. For example, if the business offers a 1:1 swap ratio, the bondholder receives stocks worth exactly the same amount as his bonds, not a particularly advantageous trade. However, if the company offers a 1:2 ratio, the bondholder receives stocks valued at twice as much as his bonds, making the trade more enticing. Debt/equity swaps can offer debt holders equity because the business does not want to or cannot pay the face value of the bonds it has issued. To delay repayment, it offers stock\u00a0instead. In other cases, businesses have to maintain certain debt/equity ratios and invite debt holders to swap their debts for equity if\u00a0the company helps to adjust that balance. These debt/equity ratios are often part of financing requirements imposed by lenders. In\u00a0other cases, businesses use debt/equity swaps as part of their bankruptcy restructuring. If a company decides to declare bankruptcy, it has a choice between Chapter 7 and Chapter 11. Under Chapter 7, all of the business's debts are eliminated, and the business no longer operates. Under Chapter 11, the business continues its operations while restructuring its finances. In many cases, Chapter 11 reorganization cancels the company's existing equity shares. It then reissues new shares to the debt holders, and the bondholders and creditors become the new shareholders in the company. An equity/debt swap is the opposite of a debt/equity swap. Instead of trading debt for equity, shareholders swap equity for debt. Essentially, they exchange stocks for bonds. Generally, Equity/Debt swaps are conducted in order to facilitate smooth mergers or restructuring in a company. Suppose company ABC has a $100 million debt that it is unable to service. The company offers 25% percent ownership to its two debtors in exchange for writing off the entire debt amount. This is a debt-for-equity swap in which the company has exchanged its debt holdings for equity ownership by two lenders."

            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). A foreign currency convertible bond (FCCB) is a type of convertible bond issued in a currency different than the issuer's domestic currency. In other words, the money being raised by the issuing company is in the form of foreign currency. A convertible bond is a mix between a debt and equity instrument. It acts like a bond by making regular coupon and principal payments, but these bonds also give the bondholder the option to convert the bond into stock. A bond is a debt instrument that provides income to investors in the form of regularly scheduled interest payments called coupons. At the maturity date of the bond, the investors are repaid the full face value of the bond. Some corporate entities issue a type of bond known as convertible bonds. A bondholder with a convertible bond has the option of converting the bond into a specified number of shares of the issuing company. Convertible bonds have a conversion rate at which the bonds will be converted to equity. However, if the stock price stays below the conversion price, the bond will not be converted. Thus, convertible bonds allow bondholders to participate in the appreciation of the issuer\u2019s underlying shares. There are various types of convertible bonds, one of which is the foreign currency convertible bond. A company may choose to issue FCCBs in the currency of a country with lower interest rates or a more stable economy than the issuer's home country. A foreign currency convertible bond (FCCB) is a convertible bond that is issued in a foreign currency, which means the principal repayment and periodic coupon payments will be made in a foreign currency. For example, an American listed company that issues a bond in India in rupees has, in effect, issued an FCCB. Foreign currency convertible bonds are typically issued by multinational companies operating in a global space and looking to raise capital in foreign currencies. FCCB investors are usually hedge fund arbitrators and foreign nationals. These bonds can be issued along with a call option (whereby the right of redemption lies with the bond issuer) or put options (whereby the right of redemption lies with bondholder). A company may decide to raise money outside its home country to gain access to new markets for new or expansionary projects. FCCBs are generally issued by companies in the currency of those countries where interest rates are usually lower than the home country or foreign country economy is more stable than the home country economy. Due to the equity side of the bond, which adds value, the coupon payments on the bond are lower for the issuer than a straight coupon-bearing plain vanilla bond, thereby, reducing its debt-financing costs. In addition, a favorable move in the exchange rates can reduce the issuer\u2019s cost of debt, which is the interest payment made on bonds. Since the principal has to be repaid at maturity, an adverse movement in exchange rates in which the local currency weakens can cause cash outflows on repayment to be higher than any savings in interest rates, resulting in losses for the issuer. In addition, issuing bonds in a foreign currency exposes the issuer to any political, economic, and legal risks prevalent in the country. Furthermore, if the issuer\u2019s stock price declines below the conversion price, FCCB investors will not convert their bonds to equity, which means the issuer will have to make the principal repayments at maturity. An FCCB investor can purchase these bonds at a stock exchange, and has the option to convert the bond into equity or a depositary receipt after a certain period of time. Investors can participate in any price appreciation of the issuer\u2019s stock by converting the bond to equity. Bondholders take advantage of this appreciation by means of warrants attached to the bonds, which are activated when the price of the stock reaches a certain point."

General obligation bonds are issued with the belief that a municipality will be able to repay its debt obligation through taxation or revenue from projects. No assets are used as collateral. A GO bond may be contrasted with a revenue bond in the context of munis. A general obligation (GO) bond is secured by an issuing government's pledge to use all available resources \u2014 even tax revenues \u2014 to repay holders of the bond. At the local government level, pledges may include a pledge to levy property taxes to meet the local government's obligation on the bondholders. For example, since property owners avoid losing their stake on their respective properties because of unpaid property tax bills, credit rating agencies rate general obligation pledges with strong credit qualities and assign them high investment-grade ratings. If the property owners are not able to pay their property taxes on or before the designated due date, the government is legally allowed to increase the property tax rate to make up for any delinquencies. On the designated due date, the general obligation pledge requires the local government to cover the debt with its available resources. General obligation bonds also serve as a way for local governments to raise funds for projects that create streams of income for things such as roads, parks, equipment, and bridges. General obligation bonds are usually used to fund government projects that will serve the public community. State law sets the grounds on which local governments can provide and issue general obligation bonds. A general obligation bond may either be a limited-tax general obligation pledge or an unlimited-tax general obligation pledge. A limited-tax general obligation pledge asks the issuing local government to raise property taxes if necessary to meet existing debt service obligations. However, this increase is bound by a statutory limit. With limited-tax general obligation pledges, governments can still use a part of already-levied property taxes, use another stream of income, or raise property taxes to an amount equating to existing debt service payments to answer its debt obligations. An unlimited-tax general obligation pledge is similar to the limited-tax pledge. The only difference is that the local government is asked to increase property tax rates to necessary levels \u2014 up to a maximum of 100% \u2014 to cover delinquencies from taxpayers. Residents must first agree to increase property taxes to the necessary amounts required for the bonds."

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. An emerging market bond exchange-traded fund (ETF) comprises fixed income debt issues from countries with developing economies. These include government bonds and corporate bonds in Asia, Latin America, Africa and elsewhere. Emerging market bonds typically\u00a0offer higher returns than traditional bonds for two primary\u00a0reasons: They tend to be riskier\u00a0than bonds from more developed countries,\u00a0and developing countries tend to grow rapidly. An emerging market ETF allows investors to diversify positions in emerging market bonds like a mutual fund, yet it trades like a stock. If the underlying bonds in the ETF perform well, so too does the ETF (minus the fund\u2019s costs and expenses). Launched with the help of iShares in December 2007, the iShares JPMorgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EMB) tracks the JPMorgan EMBI Global Core Index. EMBI Global Core is a very broad, U.S.-dollar denominated, emerging-markets debt benchmark. Nearly three-quarters of the EMBI Global Core is emerging government debt, with most of the rest focused on high-yielding corporate bonds. iShares.\ufeff\ufeff The iShares JPMorgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF is best suited for investors are looking for a diversified path to high-yielding fixed income.\u00a0The fund has holdings in\u00a050 countries, including\u00a0in allocation in Russia, Mexico, Poland, Hungary, South Africa, and the Philippines. The SPDR Barclays Capital Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF (EBND)\u00a0tracks government debt for emerging market countries.\u00a0It also tracks them in their local currency, which adds volatility and arbitrage opportunities. Although the EBND\u00a0has an exchange rate risk associated with it, the currency conversion\u00a0can be used\u00a0as a hedge against the U.S. dollar while potentially enhancing\u00a0current returns in low rate environments. The returns of EBND should generally correspond to the price and yield performance of its benchmark EM Local Currency Capped Index, minus fees and expenses. The expense ratio is 0.30%.\ufeff\ufeff This ETF is particularly attractive to investors who want exposure to Brazil. An Invesco issue, the Invesco Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt Portfolio (PCY) was established in October 2007. This ETF tracks the DB Emerging Markets USD Liquid Balance Index, which typically has 80% of its underlying assets in dollar-denominated government debt. The tracking function of the DB Emerging Markets USD Liquid Balance Index is somewhat unique. All sovereign debt in the index is chosen through a proprietary index methodology and subsequently measured against the potential returns from a theoretical portfolio. The entire portfolio is rebalanced quarterly.\u00a0The PCY\u00a0ETF has bond holdings in\u00a0more than 20 countries, including Brazil,\u00a0Croatia, Mexico,\u00a0Lithuania, Colombia,\u00a0Poland, and Slovenia.\u00a0\ufeff\ufeff The ETF expense ratio is only 0.50%.\ufeff\ufeff Investors should consider this fund if they want a highly diversified and actively rebalanced portfolio with exposure to emerging market fixed income returns. Vanguard created the Emerging Markets Government Bond ETF (VWOB) to mirror the performance of the Barclays Emerging Markets Government RIC Capped Index. All of the fund\u2019s underlying investments are chosen through a sampling process designed to mirror the holdings and an average maturity of the benchmark. The VWOB ETF is a U.S. dollar-denominated emerging-market debt fund, meaning it avoids any impact from exchange rate risk or currency volatility. The fund\u00a0typically has debt holdings that have\u00a0longer maturities and as a result, are more sensitive to changes in interest rates. The VWOB\u00a0has bond holdings in\u00a0Russia, Mexico, Qatar, Colombia, and Argentina. Like many\u00a0Vanguard ETF offerings, the Emerging Markets Government Bond ETF has a\u00a0low expense ratio of only 0.25%.\ufeff\ufeff The VWOB\u00a0is a good option for investors looking for passively managed exposure to emerging market government debt. Van Eck issued the Market Vectors Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond ETF (EMLC) in 2010. This ETF seeks to capture the returns, before fees and expenses, of the JPMorgan Government Bond Index \u2013 Global Core. The\u00a0EMLC\u00a0ETF provides\u00a0investors with exposure to emerging-market government bonds denominated in local currencies. The EMLC offers diversification away from U.S. debt. However, the fund, which has nearly $3 billion in AUM, is not hedged against currency exchange risk.\ufeff\ufeff The ETF's\u00a0country allocation\u00a0includes Brazil, Thailand,\u00a0Argentina, South Africa, Dominican Republic, and Mexico. The vast majority of the allocation weightings for each country is less than 1%, and the ETF has an expense ratio of 0.36%.\ufeff\ufeff iShares. \"iShares J.P.

            "title": "BND vs. AGG: Comparing Bond ETFs",
            "content": "Bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a useful device for modern fixed-income investors. These ETFs combine the relative stability and portfolio diversification of bond mutual funds with the intra-day liquidity of stocks. The best bond ETFs top it off with a low cost. In terms of assets managed, two of the largest players in the bond ETF space are the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) and the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND). The two funds held greater than $381 billion in total assets under management (AUM), as of September 2023. This level of AUM is greater than other bond ETFs and far outpaces the rest of the investment-grade broad market category. So when it comes to an AGG vs. BND review, which bond ETF is better? AGG is a product of BlackRock Inc. and part of its successful iShares ETF series. It is the older of the two funds by three and one-half years, having launched in September 2003. Backed by all the resources of the world's largest money manager, this ETF doesn't lack for recognition or marketing. Portfolio managers James Mauro and Karen Uyehara were in charge of the ETF's day-to-day operations as of June 2023. Meanwhile, the Total Bond Market ETF is Vanguard's preeminent domestic bond offering. In many ways, the Vanguard fund is a younger brother to the iShares fund. The two ETFs track the same index, albeit with slight variations in execution, and provide healthy competition for low fees, safety, and strong returns. Both funds are passively managed ETFs. Passive investment strategies are designed to reduce total fund costs, making them less expensive investments. Before the BlackRock buyout, AGG was a much more expensive and sluggish fund, but competition has driven costs down sharply for both asset managers. Both ETFs track the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, the leading yardstick for domestic bond performance, though Vanguard's BND follows a float-adjusted version of the index. The Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index is a market value-weighted collection of the whole U.S. bond market, excluding municipal bonds, Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), and high-yield bonds. The Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF has $302.4 billion assets under management as of November 30, 2023, making it comparatively larger compared to the iShares ETF of $97.3 billion AUM as of November 7, 2023. The portfolio for the iShares ETF has a slightly longer average duration, at roughly 6.3 years relative to roughly 5.9 years. Each is very similar in terms of weighted average maturity and yield to maturity (YTM). The two funds show remarkably consistent financial figures. As of December 2023, the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) and Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) both had an expense ratio of 0.03%. They are the two most liquid bond ETFs, moving hundreds of millions of dollars per day in daily trades. As bond-backed funds, the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF and the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF are indirectly exposed to counterparty risks in their underlying portfolios. However, each risk profile is pretty similar. As of November 2023, 3.01% of iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF was in AAA-rated bonds and 72.2% of were in AA-rated bonds. Alternatively, 67% of the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF was in government bonds. Neither bond tends to hold any bond rated less than BBB. Perhaps a larger concern for bond ETFs is inflation risk. Treasury-heavy bond ETFs may or may not have yields that are equal to or higher than inflation. With inflation peaking in 2022 at 9.1%, bond ETFs face the risk that investors will lose purchasing power even when still generating a profit. Interest rate risk is also a problem since the intermediate-term nature of these ETFs makes them more susceptible than shorter-term instruments. As of December 2023, iShares had an average annual return of 1.34% over the past 10 years, compared to Vanguard's of 1.35%. The iShares ETF has tended to be the more expensive fund over that period, so the Vanguard ETF probably demonstrated stronger true performance by a very small margin. Expert opinion is almost universally positive for both funds, though rarely overwhelming. Morningstar awards three stars to each of these ETFs. Because the strategies, portfolios, benchmarks, performances, and costs of the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF and the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF are so similar, there isn't an investor group more suited for one or the other. Generally speaking, either fund can fit as a core holding for retirement-conscious investors or as a satellite for those who want high-grade domestic bond exposure. Low yields and small returns make them ill-suited for younger or more aggressive traders. The expense ratio for both BND and AGG is 0.03%. Both BND and AGG typically pay dividends on a regular schedule. The frequency can vary but is often monthly or quarterly, as the dividends are earned on the underlying bonds which may have varying or changing payment schedules. Tax implications should be a significant consideration for any ETF investments. BND and AGG can produce taxable income from dividends, and you can also be taxed capital gains taxes upon selling shares. This tax may be assessed at a short-term capital gains rate or long-term capital gains rate. . The Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) and the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) are both ETFs designed to provide investors with diversified exposure to the U.S. bond market. Both ETFs offer broad coverage of various bond types, though they do track to different indices. Both BND and AGG are passively managed, typically feature low expense ratios, and very generally have similar performance. iShares. \u201ciShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF.\u201d Vanguard. \u201cTotal Bond Market ETF.\u201d iShares. \u201c2023 Prospectus:\u00a0 iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF.\u201d Pages S-11, S-12.

Bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs), unlike stock ETFs, are fixed-income funds that enable investors to earn a regular income from interest payments. Many bond ETFs focus on municipal, corporate, government, and international debt. Others track benchmarks such as the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Investors may also purchase bond ETFs that have specific ranges of maturity dates. Learn which bond ETFs are among the best funds for rising interest rates and thus worth considering in the market conditions of 2022. The bond market\u2019s outlook in 2022 is changing due to recent and anticipated actions by the Federal Reserve (Fed), the U.S. central bank, as it attempts to control inflation. There are two significant pieces of this strategy: There are 315 bond ETFs that trade in the United States, excluding inverse ETFs, leveraged ETFs, and ETFs with fewer than $50 million in assets under management (AUM). The overall bond market return, as measured by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, has underperformed the broader market over the past 12 months, with a total return of -3.9% compared to the S&P 500\u2019s total return of 28.0% as of Dec. 16, 2021. The best performing bond ETF, based on performance over the past year, is the VanEck CEF Muni Income ETF (XMPT). The top three bond ETS to consider for 2022 are: Below, we\u2019ll look at each of these bond ETFs and evaluate why they might be smart investments for 2022. All numbers below are as of Dec. 19, 2021. XMPT enables investors to access the municipal bond market by replicating as closely as possible the price and performance of the S-Network Municipal Bond Closed-End Fund Index. The benchmark tracks the performance of the U.S.-listed closed-end funds that buy securities in the U.S.-dollar-denominated tax-exempt market. Despite investing in closed-end funds, its approach provides great diversity of exposure in fixed-income securities of varying durations. The ETF offers the potential of a high level of tax-exempt income, and it may generate yields higher than most other fixed-income investments. The fund\u2019s top three holdings are three different bond funds: the Nuveen AMT-Free Municipal Credit Income Fund of Benef Interest (NVG), the Nuveen Quality Municipal Income Fund of Benef Interest (NAD), and the Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund of Benef Interest (NEA). The First Trust Municipal High Income ETF is an actively managed fund that primarily aims to provide federally tax-exempt income to investors. The fund keeps a minimum of 80% of its net assets in municipal debt securities whose interest proceeds are exempt from regular federal income taxes. FMHI\u2019s largest exposure is in debt securities that have a maturity of 15 to 19.99 years. The fund\u2019s top three holdings are Buckeye Ohio Tobacco Settlement 5% due on June 1, 2055; Black Desert PUB Infrastructure Dist UTAH 4% due on March 1, 2051; and Canyon Pines Metropolitan District Co SPL IMPT Dist 1 3.75% due on Dec. 1, 2040. The VanEck Fallen Angel High Yield Bond ETF tracks the price and performance of the ICE U.S. Fallen Angel High Yield 10% Constrained Index. The fund comprises below-investment-grade corporate bonds that were originally issued as investment-grade corporate bonds. At least 80% of ANGL\u2019s assets are invested in securities that make up the fund\u2019s benchmark index. The fund provides fixed-income securities exposure to debt in the United States, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada, and elsewhere. Top holdings include Kraft Heinz Foods Co. (KHC) 4.375% corporate bonds due on June 1, 2046; Sprint Capital Corp. 6.875% corporate bonds due on Nov. 15, 2028; and Sprint Capital 8.75% corporate bonds due on March 15, 2032.

            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. Douglas Rissing / Getty Images Bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a type of exchange-traded fund (ETF) that exclusively invests in bonds. These are similar to bond mutual funds because they hold a portfolio of bonds with different particular strategies\u2014from U.S. Treasuries to high yields\u2014and holding period\u2014between long-term and short-term. Bond ETFs are passively managed and trade, similar to stock ETFs on major stock exchanges. This helps promote market stability by adding liquidity and transparency during times of stress. Investopedia / Yurle Villegas Bond ETFs trade throughout the day on a centralized exchange, unlike individual bonds, which are sold over the counter by bond brokers. The structure of traditional bonds makes it difficult for investors to find a bond with an attractive price. Bond ETFs avoid this issue by trading on major indexes, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). As such, they can provide investors with the opportunity to gain exposure to the bond market with the ease and transparency of stock trading. Bond ETFs are also more liquid than individual bonds and mutual funds, which trade at one price per day after the market closes. And during times of distress, investors can trade a bond portfolio even if the underlying bond market is not functioning well. Bond ETFs pay out interest through a monthly dividend, while any capital gains are paid out through an annual dividend. For tax purposes, these dividends are treated as either income or capital gains. However, the tax efficiency of bond ETFs is not a big factor, because capital gains do not play as big a part in bond returns as they do in stock returns. In addition, bond ETFs are available on a global basis. Both bond mutual funds and bond ETFs have similarities, but the holdings within the funds and the fees charged to investors can vary. U.S. bond ETFs experienced a record-breaking year in 2020. U.S. bond ETFs generated $168 billion in 2020. In October 2019, global bond ETF assets under management topped $1 trillion, and as of June 2023, bond ETFs are one of the fast-growing categories in asset management, at $206 trillion. Various ETFs exist for the various subsectors. Some examples include: Investors who are unsure of what type to invest in should consider total bond-market ETFs, which invest in the entire U.S. bond market. Bond ETFs offer many of the same features of an individual bond, including a regular coupon payment. One of the most significant benefits of owning bonds is the chance to receive fixed payments on a regular schedule. These payments traditionally happen every six months. Bond ETFs, in contrast, hold assets with different maturity dates. So, at any given time, some bonds in the portfolio may be due for a coupon payment. For this reason, bond ETFs pay interest each month, with the value of the coupon varying from month to month. Assets in the fund are continually changing and do not mature. Instead, bonds are bought and sold as they expire or exit the target age range of the fund. The challenge for the architect of a bond ETF is to ensure that it closely tracks its respective index in a cost-effective manner, despite the lack of liquidity in the bond market. Most bonds are held until maturity, so an active secondary market is typically not available for them. This makes it difficult to ensure a bond ETF encompasses enough liquid bonds to track an index. This challenge is bigger for corporate bonds than for government bonds. The suppliers of bond ETFs get around the liquidity problem by using representative sampling, which simply means tracking only a sufficient number of bonds to represent an index. The bonds used in the representative sample tend to be the largest and most liquid in the index. Given the liquidity of government bonds, tracking errors will be less of a problem with ETFs that represent government bond indices. Bond ETFs are a great option to gain exposure to the bond market, but there are some glaring limitations. For one thing, an investor's initial investment is at greater risk in an ETF than an individual bond. Since a bond ETF never matures, there isn't a guarantee the principal will be repaid in full. Furthermore, when interest rates rise, it tends to harm the price of the ETF, like an individual bond. As the ETF does not mature, however, it's difficult to mitigate interest rate risk. The decision over whether to purchase a bond fund or a bond ETF usually depends on the investment objective of the investor. If you want active management, bond mutual funds offer more choices. If you plan to buy and sell frequently, bond ETFs are a good choice. For the long term, buy-and-hold investors, bond mutual funds, and bond ETFs can meet your needs, but it's best to do your research as to the holdings in each fund. If transparency is important, bond ETFs allow you to see the holdings within the fund at any given moment. However, if you're concerned about not being able to sell your ETF investment due to the lack of buyers in the market, a bond fund might be a better choice since you'll be able to sell your holdings back to the fund issuer. As with most investment decisions, it's important to do your research, speak with your broker or financial advisor. The liquidity and transparency of an ETF offer advantages over a passively held bond ladder. Bond ETFs offer instant diversification and a constant duration, which means an investor needs to make only one trade to get a fixed-income portfolio up and running. A bond ladder, which requires buying individual bonds, does not offer this luxury. One disadvantage of bond ETFs is that they charge an ongoing management fee. While lower spreads on trading bond ETFs help offset this somewhat, the issue will still prevail with a buy-and-hold strategy over the longer term. The initial trading spread advantage of bond ETFs is eroded over time by the annual management fee. The second disadvantage is that there is no flexibility to create something unique for a portfolio. For example, if an investor is looking for a high degree of income or no immediate income at all, bond ETFs may not be the appropriate product. No. ETFs are pooled investments that invest in a range of securities. Investors can buy and sell ETFs like shares of stock on exchanges, and bond ETFs will track the prices of the bond portfolio that it represents. Most investors should have some funds allocated to bonds. Bond ETFs tend to be more liquid and cost-effective than bond mutual funds, and offer diversified bond holdings across a range of bond types, from U.S. Treasuries to junk bonds. Bond ETFs pay dividends on a monthly basis based on the interest income earned on the bonds held in the fund's portfolio. A ladder strategy uses bonds of different maturities to reduce interest rate risk. This can be done with individual bonds, but also with bond ETFs of different duration.

            "content": "BATEX, MDYHX, THYTX, DVHIX, and TXRAX are the best municipal bond funds for 2022 Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. For individual investors seeking tax-advantaged investment strategies in the fixed-income space, municipal bonds offer an attractive solution. Municipal bonds, also known as \u201cmunis,\u201d are debt securities issued by government entities that provide modest returns by way of interest payments over the duration of the bonds. The interest received on a municipal bond is generally exempt from federal tax, and in some cases, state and city taxes as well. Individual investors may either purchase municipal bonds individually through the entity issuing the security or use a pooled investment strategy such as a mutual fund to gain more exposure to multiple municipal bond issues. We look at the top five municipal bond funds as ranked by each\u2019s one-year trailing total return (TTM) as of the close of markets on Dec. 10, 2021. The funds were selected from a group of funds that are open to new investors, require a minimum initial investment of $1,000 at most, and have assets under management (AUM) of at least $50 million. The first four funds all fall under Morningstar\u2019s \u201cHigh Yield Muni\u201d category, which had an average total return of 6.0% over the past year. The last fund belongs to the \u201cMuni National Intermediate\u201d category, which provided a total return of 1.9% over the same period. All data below is as of Dec. 10, 2021. BATEX is managed by Theodore R. Jaeckel, Walter O\u2019Connor, and Michael Perilli. The fund\u2019s primary objective is to maximize federal tax-free yield, which it aims to achieve by investing in a combination of investment grade and non-investment grade municipal bonds. Its secondary goal is focused on total return. More than half of BATEX\u2019s bond holdings are either not rated or have a credit rating of BB, which is just below investment grade. Most of the fund\u2019s holdings have a maturity of 20 years or more. BATEX has an effective duration of approximately 8.5 years. BATEX\u2019s top three holdings are bonds issued by the Tobacco Settlement Financing Authority of Buckeye, Ohio; the city of Reno, Nev.; and the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authority. Like BATEX, MDYHX is also managed by Jaeckel, O\u2019Connor, and Perilli. The fund attempts to achieve attractive, tax-advantaged income through exposure to high-income and low-volatility holdings. MDYHX invests at least 80% of its assets in munis. At least 65% of its net assets are invested in medium- to low-quality bonds. The majority of its bond holdings have a maturity of at least 20 years. The fund has an effective duration of approximately 7.8 years. MDYHX\u2019s top three holdings are bonds issued by the Washington State Housing Finance Commission, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Arkansas Development Finance Authority. THYTX is managed by Matthew Dalton and Max Christiana. The fund aims to maximize total return by investing in medium- and lower-grade munis that are exempt from federal income tax. The majority of THYTX\u2019s holdings have a credit rating of either BBB or BB or are not rated. Most of the bonds in the portfolio have a maturity of 20 years or more. The fund has an effective duration of approximately 4.9 years. THYTX\u2019s top three holdings are bonds issued by the Tobacco Settlement Financing Authority of Buckeye, Ohio; the Development Authority of LaGrange, Ga.; and the Virginia Small Business Financing Authority. DVHIX is managed by Stephen J. Czepiel, Gregory A. Gizzi, and Jake van Roden. The fund aims to maximize income that is exempt from federal income tax by primarily investing in munis of medium- and lower-grade credit quality. The majority of DVHIX\u2019s bond holdings are not rated. Its next largest exposure is to munis with a BBB credit rating, followed by BB and AAA munis. Most of the fund\u2019s holdings have a maturity of at least 20 years. DVHIX has an effective duration of approximately 8.1 years. DVHIX\u2019s top three holdings are bonds issued by the Tobacco Settlement Financing Authority of Buckeye, Ohio; the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corp.; and the University of Texas. TXRAX is managed by Richard D. Taormina and David P. Rooney. The fund primarily invests in munis whose interest payments are exempt from federal income taxes. It also uses inflation swap contracts to minimize the impact of inflation. TXRAX\u2019s largest exposure is in municipal bonds with a AA credit rating, followed by munis with A and AAA credit ratings. The majority of its bond holdings have a maturity from five to 15 years. TXRAX has an effective duration of approximately 3.5 years. TXRAX\u2019s top three holdings are bonds issued by the state of California, the Tennessee Energy Acquisition Corp., and the Water & Sewer System of Houston, Texas.

            "title": "5 Inverse-Bond ETFs",
            "content": "These ETFs Rise Along with Interest Rates The exchange traded fund (ETF) industry celebrates its 30-year anniversary in 2023. The first ETF was rolled out in January 1993. The SPDR Trust, also referred to as the SPDR S&P500 ETF (ARCA:SPY), was launched with $500 million in assets and simply tracked the S&P 500 index. As of Q2 2023, the SPY ETF trust managed an extraordinary $370 billion in assets. Over the past three decades, ETF offerings have increased in terms of scope and sophistication. Today, there is something of a race to introduce newer, more unique and more complex ETFs to a wider range of investors, including inverse ETFs that allow investors to invest in asset classes other than stocks, and to benefit from when an asset class declines in value. One such class of ETF is the inverse bond ETF. These include securities that allow investors to profit from increasing interest rates, which hurts bond prices because the two move in opposite directions. Below are five such ETFs that effectively let the investor go short different segments of the bond market. The ProShares Short 20+ Year Treasury (ARCA:TBF) seeks to match the inverse of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury Bond market. The underlying index invests in Treasury securities with maturity dates greater than 20 years. Because of the correlation between bond prices and yield, the ETF hasn't performed well at all over the past five years, which is due to the simple fact that bond yields have been falling over that period. However, as rates have ticked up over the past several months, the ETF has risen in value from around $15 in 2021 to over $21 per share as of April 2023. The expense ratio is rather lofty for an ETF at 90 basis points (BPS), or 0.90%. However, it is fairly liquid with nearly $209 million in assets. If longer-term rates continue to increase, the fund would continue its run and likely also pick up additional assets. Investors that are bearish on the outlook for bonds will have to make a decision on how far out they want to go on the maturity scale. ProShares also offers a more medium-term maturity inverse fund in the form of its ProShares Short 7-10 Year Treasury (ARCA:TBX). It seeks to match the inverse of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. 7-10 Year Treasury Bond Index. Expenses are relatively again high at 0.95% and it has only been around since April 2011. Its assets under management are also quite small at $43 million as of April 2023. The ProShares Short High Yield (ARCA: SJB) seeks the inverse of the daily price performance of the Markit iBoxx $ Liquid High Yield Index. Investors may have noticed that high-yield bonds, also known as \"junk bonds,\" can be attractive to some investors to boost the overall yield in their portfolios. A collapse in junk bond prices would do wonders for this ETF. SJB's expense ratio is 0.95% and the fund holds around $273 million AUM as of April 2023. The Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bear 3x ETF (ARCA:TMV) offers bond buyers opportunity to wager big on a rise in interest rates or significant drop in demand for Treasury Bond buying. The ETF seeks a 300% inverse benefit from the NYSE/ICE 20 Year Plus Treasury Bond Index. So when 20-year bond prices falls by 1%, this ETF should rise by 3% (and when the index rises 1% the ETF loses 3%). This is because TMV is an inverse leveraged ETF, which amplifies its returns by a multiple of the index's actual returns. The expense ratio is again high for an ETF at 1.01%, but the fund is so volatile that a 1% drag on profits or additional cost might actually be less significant for traders. But leveraged ETFs like TMV (especially those with negative 3x leverage) are intended only to be held for very short holding periods such as intraday. ProShares UltraPro Short 20+ Year Treasury (ARCA:TBT) is similar to TMV but offers negative 2x the return of 20-year U.S. Treasuries based on the same bond index. TBT has a 0.90% expense ratio, and like other leveraged ETFs is intended only for intraday trading and not for longer holding periods. Inverse bond ETFs are exchange-traded funds that provide investors with the ability to benefit from a decline in bond prices caused by rising interest rates. These ETFs use a variety of investment strategies to achieve inverse returns, including shorting bond futures, owning put options on bonds, or holding short positions directly in bonds. Inverse bond ETFs are complex financial products that carry a range of risks that investors should be aware of. These risks include the possibility of significant losses due to market volatility, leverage, and liquidity issues. The largest risk with inverse bond ETFs is that bond prices rally during a falling interest rate environment. Inverse leveraged ETFs are designed to provide returns that are amplified in the opposite direction to their benchmark indices over a single trading day, which means that they are not suitable for long-term investors. Investors should carefully consider their investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon before investing in any of these complex products. The reason why bonds prices drop when interest rates go up is that most bonds are fixed-income investments that pay a fixed interest rate to investors over the bond's life. If interest rates rise after a bond is issued, newer bonds will offer relatively higher interest rates, making the older bonds with lower interest rates less attractive to investors. As a result, the prices of these older bonds will have to fall in order to make them more attractive to investors. Conversely, if interest rates fall, existing bonds with higher interest rates would become more attractive to investors, causing their prices to rise in the market. Yes. Investing in inverse bond ETFs can have tax implications for investors, including short-term capital gains taxes that are triggered by selling shares of the ETF for a profit within one year of purchase. Investors should also be aware of the potential for tax inefficiency inside of inverse ETFs, which can result from the fund's use of derivatives and other even more complex investment strategies over longer holding periods. It's recommended that investors consult with an accountant or tax advisor before investing heavily in inverse bond ETFs. Inverse bond ETFs allow investors to profit from declining bond prices caused by increasing interest rates. These ETFs use a variety of underlying indices that cover various segments of the bond market from U.S. Treasuries to high yield corporate bonds, which deliver inverse returns that can help investors protect their portfolios against interest rate risk and to profit from a rising interest rate environment. Some inverse bond ETFs also use leverage to amplify their returns, but these are intended only for short holding periods, such as intraday trading. It's important for investors to carefully consider the expense ratios, risks, and other factors associated with inverse bond ETFs before investing in them. At the time of writing, author Ryan C.

            "title": "Everything You Need to Know About Junk Bonds",
            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Like any bond, a junk bond is an investment in debt. A company or a government raises a sum of money by issuing IOUs stating the amount it is borrowing (the principal), the date it will return your money (maturity date), and the interest rate (coupon) it will pay you on the borrowed money. The interest rate is the profit the investor will make for lending the money. Before it is issued, every bond is rated by Standard & Poor's or Moody's, the major rating agencies that are tasked with determining the financial ability of the issuer to repay the debt it is taking on. The ratings range from AAA (the best) to D (the company is in default). The two agencies have slightly different labeling conventions. AAA from Standard & Poor's, for example, is Aaa from Moody's. Broadly speaking, all bonds can be placed in one of two categories: Think of a bond rating as the report card for a company's credit rating. Blue-chip firms with solid financials and steady income will get a high rating for their bonds. Riskier companies and government bodies with rocky financial histories will get a lower rating. The chart below shows the bond-rating scales from the two major rating agencies. Image by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02020 Historically, average yields on junk bonds have been 4% to 6% above those for comparable U.S. Treasuries. U.S. bonds are generally considered the standard for investment-grade bonds because the nation has never defaulted on a debt. Bond investors break down junk bonds into two broad categories: The obvious caveat is that junk bonds are a high-risk investment. There's a risk that the issuer will file for bankruptcy and you'll never get your money back. There is a market for junk bonds, but it is overwhelmingly dominated by institutional investors who can hire analysts with knowledge of specialized credit. This does not mean that junk-bond investing is strictly for the wealthy. For individual investors who are interested in junk bonds, investing in a high-yield bond fund can make sense. You're dabbling in a higher-risk investment, but you're relying on the skills of professional money managers to make the picks. High-yield bond funds also lower the overall risk to the investor by diversifying their portfolios across asset types. The Fidelity Capital and Income Fund (FAGIX) keeps nearly 12.65% of its money in stocks as of June 30, 2023. You need to know how long you can commit your cash before you decide to buy a junk bond fund. Many do not allow investors to cash out for at least one or two years. There is a point at which the rewards of junk bonds don't justify the risks. You can determine this by looking at the yield spread between junk bonds and U.S. Treasuries. The yield on junk is historically 4% to 6% above U.S. Treasuries. If you see the yield spread shrinking below 4%, it's probably not worth the added risk to invest in junk bonds. As of July 31, 2023, the spread is 3.79%. One more thing to look for is the default rate on junk bonds. This can be tracked on Moody's website. One final warning: Junk bonds follow boom and bust cycles, just like stocks. In the 1980s and 1990s, investment grade bonds earned upwards of 15% and 20% annually depending on the specific year; however, a flood of defaults can cause these funds to produce stunning negative returns. The simple reason to buy a junk bond is for higher returns. Junk bonds are risky assets but due to their high risk, they come with returns that are higher than safer, investment-grade bonds. Investors willing to take on higher risk for higher returns would buy junk bonds. The primary disadvantage of a junk bond is the issuer defaulting on the bond. Junk bonds are issued by companies or countries that are low-rated. There is a high chance that the issuer may not be able to make the interest payments on the bond or that they may go bankrupt and not only not make payments but not repurchase the bond at maturity. Junk bonds are bonds that have a rating of BB or lower by S&P or Ba and lower by Moody's. Any bonds with these ratings are junk bonds. Junk bonds are low-rated bonds due to the increased risk that there will be a default on the bond, meaning the bond issuer may not be able to make the interest payments or buy back the bond at maturity. In order to entice investors to buy junk bonds, the interest/return on the bond is much higher than better-rated bonds. Investors seeking higher returns may do well investing in junk bonds but should be mindful of the higher risk. Investopedia does not provide investment advice.

            "title": "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: An Overview",
            "content": "How they help the mortgage market and provide crisis relief The Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly known as \"Fannie Mae,\" and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, \"Freddie Mac,\" are the two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) chartered by the U.S. Congress in 1938. Neither originates or services its own mortgages. Instead, they buy and guarantee mortgages issued through lenders in the secondary mortgage market. Their influence over the U.S. real estate market is hard to overstate. The names Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rarely surface on investing sites or financial news headlines. Yet, these enterprises have been the pillars on which the American housing market of the last 80 years has largely been built. Their sway lies in securitizing loans, effectively transforming individual mortgages into tradable bonds. This constant flow of capital allows lenders to extend more credit, ultimately shaping interest rates and making homeownership accessible to millions of Americans. Here's a look at how they work, their roles in the 2008 financial crisis, their work for renters and homeowners during the COVID-19 pandemic, and their prospects in the years ahead. In the early 20th century, homeownership was out of reach for most people in the U.S.. Unless you could pay cash for an entire home (which few people could), you were looking at a prohibitively large down payment and a short-term loan, culminating in a big balloon payment. Even if you could buy a home during the Great Depression, you might have been among the nearly one in four homeowners who lost their homes to foreclosure. The banks also had no money to lend, and the nation faced a housing crisis. The U.S. Congress responded in 1938 with the National Housing Act, creating the Federal National Mortgage Association, better known as Fannie Mae from its acronym, FNMA, to supply reliable, steady funding for housing. It brought a new type of mortgage to the market: the long-term, fixed-rate loan with an option to refinance anytime. This has become the primary way many Americans buy their first homes. Fannie Mae initially bought mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and later added loans guaranteed by the Veterans Administration (VA), later called Veterans Affairs. The Johnson administration privatized Fannie Mae in 1968, making it a shareholder-owned company funded entirely with private capital. This would have significant effects later on, but it resulted from a budget gimmick: Starting in 1965, Fannie Mae was growing more rapidly. This might have been good for homeowners able to buy homes at the time but bad for the Johnson presidential administration: an accounting quirk meant that Fannie Mae's mortgages were added to the annual budget expenditures, thus increasing the budget deficit. Two years later, Fannie Mae was authorized to buy conventional mortgages in addition to FHA and VA loans. The agency began issuing mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in the 1980s to offer more liquidity in the mortgage investment market. The money to buy mortgage-related assets came from issuing debt securities offered in the U.S. and international capital markets. For decades, Fannie Mae would be the main buyer and seller of government-insured mortgages. Freddie Mac is the unofficial name of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. It was established in 1970 under the Emergency Home Finance Act to expand the secondary mortgage market and reduce interest rate risk for banks. In 1989, it was reorganized as a shareholder-owned company as part of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act. Freddie Mac's charter is like Fannie Mae's. It was meant to expand the secondary mortgage market and MBS by buying loans made by banks, savings and loans, and other lending institutions. But unlike Fannie Mae, which buys mortgages from major retail and commercial banks, Freddie Mac buys its loans from smaller banks, such as thrift banks, that focus on providing banking services to underserved communities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have similar charters, mandates, and regulatory structures. Each buys mortgages from lenders to hold in their portfolios or repackage as MBS that can be sold. In turn, lenders use the money from selling the mortgages to originate more loans. This helps individuals and families access a continuous and stable supply of mortgage funding. According to their charters, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \"establish secondary market facilities for residential mortgages [and] provide that the operations thereof shall be financed by private capital to the maximum extent feasible.\" Both entities are mandated to do the following: Fannie Mae has one additional responsibility according to its charter: to manage and liquidate federally owned mortgage portfolios to minimize adverse effects on the residential mortgage market and minimize potential losses to the federal government. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's congressional\u00a0charters made them Government Sponsored Enterprises GSEs. Though private, they had ties to the U.S. federal government that was thought to provide a financial backstop, with a line of credit from the U.S. Treasury for $2.25 billion. In September 2008, during the height of the financial crisis, they were placed under the direct supervision of the federal government. During regular times, the government ties were less apparent but nonetheless important. Each was a unique company unlike any other in the U.S. Here are some of the differences: The FHFA regulates, enforces, and monitors Fannie and Freddie's capital standards and limits the size of their mortgage investment portfolios. HUD oversees Fannie and Freddie's general housing missions. Mortgage lending discrimination is illegal. If you think you've been discriminated against based on race, religion, sex, marital status, use of public assistance, national origin, disability, or age, there are steps you can take. One such step is to file a report with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or with HUD. Fannie and Freddie's GSE status created perceptions in the market that its securities were safe. It was widely said that the federal government would step in and bail out these organizations if either firm ever ran into financial trouble, as was seen in the lead-up to the Great Recession. This is known as an implicit guarantee. Given the market's faith in this implicit guarantee, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were allowed to borrow money in the bond market at lower\u00a0yields\u00a0than other financial institutions could. The yield on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's corporate debt, known as\u00a0agency debt, has historically been about 35\u00a0basis points\u00a0higher than U.S. Treasury bonds. AAA-rated financial firm debt, by comparison, has historically yielded about 70 basis points more than U.S. Treasury bonds. While 35 basis points may not seem like much, it made a huge difference, given the trillions of dollars involved. In the 1980s, a crisis that hit the savings and loan industry shrunk that sector's part in the real estate market significantly. By the 1990s, computerization enabled far more efficient and faster processing of mortgage applications and MBSs. These, along with other industry changes, meant that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac expanded significantly throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. During this period, there was a frequent debate about Fannie and Freddie and their holdings among economists, financial market professionals, and government officials. Even without some analysts' concerns over their ballooning balance sheets, Fannie and Freddie were facing regulatory scrutiny in the early 2000s. An investigation by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, the independent agency overseeing the companies, exposed widespread accounting irregularities that made their operations \"unsafe and unsound.\" Both entities, it turns out, were using accounting strategies that delayed accounting for expenses and inflated their income. This allowed them to present steady quarterly profit growth\u2014\"smooth over\" in the wording one executive used\u2014reassuring investors. The tactics often involved the complex timing of derivative contracts. When their misaligned balance sheets finally surfaced, executives at both firms were forced out, years of annual earnings reports had to be resubmitted and billions in losses had to be accounted for, and millions in fines were to be paid. In 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began to take on massive losses on their retained portfolios, especially on their\u00a0Alt-A\u00a0and subprime investments. In 2008, the sheer size of their retained portfolios and mortgage guarantees led the FHFA (and everyone else in the market) to conclude that they would soon be\u00a0insolvent. On March 19 of that year, federal regulators allowed the two firms to take on another $200 billion in debt, hoping to stabilize them and the wider economy. However, by Sept. 6, 2008, it was clear that the market believed the firms were in financial trouble, and the FHFA put the companies into conservatorship. They received $190 billion in bailout funding, which was paid back by 2014. Nevertheless, they remain in conservatorship under the FHFA. Under the conservatorship agreements established during the 2008-09 financial crisis, Fannie and Freddie were required to send most of their profits to the Treasury as repayment for being bailed out, preventing them from rebuilding their capital reserves. In 2019, however, new rules were enacted that permit Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to keep a combined $45 billion in earnings. (This was later increased.) This was seen as an initial step in a broader effort to reform the housing finance system, including ending the government's control over these entities. Through Dec. 31, 2019, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had repaid the Treasury a total of $301\u00a0billion in dividends during their conservatorship. Since then, each has been building its capital reserves. In mid-February 2024, Fannie Mae reported that its 2023 year-end net worth was $77.7 billion, with a net income of $17.4 billion for the year. Freddie Mac, for its part, reported its net worth at $47.7 billion, with a net income of $10.5 billion in 2023. In September 2019, the U.S. Treasury and FHFA announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could start keeping their earnings to build up their capital reserves. The move was a step toward transitioning the two out of conservatorship. In early 2024, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had net worths of $77.7 billion and $47.7 billion, respectively. The federal government initiated emergency measures during the COVID-19 pandemic to help individuals and families meet their mortgage or rent obligations. Most relevant here is the CARES Act, which introduced protections for homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The legislation barred lenders and loan servicers from initiating or concluding foreclosures, ultimately expiring on July 31, 2021. For those directly facing financial hardship because of the pandemic, the CARES Act also made it possible to request a mortgage forbearance on Fannie and Freddie loans for up to 180 days, with an option to extend for another 180 days. The forbearance plan lowered or suspended mortgage payments for up to 12 months without late fees or penalties. After the forbearance period, repayment options included plans to catch up gradually or via a loan modification plan to maintain a lower monthly payment. Fannie Mae offered an additional program, the Disaster Response Network, that assisted with some of the broader financial effects of the pandemic. The network provided access to HUD-approved housing counselors for homeowners with Fannie Mae-owned loans and renters in Fannie Mae-financed properties. The counselors provided advice, personalized plans, financial coaching and budgeting, and support for up to 18 months. The FHFA also established more lenient lending and appraisal standards during the pandemic. These adjustments ensured homebuyers could proceed with loan applications and closings while adhering to social distancing guidelines and lockdowns. The financial toll of the pandemic on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was significant, as these agencies provided vast liquidity to the mortgage and rental markets. Fannie Mae saw its net income decline by over 20% between 2019 and 2020, and Freddie Mac saw a drop of over 17%. However, both GSEs saw their post-pandemic income increase and their balance sheets stabilized, despite the high interest rates that dampened the real estate market after 2022. Forbearance does not equal forgiveness. Mortgage servicers may have various post-forbearance options. Be wary if the option is a balloon payment rather than simply adding the unpaid months to the end of your mortgage. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are both GSEs that buy and guarantee mortgages, allowing lenders to free up capital to issue new loans. There are some differences, however. Fannie Mae is publicly traded, while private shareholders own Freddie Mac. Fannie Mae tends to focus more on single-family mortgages; Freddie Mac historically has financed larger multifamily holdings. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a pivotal role in the U.S. housing market by increasing the liquidity of mortgage capital, which in turn helps lower the cost of borrowing for homebuyers. They purchase mortgages from lenders and either hold these mortgages in their portfolios or package them into mortgage-backed securities that are sold to investors. In 2023 alone, Fannie and Freddie bought loans that financed 805,000 and 955,000 single-family homes, respectively. By providing lenders with the assurance that their loans can be sold, these entities enable lenders to offer more mortgages at more favorable terms to a broader spectrum of borrowers, including those with lower down payments or otherwise underserved in the market. Those who advocate privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac argue that it would cut government risk and encourage more competition and efficiency within the mortgage market. They say that privatization could lead to a more sustainable housing finance system by limiting taxpayers' exposure to potential losses. However, opponents fear that privatization could lead to higher mortgage rates, less support for affordable housing, and increased market volatility. They argue that the government's role is crucial in ensuring stability and accessibility in the housing market, especially during economic downturns. No, but it was a close call. The 2008 housing crash left Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the verge of bankruptcy, so they were put into government conservatorship. They received huge bailouts, which they have since paid back, but they remain under conservatorship today. There have been various proposals to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with goals ranging from winding down their operations to making them fully private again. However, major reform legislation has stalled in Congress so far. Any changes to Fannie and Freddie center on ending their conservatorship and ensuring they work in a sound manner that promotes a stable and liquid mortgage market. Proposals include strengthening their capital reserves to withstand a future housing recession, reducing their market footprint to encourage more private capital in the mortgage market, and supporting more affordable housing. However, the exact path of these reforms is subject to extensive debate among policymakers, industry stakeholders, and consumer and community advocates, reflecting the complex role these entities play in the U.S. housing system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are charged with bolstering the U.S. mortgage market to provide housing loans to middle America. Both buy mortgages from various lenders, which helps maintain a steady and reliable source of mortgage funding for individuals, families, and investors. This has meant providing liquidity and stabilization efforts, with the federal government's help, during crises like the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023 alone, they combined to purchase 1.76 million single-family home mortgages. Without Fannie and Freddie, the availability and affordability of mortgage credit would be significantly reduced. Interest rates for homebuyers would likely increase, debt financing would be more difficult for banks and lenders to obtain, and the homeownership rate could decline considerably. Their operations support the broader housing market and the wider economy. Maintaining that access and liquidity for qualified borrowers through future market downturns will remain crucial for many Americans.

            "title": "Prime Credit: What It Means, How It Works",
            "content": "Prime credit refers to a credit score that is one level below super prime, the highest credit rating. Consumers with prime credit have very good credit and pose little risk to lenders and creditors. Lenders and credit card companies offer some of their top loans and cards with the lowest interest rates and best terms to consumers with prime credit. Although each of the three main credit bureaus\u2014Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion\u2014have the same overall range of credit scores (300 to 850), the credit score range that is considered prime may vary. Consumers with scores at the highest end of these ranges are considered to have super-prime credit, and consumers whose scores fall just below that range are considered to have prime credit. Below that comes near-prime and sub-prime, the lowest score with the least advantageous terms when it comes to loans. Although the credit bureaus have four defined ranges, the financial institutions that are the end-users may have different categories for their internal models. For example, a bank may give the best financing for car loans to anyone qualifying as a prime borrower rather than having separate terms for super-prime borrowers. Borrowers with prime credit can expect to pay slightly higher interest rates than borrowers with super-prime credit since they are considered to have a slightly higher risk of defaulting on their loans. For example, having a prime credit score might mean paying 1% more on an auto loan than a borrower with a super-prime credit score. Having prime credit usually means you can get a new loan and retain access to your existing credit lines even when the overall credit market is tight. Even in a strong economy where credit is readily available, prime and super-prime borrowers receive most of the credit that banks issue. Your credit rating and classification could differ depending on the company and what bureaus they use to assess your credit score. If you apply for a loan with several different companies, you might be surprised to find that some classify you as having prime credit while others classify you as having super-prime credit. Or, if your score is toward the lower end of the prime range, you might find that some lenders classify you as having prime credit while others classify you as having near-prime credit. Because your credit file with each bureau may contain slightly different information, the score range you fall into with each bureau could be different, and lenders might offer you different rates depending on which bureau they pull your credit score from. No matter the source lenders pull from, keeping control of your debt accounts and making regular payments will help to improve your current credit score."

Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master's in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology. He is a CFA charterholder as well as holding FINRA Series 7, 55 & 63 licenses. He currently researches and teaches economic sociology and the social studies of finance at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. In financial markets, decoupling occurs when the returns of one asset class diverge from their expected or normal pattern of correlation with others. Decoupling thus takes place when different asset classes that typically rise and fall together start to move in opposite directions, such as one increasing and the other decreasing. One example might be seen with oil and natural gas prices, which typically rise and fall together. Decoupling would happen if oil moves in one direction while natural gas moves in the opposite direction. In the investment realm, investors and portfolio managers usually use a statistical measure known as correlation to determine the relationship between two assets or more. The strength of the correlation between two assets depends on where the metric falls within the range of -1 to +1, where a higher number denotes a stronger sync between the investments being compared. A correlation of -1.0 implies that the assets move in the opposite direction, and +1.0 means that the assets will always move in the same direction. By understanding which assets are correlated, portfolio managers and investors create diversified portfolios by allocating investments that are not correlated with each other. This way, when one asset value falls, the other investments in the portfolio don\u2019t have to follow the same path. Stocks in the same industry will usually have a high positive correlation, and a fall in one company's share price will be accompanied by falls in others. For example, in 2017, Goldman Sachs released a report comparing the contemporary tech sector to the tech bubble of the late '90s. According to that report, the 2017 market was dominated the five FAAMG stocks\u2014Facebook (now Meta), Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google (Alphabet)\u2014in a manner similar to the technology market just prior to the dotcom bubble. The report resulted in a sell-off that led to a fall in the stock price of most tech companies in the U.S. market. Since the entire tech sector was affected, the collective plunge seemed to confirm that these companies were highly coupled\u2013a drop in one stock price meant a drop in all of them. Conversely, decoupling occurs when the correlations between closely-linked investments or commodities decrease. For example, gold prices are usually closely linked to the stock prices of mining companies. If negative news is published that causes gold prices to fall, but mining shares to increase, that would be evidence that gold mining companies were decoupling from the price of gold. In effect, decoupling refers to a decrease in correlation. Markets and economies that once moved together can also be decoupled. The financial crisis of 2008 that started in the U.S. economy eventually spread to most markets in the world, leading to a global recession. Since the markets are \"coupled\" with the U.S. economic growth, any market that moves opposite to the global trajectory is known as a decoupled market or economy. In the aftermath of the recession, the concept that the world's emerging markets no longer need to depend on U.S. demand to drive economic growth is an example of economic decoupling. Whereas emerging markets at one point relied on the U.S. economy, many analysts now argue that some emerging markets, such as China, India, Russia, and Brazil, have become sizable markets on their own for goods and services. The argument for decoupling indicates that these economies would be able to withstand a faltering U.S. economy. China, for example, gets almost 70% of its foreign direct investment (FDI) from other emerging countries in Asia and is also investing heavily in commodity-producing companies in its continent. By racking up its foreign exchange reserves and maintaining a current account surplus, the country has room to run a fiscal stimulus if a global downturn occurs, thereby decoupling itself from the advanced markets. In contrast to decoupling, recoupling describes a situation of increasing correlation between two assets or markets, usually after a period of temporary decoupling. This might occur due to technological innovations that reduce the dependence of one factor on another. Another example might be found in the relationship between natural gas prices and crude oil, two fossil fuels that play a key role in many industries. Between 1997 and 2009, the Henry Hub Natural Gas spot price closely tracked changes in West Texas Intermediate (WTI), with only brief deviations. Those prices then started decoupling, most likely due to technological innovations that greatly increased the available supply of natural gas. In later years, the price of crude rose sharply, while natural gas prices remained low. They began to recouple starting in 2015, when crude prices fell and once again began to track the price of natural gas. The two fuels are once again positively correlated, although the price is lower than it was prior to 2009. Decoupling can also refer to the relationships between non-economic factors, such as education, health, and human development. A major goal of environmental economists is to decouple productive activity from environmental pressures\u2014in other words, to achieve productive activity without causing environmental damage. Absolute decoupling is when two variables stop moving together\u2014the correlation between them becomes zero, or negative. Relative decoupling is when the correlation between two variables decreases, but remains positive. Economists also distinguish between different degrees of decoupling, depending on the extent to which the correlation decreases. Absolute decoupling refers to circumstances in which two variables cease to move in the same direction\u2013in other words, where the correlation between the two factors falls to zero or lower. Relative decoupling refers to a partial decoupling, where the two factors continue to have a positive (but lower) correlation. A complex market economy has many moving parts, and many of them move together. Decoupling is one of many economic terms used to describe the changing relationships between economic indicators, stock prices, and other features of the world economy. The economies of China and the United States are closely linked, thanks to the formers' importance as a manufacturing hub and the latter's importance in the world financial system. This close relationship can sometimes have negative consequences, as a disruption in one country can cause a market downturn in the other. For this reason, some politicians have advocated policies that would decouple the two economies by favoring local industries. In logistics, the customer order decoupling point is a link in the supply chain where information from individual customer orders enters the production and distribution process. Prior to the customer order decoupling point, production decisions are typically aggregated, based on historical data and forecasts of consumer demand. After the decoupling point, individual data and customer orders are introduced to increase efficiency in allocations. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are a group of long-term projects seeking to reduce economic reliance on environmentally destructive or harmful industrial practices. This includes several provisions for \"decoupling growth from resource generation,\" i.e., exploring ways to achieve economic growth that do not deplete natural resources or cause environmental pressures. In energy regulation, decoupling is a rate adjustment mechanism that changes the relationship between a utility's revenue and the amount of income it sells to the public. This reduces the utility's incentive to increase sales as a method of raising revenue, thereby reducing the volatility of consumer energy bills.

            "title": "Bond ETFs: A Viable Alternative",
            "content": "While some electronic bond trading is available to retail investors, most bonds are traded on an over-the-counter market. Unlike stock trading - for which automation has leveled the playing field for retail and institutional investors - the bond market lacks liquidity and price transparency except for the most liquid of bonds. For the self-directed bond investor, for whom it may make little sense to invest in expensive actively managed bond funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track bond indices may offer a good alternative. While similar to other ETFs, bond ETFs are unique in the world of fixed income because, as they are traded on stock exchanges, the current and historical prices of bond ETFs are available to all investors. Historically, this kind of price transparency for bonds has been available only to institutional investors. The challenge for the architect of a bond ETF is to ensure that it closely tracks its respective index in a cost-effective manner, despite the lack of liquidity in the bond market. Most bonds are held until\u00a0maturity, so the secondary market may not be very active and lack an availability of buyers and sellers. This makes it difficult to ensure a bond ETF encompasses enough liquid bonds to track an index. This challenge is bigger for corporate bonds than for government bonds. The suppliers of bond ETFs get around the liquidity problem by using representative sampling, which simply means tracking only a sufficient number of bonds to represent an index. The bonds used in the representative sample tend to be the largest and most liquid in the index. Given the liquidity of government bonds, tracking errors will be less of a problem with ETFs that represent government bond indices. Bond ETFs pay out interest through a monthly dividend, while any capital gains are paid out through an annual dividend. For tax purposes, these dividends are treated as either income or capital gains. However, the tax efficiency of bond ETFs is not a big factor, because capital gains do not play as big of a part in bond returns as they do in stock returns. Finally, bond ETFs are available on a global basis. Very generally speaking, you'll come across three types of bonds within a bond ETF. The composition of these three types of bonds (or inclusion of other types of fixed-income securities) will depend on the specific bond ETF. One significant category within bond ETFs comprises government bonds. These bonds are issued by national governments and are considered among the safest fixed-income instruments (as it's assumed the issuing government entity is not near defaulting). Governments issue bonds to raise funds for public consumption or special initiatives. Another crucial component of bond ETFs is corporate bonds. These are debt securities issued by corporations to raise capital. Corporate bond ETFs can widely range in creditworthiness, with companies with stronger credit and outlook being more secure and companies with going concerns being much more risky. Similar to federal government bonds, municipal bond ETFs provide exposure to the debt issued by government entities to fund public projects. Investors are drawn to municipal bonds for potential tax advantages, as the interest income may be exempt from federal and, in some cases, state taxes. Again, in many contexts, municipal bonds are considered safer than corporate bonds. The liquidity and transparency of an ETF offers advantages over a passively held bond ladder. Bond ETFs offer instant diversification and a constant duration, which means an investor needs to make only one trade to get a fixed-income portfolio up and running. A bond ladder, which requires buying individual bonds, does not offer this luxury. One disadvantage of bond ETFs is that they charge an ongoing management fee. While lower\u00a0spreads on trading bond ETFs help offset this somewhat, the issue will still prevail with a buy-and-hold strategy over the longer term.\u00a0The initial trading spread advantage of bond ETFs is eroded over time by the annual management fee. The second disadvantage is that there is no flexibility to create something unique for a portfolio. The ETF's portfolio manager decides the mix of bonds to hold, or else is beholden to an established index of bonds that already exists. Bond ETFs and index bond funds cover similar indices, use similar optimization strategies and have similar performance. Bond ETFs, however, are the better alternative for those looking for more flexible trading and better transparency. The make-up of the underlying portfolio for a bond ETF is available daily online, but this type of information for index bond funds is available only on a semi-annual basis. Furthermore, on top of being able to trade bond ETFs throughout the day, active traders can enjoy the ability to use margin, sell short, and trade options on these securities. The main disadvantage of bond ETFs is the trading commissions they generate. Therefore, they make more sense for larger and less frequent trades. However, ETFs don't pose this disadvantage for investors who purchase their index bond funds through a third party (such as an online broker), which also charges a fee for the fund trade. There are becoming more and more viable alternative ETFs. In January 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved several Bitcoin ETFs, expanding the ETF arena to include cryptocurrency. Both bond ETFs and bond mutual funds provide investors fixed-income exposure. However, they are mechanically different. Bond ETFs trade on stock exchanges throughout the day at market prices. This intraday trading highlights ETF flexibility. On the other hand, bond mutual funds are bought or sold at the end of the trading day at the net asset value (NAV). This key distinction means that investors in bond mutual funds may not have the same intraday trading opportunities as those in bond ETFs. The management styles of bond ETFs and bond mutual funds also vary. Bond ETFs are often passively managed, aiming to replicate the performance of a specific bond index. In contrast, bond mutual funds may be actively managed, with portfolio managers making decisions to outperform the market. Though this usually means higher fees, it also means potentially higher returns (before the fees). Bond ETFs and stock ETFs are distinct investment vehicles with somewhat different goals. Bond ETFs are considered lower-risk investments, offering more predictable returns through interest payments. They are particularly attractive to investors seeking income and capital preservation, making them great for retirees or those wanting to be more conservative. On the other hand, stock ETFs generally involve higher risk and the potential for higher returns. Both types of investments may have an income component. Investors in stock ETFs may benefit from dividend income paid by the underlying companies. Note that companies are not obligated to continue to pay dividends like they have in their past, unlike the fixed coupon rate for a bond for the entirety of its life. Bond ETFs face credit risk associated with the issuers of the underlying bonds, whereas stock ETFs are not directly exposed to credit risk but are influenced by business and market-related risks. In other words, bond ETFs are at risk if the borrower defaults as this means they may not pay the entire amount of the bond back. While there is no debt to an equity ETF, the underlying companies can still incur losses and lose value. Investors often use a combination of both bond and stock ETFs to achieve a diversified portfolio. You can do this if you want to balances risk and return. Bond ETFs are favored by those seeking stability and income, while stock ETFs are chosen by those aiming for growth and willing to accept higher market volatility. Yes, bond ETFs are traded on stock exchanges such as NYSE or NASDAQ. This trading feature allows investors to buy and sell these funds throughout the trading day, providing flexibility and liquidity compared to traditional bonds traded over-the-counter. The challenge for the architect of a bond ETF is to ensure that it closely tracks its respective index. This can be tough for certain bonds like corporate bonds. The secondary market for bonds may not be very active, leading to challenges in making sure there's enough liquid bonds in the ETF to accurate track to an index. Bond ETFs usually pay out interest through a monthly dividend. In most cases, any capital gains are distributed through an annual dividend. For tax purposes, these dividends are treated either as income (taxed at the individual's income rate) or capital gains (taxed at a different rate based on the term held). Bond ETFs have ongoing management fees, eroding the initial trading spread advantage over time with a buy-and-hold strategy. Additionally, there is limited flexibility in creating a unique portfolio, as the ETF's portfolio manager determines the mix of bonds or follows an established index. Because of this, the goal of the ETF is not necessarily to make as much money as it can but instead to closely mirror an index. Bond ETFs\u00a0offer\u00a0an excellent alternative for self-directed investors who, looking for ease of trading and increased price transparency, want to practice indexing or active bond trading. However, bond ETFs are suitable for particular strategies. If, for instance, you are looking to create a specific income stream, bond ETFs may not be for you. Be sure to compare your alternatives before investing.

Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning. ilkercelik / Getty Images The Series EE Bond (often referred to as a \"Patriot Bond\") is a non-marketable, interest-bearing U.S. government savings bond. These bonds are guaranteed to at least double in value over the typical 20-year initial term. Some Series EE bonds have total interest-paying lives that extend beyond the original maturity date, up to 30 years from issuance. Coupon rates for Series EE Bonds are determined at the time of issuance and are based on the percentage of the long-term Treasury rates. Along with the Series I bond, the Series EE bond is one of the two types of savings bonds issued by the US Treasury. Series EE bonds cannot be bought or sold in the open market, and are hence classified as non-marketable securities. Series EE bonds issued after May 2005 are assigned semi-annual fixed coupon rates on May 1 and November 1. The rates apply to all issuances for the ensuing six months. Bonds issued after each date increase in value monthly, but interest payments are handed out semiannually. Series EE bonds are considered ultra-safe, low-risk investments, whose interest is typically exempt from state and local taxes. However, they are subject to federal taxes, but only in the year in which the bond matures or is redeemed. EE Bonds may be purchased by U.S. citizens, official U.S. residents, minors, and all U.S. government employees\u2014regardless of their citizenship status. Paper EE bonds were re-issued as \"Patriot Bonds\" after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. They are identical in every way to the paper Series EE Bonds except that any paper bonds purchased through a financial institution after Dec. 10, 2001, have the words \"Patriot Bond\" printed on the top half of the bond certificate, situated between the Social Security Number (SSN) and the issue date. Financial institutions no longer issue Series EE bonds in paper form, but the paper Patriot Bonds can still be cashed or converted into electronic bonds. Series EE bonds don't need to be reissued to correct small typographical errors in names, addresses, or Social Security numbers. There is a $25 minimum investment requirement for EE bonds, and each investor may purchase up to $10,000 in these bonds each calendar year. Furthermore, bondholders must hold onto these investments for at least twelve months, before they can redeem the bonds. Those who redeem bonds within five years will be docked three months of accrued interest payments. Since EE bonds earn interest for up to 30 years, the longer they're held, the more they're worth. Paper bonds\u00a0were issued at a 50% discount to par, while bonds electronically sourced through TreasuryDirect are purchased at face value. The latter is still guaranteed to be worth twice their original value at first maturity date after 20 years while paying interest the same way as paper EE bonds."

These programs are also known as credit monitoring services. You receive notices about any changes, allowing you to act on suspicious activities before they can harm your credit score or credit history. These services are also sometimes used to combat identity theft. A credit watch service tracks changes in borrower behavior so that consumers are aware of potential fraud and changes to their creditworthiness. While these are increasingly available for free, several of them still are fee-based services. Most credit watch paid services will notify you within a business day when a credit application appears on your credit report. The intent of this service is to provide alerts for changes to your credit report. These updates provide you with a timely opportunity to contact any agencies involved and take action to prevent damages. A credit watch service can be valuable for your financial well-being and toolbox. Along with the advantages these services have, there are some disadvantages you should be aware of. While credit watch services can provide identity theft\u00a0or fraud warnings, for the most part, they offer protection only after the fact. These services work best as part of a broader strategy to protect and monitor personal information that bad actors could use to commit fraud. In particular, you should remain vigilant about the circumstances under which you disseminate important personal information, including your Social Security number, bank account number, and credit card numbers. In many cases, simple awareness of\u00a0social engineering\u00a0techniques criminals use to obtain such information can provide substantial protection against identity theft. Checking the accuracy of credit card statements and reliable credit monitoring services offer a useful second line of defense. Let's say that Robert is worried about his identity because his information was included in a recent data breach at a business he frequents. He signed up for Ernie's Credit Watch service, which will monitor his credit reports from the three main credit bureaus\u2014TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax\u2014for changes such as credit applications. A few weeks later, Ernie's notices Robert has had a slew of credit applications for new credit cards, some of which are in different countries. Ernie's alerts Robert that these applications have been made. Robert views his credit report and can dispute the applications and take additional measures against identity theft since his personal information has been stolen and used to open fraudulent accounts. Equifax credit watch services provide alerts about changes on your credit file and give you access to your credit report so that you can act if there are any suspicious changes. You can monitor your credit and identity or your entire family's, up to four children. CreditSecure by American Express monitors your credit reports, personal data, and personally identifiable information. Whether the service is worth it depends on your circumstances and if you believe you'll benefit from it. A credit watch is a service for monitoring your credit report and personal information to provide alerts for suspicious activity. Credit watch service providers give you additional notifications about your credit and identity. These services do not protect you from identity theft or keep your credit from being accessed\u2014they alert you when someone uses your identity or credit. You may not need the help of a credit watch service if you're diligent and keep yourself informed, but if you believe it's more convenient to have an automatic service monitor and notify you, you could benefit by subscribing to a credit watch service.

Analysts on the sell-side will write opinions to educate others on their research and in an attempt to sell particular stocks on behalf of clients. For a stock, an analyst may assign a \"buy\", \"hold \" or \"sell\" rating and an explanation of why they recommend this action for the stock. When it comes to major Wall Street banks and institutions, they all use different terminology and classifications. Morgan Stanley, for example, uses the terms \"overweight\", \"equal-weight\", and \"underweight\". The timeline for its ratings is 12 to 18 months. Credit Suisse uses the terms \"outperform,\" \"neutral\", and \"underperform\", which is based on a 12-month time period. All of these terms are variations of the \"buy\", \"hold\", and \"sell\" ratings. In August 2023, Fitch Ratings dropped the credit rating of the United States from AAA to AA+, citing a \"steady deterioration in standards of governance\" within Congress over raising the country's debt ceiling. These bouts of brinkmanship raised the prospects that the U.S. might eventually default on some debts, increasing the risk for international lenders. The other two major agencies did not change their evaluation of the country's credit risk. For a bond, a rating agency will assess the bond's relative safety based upon the issuing entity's fundamental financial picture, which scrutinizes the issuer's ability to repay the principal and make interest payments. The ratings for Moody's and S&P from highest to lowest in the investment grade category are Aaa/AAA, Aa1/AA+, Aa2/AA, Aa3/AA-, A1/A+, A2/A, A3/A-, Baa1/BBB+, Baa2/BBB and Baa3/BBB-. Standard & Poor's is the provider of the S&P 500 Index, as well as a leading data source and index provider of independent credit ratings. S&P 500 Index is a widely utilized gauge for determining the overall condition of the U.S. stock market. Moody's is a provider of international financial research on government and commercial issued bonds. Moody's utilizes a rating system to judge a borrower's creditworthiness. This rating scale goes starts at Aaa (being of the highest quality) and goes to C (being of the lowest quality). Fitch Ratings is also a credit rating agency that is international. This agency bases its ratings on factors such as how sensitive a company is to internal changes and the kind of debt the company holds.\u00a0Fitch is used by investors as a guide to what investments will not default and will, in turn, lead to a solid return. The ratings assigned by the various rating agencies are based primarily upon the insurer's or issuer's creditworthiness. This rating can, therefore, be interpreted as a direct measure of the probability of default. However, credit stability and priority of payment are also factored into the rating. When it comes to credit ratings, a bond is considered \"Investment grade\" if it has a rating of BBB- or higher from Standard and Poors, or a rating of Baa3 or higher from Moody's. These ratings indicate that the borrower has a relatively high chance of repaying their debts on time, with low risk for the lender. A bond is considered \"speculative\" if it has a rating of BBB- or lower from Standard and Poor's, or a rating of Baa3 or lower from Moody's. These ratings indicate a relatively high degree of credit risk, and borrowers must pay higher interest rates to accomodate the higher risk. A lower credit rating means that credit agencies believe the borrower is becoming more risky, either due to a higher level of debt, falling income, or other causes that make the borrower less able to pay their obligations. These borrowers will need to pay higher interest rates to make up for the increased risk to lenders. Ratings are used to assess the quality of an investment, such as a stock or bond. Analysts issue ratings for different instruments based on the risks and opportunities associated with a particular investment. There are several different ratings agencies with their own systems for evaluating risk and opportunity.

            "title": "Preferred Stock ETFs vs. Bond ETFs: What's the Difference?",
            "content": "Both offer portfolio diversification, liquidity, and low expenses Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Investors in preferred stocks and in corporate bonds have similar motivations. They're looking for a long-term investment with a reasonable and regular return on their money. Today's investors can choose exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on preferred stocks or corporate bonds. Whether you choose one or the other should\u00a0be based\u00a0on the current economic environment as well as\u00a0your investment strategy. From the investor's viewpoint, preferred stocks are a blend of a bond and a stock. Their prices aren't volatile like common stock shares. The point is the dividends these shares pay. They also are considered safer than common stocks. Even in the event of bankruptcy, preferred shareholders are closer to the front of the line for repayment than common shareholders. Preferred stock ETFs give the investor exposure to a range of preferred stocks, thus diversifying your portfolio. Let\u2019s start with a quick look at two of the most popular preferred stock ETFs. Tracks the ICE BofAML Core Plus Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index. Financials as of Dec. 15, 2023. Tracks the S&P U.S. Preferred Stock Index. Financials as of Dec. 15, 2023. The appreciation and high yield for the two preferred stock ETFs above might be tempting, but when interest rates increase they\u2019re not likely to perform as well. Both also performed poorly during the financial crisis, demonstrating a lack of resiliency. A bond is a loan to a corporation in return for a regular payment of interest. As with preferred stocks, the point of bonds, to the investor, is the regular income they generate. All bonds are rated by one of several rating agencies for the creditworthiness of the companies that issue them. The highest-rated bonds may pay the least but are the safest. Low-rated bonds are riskier but pay better. So-called \"junk bonds\" are at high risk of default by their issuers. Tracks the Bloomberg High Yield Very Liquid Index. Financials as of Dec. 15, 2023. Tracks the Bloomberg Long U.S. Treasury Index. Financials as of Dec. 15, 2023. Still, these two choices illustrate the many situations in which yield or lack of it can be deceiving. Most investors chase high yield, not realizing that they\u2019re often putting themselves more at risk for depreciation. A high yield doesn\u2019t mean anything if\u00a0an ETF\u2019s shares slide. That\u2019s the beauty of TLT. The yield might not be extraordinary (still relatively generous), and it tends to appreciate during difficult times because big money rushes to safety. Note that JNK is not a symbol selected for a fund that invests in the highest-quality AAA-rated bonds. Preferred stock ETFs are more appealing in low-interest rate times thanks to their high yields, but they\u2019re not likely to appreciate as much as ETFs tracking common shares during bull markets. Bond ETFs have a reputation for offering greater safety, but it depends on the bond ETF. For instance, JNK offers a high yield, but it\u2019s not a place be during poor economic periods when defaults are more likely. TLT might not offer as much yield, but it offers resiliency and the low expense ratio is a bonus.

            "content": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). A stable value fund is a portfolio of bonds that are insured to protect the investor against a decline in yield or a loss of capital. The owner of a stable value fund will continue to receive the agreed-upon interest payments regardless of the state of the economy. Stable value funds are a common option in some retirement plans such as company 401(k) plans, especially aimed at those savers nearing retirement. Stable value funds invest in high-quality government and corporate bonds, short-term, and intermediate-term. They are no different from any bond fund, except they are insured. An insurance company or bank is contractually obligated to protect the fund's investors from any loss of capital or interest. The bonds in such a fund are sometimes called \"wrapped\" bonds, referring to the fact that they are insured. The insurance is commonly issued in the form of a so-called synthetic\u00a0guaranteed investment certificate (GIC). A stable value fund is inherently as safe an investment as a money market fund. Historically, such funds provide a slightly higher rate of return than money market funds. Stable value funds remain just that: stable. They don't grow over time, but they don't lose value either. In times of recession or stock market volatility, stable value funds are guaranteed. While many other investments drop in value, the owner of a stable bond fund continues to receive the agreed-upon interest payments and never loses principal regardless of the state of the economy. The insurer must compensate the fund for any losses. Because of the insurance, however, these funds come with extra management costs and fees, which can be a drag on the already lower yields that these investments offer due to their low risk. A stable value fund is often an investment option in qualified retirement plans such as 401(k) plans. A stable value fund may also be an appealing alternative to lower-yielding vehicles such as money market funds for the portion of an investor's portfolio that is used to counter market volatility. Stable value funds can provide the essential elements of balance and stability in a portfolio weighted in growth investments. However, there is a danger if a portfolio is weighted too heavily in lower-yielding investments such as stable value funds. The investor risks being squeezed by inflation down the road. A retirement income that seems sufficient initially can gradually become inadequate as the years pass and inflation mounts. Most professional financial advisors recommend a portfolio that is a mix of safe but low-yielding investments and risky but potentially rewarding investments, with a gradual reweighting towards safety as the investor approaches retirement age. Investors also should check the expenses associated with stable value funds. Historically, their fees have been in the low range compared to most mutual funds. However, insurance companies have been increasing their fees due to the perceived risks of a more volatile market."

            "title": "U.S. Savings Bonds vs. CDs: What\u2019s the Difference?",
            "content": "The biggest one is your time line Skylar Clarine is a fact-checker and expert in personal finance with a range of experience including veterinary technology and film studies. CocoSan / Getty Images U.S. savings bonds and certificates of deposit (CDs) are both savings vehicles that offer a modest profit for a high degree of safety. In both cases, the investor is lending some cash in return for the payment of a set amount of interest. Both are easy, convenient ways to invest without going through a broker. Your savings will be safe and earn interest. There are differences, though, and the biggest comes down to time. U.S. savings bonds are designed to be a long-term investment, while CDs can be found with maturities as short as one month. Investopedia / Hilary Allison A U.S. savings bond is guaranteed to double in value over 20 years, and it can keep earning interest if held for up to 30 years. That\u2019s why the savings bond is a traditional gift for newborn babies. A savings bond cannot be cashed in during the first year, and a penalty of three months\u2019 interest is imposed for cashing it in before five years have passed. After that, the owner of the bond will get back the purchase price in full and forgo future interest payments. There are two main varieties of U.S. government savings bonds: Certificates of deposit (CDs) are issued by banks and are a form of savings account. They pay a little more interest than a regular savings account. A CD can be bought for a term as short as one month and as long as 10 years. The shorter the term, the lower the interest rate. The interest rates offered at any given time are tied to the current prime rate. Thus, if you\u2019re CD shopping at a time of low rates and rock-bottom inflation, it makes sense to avoid tying up your money for a long period. If it looks like interest rates will rise soon, you can buy a one-, three-, or six-month CD and shop around for a better deal when it matures. Some investors use a strategy called laddering to invest in CDs. They buy a new CD every month or every three months regardless of the interest rates offered. That gives them exposure to the highest rates available at any given time while ensuring that some cash is readily available as an older CD matures. Of the two investment options, CDs are the more flexible. You don\u2019t have to commit to a long-term investment or tie up your money for an extended period. However, should you need to redeem the CD early, you will be assessed a penalty. It\u2019s also not a good idea to keep your emergency fund in a CD because early withdrawal penalties can eat up several months of interest and even a small amount of principal. It pays to shop around for a CD, as each bank sets its rates based on the current prime rate. You can store your emergency fund in a bond or a certificate of deposit (CD). However, should you need to withdraw your money immediately if a financial emergency arises, you will incur a penalty fee if the CD or bond has not reached maturity. So, it can be more prudent to keep emergency funds in a more liquid account like a high-yield money market savings account. Both CDs and U.S. savings bonds have various maturities and interest rates and offer the lowest investment risk for investors. CDs feature Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) protection up to $250,000 per account. U.S. savings bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States and do not limit the coverage amount. To buy an EE savings bond, you\u2019ll have to do so online at TreasuryDirect. Once you make an account, you\u2019ll be able to purchase the bond. You can also buy paper Series I bonds using your federal tax return. Both savings bonds and CDs are considered extremely safe investments. U.S. savings bonds have a AAA rating and are \u201cbacked by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\u201d CDs up to $250,000 are fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC). Income earned from CDs is taxable at both the state and federal level. Also, these earnings are taxed as interest income rather than as capital gains, which carries a lower rate. You should receive a 1099-INT form from the financial institution that holds the CD. When your earnings span several tax years, you will pay tax only on the portion that was earned in that taxing year. Should you hold the CD in a tax-advantaged retirement account, such as a 401(k) or an individual retirement account (IRA), these taxes can be deferred. Any interest earned from a saving bond is taxable. You will need to report this interest income on your annual federal tax filing. However, there are no state and local taxes assessed. Also, Series EE and Series I bonds may qualify for education tax exclusion if you use them to pay for qualified higher education expenses and you are a qualified taxpayer. These funds may help you offset the cost of tuition and other fees.

            "title": "Buying Stocks Instead of Bonds: Pros and Cons",
            "content": "Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Stocks and bonds each possess their own sets of advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, each asset class features dramatically different structures, payouts, returns, and risks. Understanding the distinguishing factors that separate these two asset classes is key to building a healthy investment portfolio that thrives over the long haul. Of course, asset allocation mixes are unique to each individual, based on an investor's age, risk tolerance, and long-term investment and retirement goals. Stocks are essentially ownership stakes in publicly-traded corporations that give investors an opportunity to participate in a company's growth. But these investments also carry the potential of declining in value, where they may even drop to zero. In either scenario, the profitability of the investment depends almost entirely on fluctuations in stock prices, which are fundamentally tied to the growth and profitability of the company. A bond is a fixed income instrument that represents a loan made by investors (known as \"creditors\" or \"debtholders\") to borrowers, which are typically corporations or governmental entities. Also known as coupons, bonds are characterized by the fact that the ultimate payouts are guaranteed by the borrower. With these investments, there is a concrete maturity date, upon which the principal is repaid to investors, along with interest payments attached to the interest rate that existed at the onset of the loan. Bonds are used by corporations, states, municipalities, and sovereign governments to finance a multitude of projects and operations. That said, some bonds do carry the risk of default, where it is indeed possible for an investor to lose their money. Such bonds are rated below investment grade, and are referred to as high-yield bonds, non-investment-grade bonds, speculative-grade bonds, or junk bonds. Nevertheless, they attract a subset of fixed income investors that enjoy the prospect of higher yields. The chief advantage stocks have over bonds, is their ability to generate higher returns. Consequently, investors who are willing to take on greater risks in exchange for the potential to benefit from rising stock prices would be better off choosing stocks. Investors may also wish to consider investing in dividend-paying stocks. A dividend is essentially a distribution of some of the profits that a corporation makes to its shareholders. And any dividends that are not taken may be re-invested in the business\u00a0in the form of more shares in a company. Bonds also pay regular income in the form of interest payments; however, these cannot be reinvested back into the same bond. Interest rates can change over the life of the bond, which creates reinvestment risk, or the risk that new bonds will have lower yields than the ones you are receiving interest from. Diversifying investments across both stocks and bonds, marries the relative safety of the bonds, with the higher return potential of stocks. In general, stocks are riskier than bonds, simply due to the fact that they offer no guaranteed returns to the investor, unlike bonds, which offer fairly reliable returns through coupon payments. Stocks are inherently more volatile than bonds because in the event of a corporate bankruptcy, bondholders (who are a company's creditors) have priority in being repaid. Meanwhile, owners of common stock are last in line, and can end up with nothing if the company goes bankrupt. Risk-averse investors looking to safely deploy their capital and take comfort in more structured payout schedules would be better off investing in bonds. The historical returns for stocks have been between 8%-10% since 1928. The historical returns for bonds have been lower, between 4%-6% since 1928. Over the past 30 years, stocks have returned an average of 11% annually; while bonds have returned just 5.6% per year, on average. A well-diversified portfolio contains a broad range of holdings across several asset classes. In general, the longer your time horizon (i.e., the younger you are), the more risk you can take on. Therefore a portfolio weighted 80-90% in stocks and the rest in bonds or other assets is bearable. However, as your time horizon shortens, it is recommended to shift your allocation increasingly toward lower-risk bonds and reduce your allocation to stocks. Stocks generally outperform bonds over time due to the equity risk premium that investors enjoy over bonds. This is an amount that investors of stocks demand in return for taking on the additional risk associated with stocks. Stocks also benefit from a growing economy. As GDP grows, so too do corporate profits, which are reflected in the prices of stocks, but not typically in bonds (which are essentially loans).

            "title": "Why Are Most Bonds Traded on the Secondary Market \"Over the Counter\"?",
            "content": "Like stocks, after issuance in the primary market, bonds are traded between investors in the secondary market. However, unlike stocks, most bonds are not traded in the secondary market via exchanges. Rather, bonds are traded over-the-counter (OTC). There are several reasons why most bonds are traded OTC, but chief among them is their diversity. Before looking at the bond market, let's consider how stocks commonly trade. Stocks have two primary types, common stock and preferred stock, and are limited to just a few characteristics. Bonds, on the other hand, each have different qualities, maturities, and yields. The outcome of this diversity is more issuers, and issues of bonds with different characteristics, which makes it difficult for bonds to be traded on exchanges. Another reason why bonds are traded over the counter is the difficulty in listing current prices. Stock prices are affected by news events, the P/E ratio of a company and, ultimately, the supply and demand of shares, which are reflected in the daily stock price. In contrast, bond prices are affected by changing interest rates and credit ratings. Since trade time between issues can last weeks or even months, it is difficult to list current prices for a particular bond issue, which would make it challenging to trade bonds on the stock market. Most\u00a0corporate bonds\u00a0issued by private and public corporations are traded OTC rather than listed on exchanges. Furthermore, many of the transactions involving exchange-traded bonds are done through OTC markets. Corporate bonds are issued by firms to raise capital to fund various expenditures. They are attractive to investors because they provide much higher yields than bonds issued by the government. However, this higher yield is accompanied by higher risk. Investment in corporate bonds comes primarily from pension funds, mutual funds, banks, insurance companies, and individual investors. The bonds that are traded on the OTC markets vary in the degree of liquidity that they enjoy. Liquidity gives investors ample opportunity to buy and sell bonds before maturity at fair prices. Along with this liquidity, corporate bonds traded OTC provide investors with a steady stream of income and security because they are rated based on the credit history of the issuing firm. However, these bonds are not perfect investments, and they include major risks, such as credit risk and call risk. Credit risk can arise when an issuer is unable to maintain payments on the bond or if a rating corporation lowers the credit rating of the issuer. Call risk occurs when an issuer redeems the issue before maturity, leaving the investor with less favorable investing possibilities. Many analysts and pundits claim that over-the-counter (OTC) transactions and financial instruments, especially derivatives, increase systematic risk. In particular, concerns about counterparty risk grew following the financial crisis of 2007-2009, when credit-default swaps in the derivatives market received much of the blame for massive losses in the financial sector. Transactions in financial markets are either organized in exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, or occur over-the-counter. An OTC trade is executed directly between two parties and is not overseen or subject to the rules of major exchanges. These off-exchange trades incorporate all of the types of assets seen in exchanges, including commodities, equities, and debt instruments. Derivatives can be made of any asset and only represent contracts based on the value of underlying financial assets. Futures contracts, forward contracts, options, and swaps are all derivatives. Derivatives trading makes up a large part of global markets and is increasingly prevalent due to improvements in computing technology. The controversy about OTC transactions centers on a lack of oversight and information. Major exchanges have a large incentive to control and regulate trades that occur on their watch. OTC traders watch out for themselves to a greater degree. That said, the risk of financial loss is very real on exchanges as well, and there is no guarantee exchange trading is less risky than OTC trading. Overall, OTC transactions do not have the same rules about contract enforcement as most exchanges. The risk of a party failing to live up to its contractual obligations is often called counterparty risk, although it may sometimes be referred to as default risk. While counterparty risk exists in any contract, it is perceived as a larger threat when the contracts are made over the counter.

Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. A bond fund is a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that buys and sells debt instruments like government and corporate bonds. The primary goal of a bond fund is to generate monthly income for investors. For an investor, a bond fund is an alternative to buying individual bonds. The investor in a bond fund is buying shares in a fund that buys and sells many bonds. Typically, a bond fund manager buys and sells according to market conditions and rarely holds bonds until maturity. For many investors, a bond fund is a more efficient way of investing than buying individual bond securities. Unlike individual bond securities, bond funds do not have a maturity date for the repayment of principal, so the principal amount invested may fluctuate from time to time. Investors in bond funds receive monthly payments that reflect the mix of all the bonds in the fund, which means that the interest income payment will vary monthly. Bonds are rated according to the degree of risk that their issuers will default on their debts. An \"AAA\" or \"AA\" bond is issued by a company or government that is highly unlikely to default. An \"F\" bond is on the edge. Most bond funds are comprised of a certain type of bond, such as corporate or government bonds. They also focus on a time to maturity, such as short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term. Investors can choose bond funds that buy only the highest-quality and safest bonds, such as U.S. government bonds or the bonds of blue-chip companies. High-quality bonds pay lower interest than riskier bonds. Investors should note that U.S. government bonds are considered to be of the highest credit quality. Bond funds that specialize in U.S. Treasury securities, including Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), are the safest but offer the lowest potential return. Other funds invest in only riskier bonds\u2014high-yield or junk bonds. Bond funds that invest in riskier bonds offer higher returns along with a higher risk of default by the bond issuer. There are also bond funds that have a mix of the different types of bonds to create multi-asset class options. The types of bond funds available include US government bond funds; municipal bond funds; corporate bond funds; mortgage-backed securities (MBS) funds; high-yield bond funds; emerging market bond funds, and global bond funds. Mutual funds have been investing in bonds for many years. Some of the oldest\u00a0balanced funds, which include allocations to both stock and bonds, date back to the late 1920s. Bond funds are an attractive option compared to buying individual bonds. They provide greater portfolio diversification than an individual investor could manage independently. By investing in a bond fund, an investor need only pay the annual expense ratio that covers marketing, administrative, and professional management fees. The alternative is to purchase multiple bonds separately and deal with the transaction costs associated with each. Since a fund usually invests in many bonds of varying maturities, the impact of any single bond\u2019s performance is lessened. Another benefit of a bond mutual fund is that it provides access to professional portfolio managers who have the expertise to research and analyze the creditworthiness of bond issuers and market conditions before buying into or selling out of the fund. For example, a fund manager may replace bonds when the issuer's credit is downgraded or when the issuer \"calls,\" or pays off the bond, before its maturity date. Bond funds can be sold at any time for their current market net asset value (NAV), which may result in a capital gain or loss. Individual bonds can be harder to unload. From a tax perspective, some investors in higher tax brackets may find that they have a higher after-tax yield from a tax-free municipal bond fund investment rather than a taxable bond fund investment. Due to the inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices, a long-term bond carries greater interest rate risk than a short-term bond. Therefore, the NAV of bond funds with longer-term maturities will be impacted greatly by changes in interest rates. This, in turn, will affect how much interest income the fund can distribute to its participants monthly. Bond ETFs have been around for less time than bond mutual funds, with\u00a0iShares\u00a0launching the first bond ETF fund in 2002. Most of these offerings seek to replicate various bond indices, although a growing number of actively managed products are also available. ETFs often have lower fees than their mutual fund counterparts. Like stocks, ETFs trade throughout the day. The prices for shares can fluctuate moment by moment and may vary quite a bit over the course of a day's trading. Bond ETFs operate much like closed-end funds, in that they are purchased through a brokerage account rather than directly from a fund company. When the investor wishes to sell, ETFs must be traded on the open market. The fund company will not purchase the shares, as is done for open-ended mutual funds. There is a wide variety of bond ETFs and bond mutual funds to choose from. They include funds that invest in California municipal bonds, U.S. or international government bonds, investment-grade corporate bonds, and tax-exempt bonds. Funds may invest in short-term, medium-term, or long-term bonds. The three largest bond ETFs at this writing are the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG), the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), and the Vanguard Total International Bond ETF (BNDX). As of the end of the first quarter of 2024, the best-performing bond mutual funds among the top 10 largest funds, and their one-year performance, were:  Bond ETFs and bond mutual funds are an alternative to individual bond-picking for the investor interested in a steady stream of income. Like bonds, bond funds are generally a choice for the conservative investor. As with any investment, a little more risk has the potential for a relatively larger return.

            "content": "Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street. Investors seeking capital preservation often focus portfolio allocations on minimal-risk investment options, including cash, money markets, certificates of deposit, and bonds. Under the bond category, short-term bonds fall on the safer end of the debt securities risk spectrum due to their short duration and subsequent near-cash status. A shorter duration or maturity date leads to less credit risk and less interest rate risk. For conservative investors, short-term bonds are attractive because they effectively reduce volatility. Mutual funds in the short-duration bond category provide this diversification by investing in high-quality bond holdings across various types of issuers, industries, and regions. The fund offers diversification in terms of regional exposure, credit quality, and bond issuer type. Established in 1982, the Vanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade Fund seeks to provide investors with current income and focuses on maintaining minimal price volatility. Fund managers invest a substantial amount of the fund's assets in high-quality fixed-income securities, with no less than 80% in short and intermediate-term debt issues. The mutual fund invested 17.9% of its assets in commercial mortgage or asset-backed securities and 3.9% in Treasury or agency bonds on June 30, 2020.\ufeff\ufeff The fund currently manages $66.8 billion in investor assets across over 2,427 holdings. As of October 2020, it has generated a 10-year average annualized total return of 2.55%.\ufeff\ufeff The fund has an expense ratio of 0.2%, well below the category average of 0.74%. Investors can buy shares without an upfront sales load, and no charge is assessed when shares are redeemed. The fund's 30-day Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yield was 0.97% on Oct. 6, 2020. It requires a minimum initial investment of $3,000. Admiral shares are available with an investment of $50,000 or more, and their expense ratio is only 0.1%.\ufeff\ufeff The DFA Short-Term Extended Quality Portfolio was established in March 2009 and seeks to provide investors with the maximum total return within the realm of debt securities.\ufeff\ufeff Fund managers invest a minimum of 80% of the portfolio in fixed-income securities believed to be investment-grade quality. Up to 25% of the fund's assets may be invested in bonds, bills, and notes issued by the U.S. Treasury, government agencies, or federal instrumentalities.\ufeff\ufeff The average maturity of the bonds underlying the fund was 1.44 years on Oct. 6, 2020. The average effective duration was 1.37 years. The fund shifted to shorter maturities in 2019, likely in response to declining interest rates. Lower maturities usually lead to lower yields, and the 30-day SEC yield is down to .33%. The mutual fund managed $6.2 billion in investor assets. It generated a ten-year average annualized return of 2.06% as of October 2020. The mutual fund has an expense ratio of 0.22%, which falls below the category average, and investors can purchase shares with no upfront or deferred sales charge. The iShares Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF began in January of 2007, which gives it a substantial price and performance history for an ETF.\ufeff\ufeff The fund's objective is to track an index of short-term U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds. The fund does not include government bonds, so it has a higher yield and slightly higher volatility. The fund had $20.3 billion in assets and an average daily volume of 2.14 million shares traded as of Oct. 6, 2020. The size of the market for the fund ensures small spreads, which is a significant factor for bond ETFs. Over the ten years ending with October 2020, the average total return was 3.04% per year. The 30-day SEC yield was 0.92% on Oct. 6. Fees are low, at just 0.06%. This fund has no sales loads or minimum investment requirements. The Fidelity Short-Term Bond Fund has an inception date of March 1986, and the fund seeks to obtain a high level of current income for investors.\ufeff\ufeff With the preservation of capital in mind, fund managers invest at least 80% of the portfolio in investment-grade debt securities or repurchase agreements. The investment mix includes domestic and foreign issuers, with 53.17% invested in corporate issuers, 18.60% in U.S. Treasury bonds, and 15.07% in asset-backed securities (ABS). The fund has accumulated $3.2 billion in assets as of Oct. 6, 2020. The mutual fund generated an average annual total return of 1.75% over the last ten years. Coincidentally, the fund also had a 30-day yield of 0.52% on Oct. 6, 2020. The mutual fund has an expense ratio of 0.45%, in line with the majority of short-term bond mutual funds. The fund does not charge an upfront or deferred sales load, and there is no minimum investment requirement. The Schwab Short-Term Bond Index Fund seeks to provide investors with high current income. This mutual fund tracks the performance of the Bloomberg U.S. Government/Credit: 1-5 Years Index by investing a substantial amount of the portfolio assets in debt instruments found on the benchmark. Fund managers focus on investment-grade debt instruments in the fixed, variable, and floating interest rate categories with various maturities. The fund is a rather new addition with an inception date of February 23, 2017. However, the underlying securities and strategy employed on this fund make it a solid choice for the fixed-income component of any portfolio. SWSBX has accumulated $1.8 billion in assets as of Oct. 2, 2020. The expense ratio of 0.06% is impressively low, as one would expect from an index fund. The 30-day yield was just 0.31%, mostly because 67% of the fund is invested in lower-yielding government and agency bonds. Investors are not charged a sales load at the time of purchase or redemption, and there is no minimum investment requirement.

            "title": "How Bond Market Pricing Works",
            "content": "The U.S. bond market is like baseball \u2013\u00a0you have to understand and appreciate the rules and strategies, or else it will seem\u00a0boring. It's also like baseball in that its rules and pricing conventions have evolved and can seem esoteric at times. The Major League Baseball's official rule book has thousands of words just to cover the rules of what the pitcher can and cannot do. In this article, we're going to cover bond market pricing conventions in less than 1,800 words. Bond market classifications are briefly discussed, followed by yield calculations, pricing benchmarks, and pricing spreads. Basic knowledge of these bond pricing conventions will make the bond market seem as exciting as the best World Series baseball game. The bond market consists of a great number of issuers and types of securities. To talk about each specific type might fill an entire textbook; therefore, for the purposes of discussing how various bond market pricing conventions work, we make the following major bond classifications: Yield is the measure used most frequently to estimate or determine a bond's expected return. Yield is also used as a relative value measure between bonds. There are two primary yield measures that must be understood to understand how different bond market pricing conventions work: yield to maturity and spot rates. A yield-to-maturity calculation is made by determining the interest rate (discount rate) that will make the sum of a bond's cash flows, plus accrued interest, equal to the current price of the bond. This calculation has two important assumptions: first, that the bond will be held until maturity, and second, that the bond's cash flows can be reinvested at the yield to maturity. A spot rate calculation is made by determining the interest rate (discount rate) that makes the present value of a zero-coupon bond equal to its price. A series of spot rates must be calculated to price a coupon paying bond\u00a0\u2013 each cash flow must be discounted using the appropriate spot rate, such that the sum of the present values of each cash flow equals the price. As we discuss below, spot rates are most often used as a building block in relative value comparisons for certain types of bonds. Most bonds are priced relative to a benchmark. This is where bond market pricing gets a little tricky. Different bond classifications, as we have defined them above, use different pricing benchmarks. Some of the most common pricing benchmarks are on-the-run U.S. Treasuries (the most current series). Many bonds are priced relative to a specific Treasury bond. For example, the on-the-run 10-year Treasury might be used as the pricing benchmark for a 10-year corporate bond issue. When the maturity of a bond cannot be known with exactness because of call or put features, the bond is frequently priced to a benchmark curve. This is because the estimated maturity of the callable or put-able bond most likely does not coincide exactly with the maturity of a specific Treasury. Benchmark pricing curves are constructed using the yields of underlying securities with maturities from three months to 30 years. Several different benchmark interest rates or securities are used to construct benchmark pricing curves. Because there are gaps in the maturities of securities used to construct a curve, yields must be interpolated between the observable yields. For example, one of the most commonly used benchmark curves is the on-the-run U.S. Treasury curve, which is constructed using the most recently issued U.S. Treasury bonds, notes, and bills. Because securities are only issued by the U.S. Treasury with three-month, six-month, two-year, three-year, five-year, 10-year and 30-year maturities, the yields of theoretical bonds with maturities that lay between those maturities must be interpolated. This Treasury curve is known as the interpolated yield curve (or I-curve) by bond market participants. A bond's yield relative to the yield of its benchmark is called a spread. The spread is used both as a pricing mechanism and as a relative value comparison between bonds. For example, a trader might say that a certain corporate bond is trading at a spread of 75 basis points above the 10-year Treasury. This means that the yield to maturity of that bond is 0.75% greater than the yield to maturity of the on-the-run 10-year Treasury. Notably, if\u00a0a different corporate bond with the same credit rating, outlook and duration were trading at a spread of 90 basis points on a relative value basis, the second bond would be a better buy. There are different types of spread calculations used for the different pricing benchmarks. The four primary yield spread calculations are: High-yield bonds are usually priced at a nominal yield spread to a specific on-the-run U.S. Treasury bond. However, sometimes when the credit rating and outlook of a high-yield bond deteriorates, the bond will start to trade at an actual dollar price. For example, such a bond trades at $75.875, as opposed to 500 basis points over the 10-year Treasury. A corporate bond is usually priced at a nominal yield spread to a specific on-the-run U.S. Treasury bond that matches its maturity. For example, 10-year corporate bonds are priced to the 10-year Treasury. There are many different types of MBS. Many of them trade at a nominal yield spread at their weighted average life to the U.S. Treasury I-curve. Some adjustable-rate MBS trade at a DM, others trade at a Z-spread. Some CMOs trade at a nominal yield spread to a specific Treasury. For example, a 10-year planned amortization class bond might trade at a nominal yield spread to the on-the-run 10-year Treasury, or a\u00a0Z-bond might trade at a nominal yield spread to the on-the-run 30-year Treasury. Because MBS have embedded call options (borrowers have the free option of prepaying their mortgages), they are frequently evaluated using an OAS. ABS frequently trade at a nominal yield spread at their weighted average life to the swap curve. Agencies frequently trade at a nominal yield spread to a specific Treasury, such as the on-the-run 10-year Treasury. Callable agencies are sometimes evaluated based on an OAS where the spot rate curve(s) are derived from the yields on non-callable agencies. Because of the tax advantages of municipal bonds (usually not taxable), their yields are not as highly correlated with U.S. Treasury yields as other bonds. Therefore, munis frequently trade on an outright yield to maturity or even a dollar price. However, a muni's yield as a ratio to a benchmark Treasury yield is sometimes used as a relative value measure. Like the MBS and ABS that frequently back CDOs, there are many different pricing benchmarks and yield measures used to price CDOs. The eurodollar curve is sometimes used as a benchmark. Discount margins are used on floating rate tranches. OAS calculations are made for relative value analysis. Bond market pricing conventions are a little bit tricky, but like baseball rules, understanding the basics removes some of the ambiguity and may even make it enjoyable. Bond pricing is really just a matter of identifying a pricing benchmark, determining a spread and understanding the difference between two basic yield calculations: yield to maturity and spot rates. With that knowledge, understanding how various types of bonds are priced shouldn't be intimidating.

            "title": "Money Market Funds vs. Short-Term Bonds: What's the Difference?",
            "content": "satapatms/Getty Images Money market funds and short-term bonds have many similarities, but they also differ in several ways. They're both excellent savings vehicles on a short-term basis. Both are liquid, easily accessible, and relatively safe securities. But these investments can involve fees and they may lose value and decrease an investor's purchasing power. The money market is part of the fixed-income market that specializes in short-term debt securities that mature in less than one year. Most money market investments mature in three months or less. These are considered to be cash investments because of their quick maturity dates. Money market securities are issued by governments, financial institutions, and large corporations as promises to repay debts. They're considered extremely safe and conservative, especially during volatile times. Access to the money market is typically obtained through money market mutual funds or a money market bank account in which thousands of investors are pooled to buy money market securities on the investors\u2019 behalf. Shares can be bought or sold as desired, often through check-writing privileges. A minimum balance is typically required and a limited number of monthly transactions are allowed. The net asset value (NAV) typically stays around $1 per share, so only the yield fluctuates. Lower returns are realized when compared to other investments because of the liquidity of the money market. Purchasing power is limited, especially when inflation increases. A penalty may be assessed if an account drops below a minimum balance or if the number of monthly transactions is exceeded. Fees can take away much of the profit with such limited returns. Shares are not guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), or by any other agency unless an account is opened at a bank or credit union. Bonds have much in common with money market securities. A bond is issued by a government or corporation as a promise to pay back money borrowed to finance specific projects and activities. More money is necessary than the average bank can provide in such cases, which is why organizations turn to the public for assistance. Buying a bond effectively means giving the issuer a loan for a set duration. The issuer pays a predetermined interest rate at set intervals until the bond matures. The issuer then pays back the bond\u2019s face value at maturity. A higher interest rate generally means a higher risk of complete repayment with interest. Most bonds can be bought through a full-service or discount brokerage. Government agencies sell government bonds online and deposit payments electronically. Some financial institutions also transact government securities with their clients. Short-term bonds can be relatively predictable, low-risk income. Stronger returns can be realized when compared to money markets. Some bonds even come tax-free. A short-term bond offers a higher potential yield than money market funds. Bonds with quicker maturity rates are also typically less sensitive to increasing or decreasing interest rates\u00a0than other securities. Buying and holding a bond until it's due means receiving the principal and interest according to the stated rate. The bond owner could lose money if interest rates go up, in the sense of opportunity cost by having the money tied up in the bond rather than invested elsewhere. Funds that hold a high concentration of government securities are considered by many to be the safest, particularly if they hold Treasuries, which are backed by the government and therefore carry a lesser risk of default. A short-term bond will typically mature within no more than three years. A long-term bond may not mature until after 10 years. The bond's \"coupon\" or interest should be paid out a few times a year in either case. Deciding between them can depend on your goals and whether you're investing for the long-term or to achieve something that's on a closer horizon. Bonds carry more risk than money market funds. A bond's lender may not be able to make interest or principal payments on time, or the bond may be paid off early with the remaining interest payments lost. The bond may be called, paid off, and reissued at a lower rate if interest rates go down, resulting in lost income for the bond owner. There are both pros and cons to investing in money market funds and short-term bonds. Money market accounts are excellent for emergency funds\u00a0because account values typically remain stable or slightly increase in value. Limited transactions discourage removing funds but the money is nonetheless available when it's needed. Short-term bonds typically yield higher interest rates than money market funds, so the potential to earn more income over time is greater. Overall, short-term bonds appear to be a better investment than money market funds.

            "title": "Marketweight: What It Means, How It Works",
            "content": "Marketweight refers to the value rating given to a fixed-income instrument if it's credit spread is aligned with market expectations. The marketweight ranking system gives a subjective estimate of the accuracy of a fixed-income instrument's current credit spread which can then be used by an investor to determine whether that instrument is an attractive investment. The system includes three ranks - marketweight, overweight and underweight. The marketweight rating indicates that the current credit spread of an instrument is in line with market expectations. Essentially, a fixed-income security deemed to be marketweight is said to offer a credit spread that's at or near the market's consensus. Just as stocks may have a buy, sell or hold recommendation, this credit rating system will rate a debt instrument as overweight, underweight or marketweight. Being marketweight is similar to having a hold rating, whereas being overweight or underweight is equivalent to the buy and sell titles, respectively. Analysts will determine whether the current credit spread is an appropriate measure of risk for the investment and place a recommendation accordingly. Just as equity securities, fixed-income instruments are separated by several categories. These factors include, among others, credit risk (or credit rating), geography, industry, yield, and maturity. Fixed-income securities add another layer of consideration for contingencies, such as call-options and convertibility, that could further impact portfolio weighting decisions. Fixed-income instruments such as investment-grade bonds might be described as being held at marketweight, meaning a portfolio is neither overweight nor underweight (allocated to) investment-grade bonds relative to a common benchmark. When a portfolio manager has a particular view, such as a bullish stance on bonds from the industrials sector, a portfolio can be slanted from the market's consensus by overweighting the portfolio to an overweight position in industrials bonds."

            "title": "Top 4 Strategies for Managing a Bond Portfolio",
            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. To the casual observer, bond investing would appear to be as simple as buying the bond with the highest yield and holding onto it until it reaches maturity. While this works well when shopping for a certificate of deposit (CD) at the local bank, it doesn't work in the wider world of debt investing. A number of options are available for structuring a bond portfolio, and each strategy comes with its own risk and reward tradeoffs. The four principal strategies used to manage bond portfolios are: Passive investing is for investors who want predictable income. Active investing is for investors who want to make bets on the future. Indexation and immunization fall in the middle. They offer some predictability, but not as much as a passive strategy will produce. The passive buy-and-hold investor is looking to maximize the income-generating properties of bonds. Buy and hold involves purchasing individual bonds and holding them to maturity. To the passive investor, bonds are a safe, predictable source of income. The cash flow can contribute immediately to the investor's income or can be reinvested in other bonds or other assets. In a passive strategy, there are no assumptions made as to the direction of future interest rates and any changes in the current value of the bond due to shifts in the yield are not important. The bond may be originally purchased at a premium or a discount while assuming that full par will be received upon maturity. The only variation in total return from the actual coupon yield is the reinvestment of the coupons as they occur. On the surface, this may appear to be a lazy style of investing. In reality, passive bond portfolios provide stable anchors in rough financial storms. They minimize or eliminate transaction costs, and if originally implemented during a period of relatively high-interest rates, they have a decent chance of outperforming active strategies. A passive strategy works best with very high-quality, non-callable bonds like government or investment-grade corporate or municipal bonds. These types of bonds are well suited for a buy-and-hold strategy as they minimize the risk associated with changes in the investor's income stream due to embedded options, which are written into the bond's covenants at issue and stay with the bond for life. Like the stated coupon, call and put features embedded in a bond allow the issuer to act on those options under specified market conditions. Company A issues $100 million in bonds at a 5% coupon rate to the public market; the bonds are completely sold out at issue. There is a call feature in the bonds' covenants that allows the lender to call (recall) the bonds if rates fall enough to reissue the bonds at a lower prevailing interest rate. Three years later, the prevailing interest rate is 3%. Due to the company's good credit rating, it is able to buy back the bonds at a predetermined price and reissue them at a 3% coupon rate. This is good for the lender but bad for the borrower. Bond laddering is one of the most common forms of passive bond investing. The investor divides the portfolio into equal parts, then buys bonds that mature on different dates. Each maturity date represents a \"rung\" on the ladder, which is the investor's entire time horizon. As the bonds reach maturity, the proceeds are reinvested at the currently available rate. This strategy reduces the impact of fluctuation in bond rates. Figure 1 is an example of a basic 10-year laddered $1 million bond portfolio with a stated coupon of 5%. Figure 1 Dividing the principal into equal parts provides a steady equal stream of cash flow each year. Bond investing is not as simple or predictable as it might seem to the casual observer. There are many ways to build a bond portfolio and each has its risks and rewards. Indexing is considered to be quasi-passive by design. The main objective of indexing a bond portfolio is to provide a return and risk characteristic closely tied to the targeted index. While this strategy carries some of the same characteristics of the passive buy-and-hold, it has some flexibility. Just like tracking a specific stock market index, a bond portfolio can be structured to mimic any published bond index. One common index mimicked by portfolio managers is the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Due to the size of this index, the strategy would work well with a large portfolio due to the number of bonds required to replicate the index. One also needs to consider the transaction costs associated with the original investment and the periodic rebalancing of the portfolio to reflect changes in the index. The immunization strategy has some of the characteristics of both active and passive strategies. It seeks to match the duration of assets and liabilities (such as discounted future cash flows required by the portfolio) to protect against interest rate fluctuations. By definition, pure immunization implies that a portfolio is invested for a defined return for a specific period of time regardless of any outside influences, such as changes in interest rates. Similar to indexing, the immunization strategy potentially gives up the upside potential of an active strategy for the assurance that the portfolio will achieve the intended desired return. As in the buy-and-hold strategy, the instruments best suited for this strategy are high-grade bonds with remote possibilities of default. The purest form of immunization would be to invest in a zero-coupon bond and match the maturity of the bond to the date on which the cash flow is expected to be needed. This eliminates any variability of return, positive or negative, associated with the reinvestment of cash flows. Duration, or the average life of a bond, is commonly used in immunization. It is a much more accurate predictive measure of a bond's volatility than maturity. The duration strategy is commonly used by insurance companies, pension funds, and banks to match the time horizon of their future liabilities with structured cash flows. It is one of the soundest strategies and can be used successfully by individuals. A pension fund might use an immunization strategy to plan for cash flows for an individual's retirement. The same individual could build a dedicated portfolio independently. The goal of active management is maximizing total return. Along with the enhanced opportunity for returns comes increased risk. Some examples of active styles include interest rate anticipation, timing, valuation, spread exploitation, and multiple interest rate scenarios. The basic premise of all active strategies is that the investor is willing to make bets on the future rather than settle for the potentially lower returns a passive strategy offers. A bond is essentially an IOU. When a corporation, a government, or some other agency wants to raise a sum of money, it might issue a round of bonds. Investors buy the bonds in return for a set amount of interest, usually paid in installments. When the bond reaches its maturity date, the issuer returns the original sum invested. High-quality bonds represent a reasonably safe alternative for the investor. \"High-quality\" means the bonds come with a rating of BBB- or better from one of the three major bond rating agencies. The return the investor will get is known up front. The rating indicates that the company is extremely likely to pay the interest and return the principal. When inflation rises, the interest rates on newly-issued bonds typically will increase in order to remain competitive. The same trend, however, causes the value of existing bonds to decrease on the secondary bond market. The existing bonds cannot compete with newer, higher-paying bonds. That is why it is often said that bond prices are inversely related to interest rates. Price fluctuations in the secondary bond market have no impact on the value of bonds being held to maturity by investors. An investor is highly unlikely to lose money on bonds as long as the bonds are investment quality, meaning they are rated BBB- or better. That is the reason that investors prize bonds. They provide a steady, reliable income with little chance of a loss of principle. The risk in bonds lies in the potential for missed opportunities. If an investor buys a one-year bond that pays 3.9 percent interest in March and new bonds issued four months later pay 4.3 percent, the investor has missed an opportunity for a better return. There are many strategies for investing in bonds that investors can employ. The buy-and-hold approach appeals to investors who are looking for income and are not willing to make predictions. The middle-of-the-road strategies include indexation and immunization, both of which offer some security and predictability. Then there is the active world, which is not for the casual investor. Each strategy has its place and when implemented correctly, can achieve the goals for which it was intended.

These bonds are considered among the most low-risk investments available, as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Unlike traditional savings bonds, I Bonds earn interest through a combination of a fixed rate, which remains constant throughout the life of the bond, and a variable inflation rate that is adjusted twice a year based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Most Series I bonds are issued electronically, but it is possible to purchase paper certificates with a minimum of $50 using your income tax refund, according to Treasury Direct. Series I bonds are non-marketable bonds that are part of the U.S. Treasury savings bond program designed to offer low-risk investments. Their non-marketable feature means they cannot be bought or sold in the secondary markets. The two types of interest that a Series I bond earns are an interest rate that is fixed for the life of the bond and an inflation rate that is adjusted each May and November based on changes in the non-seasonally adjusted consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U). I bonds are issued at a fixed interest rate for up to 30 years, plus a variable inflation rate that is adjusted each May and November. This gives the bondholder some protection from the effects of inflation. The fixed-rate component of the Series I bond is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury and is announced every six months on the first business day in May and the first business day in November. That fixed rate is then applied to all Series I bonds issued during the next six months, is compounded semiannually and does not change throughout the life of the bond. In addition to the fixed interest rate, the variable rate is announced twice a year in May and November and is determined by changes to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is used to gauge inflation in the U.S. economy. The change in the inflation rate is applied to the bond every six months from the bond's issue date. In effect, the interest paid on Series I bonds is variable and changes over time, making it difficult to forecast the value of the bonds years from today. The actual rate on the bond, known as the composite rate, is calculated by combining the fixed and inflation rates. The inflation rate impacts the fixed rate set on the bond. However, the minimum level that the interest rate on a Series I bond can fall to is zero, which is the floor placed on the bond by the Treasury. If the inflation rate is so negative that it would take away more than the fixed rate, the composite rate will be set at zero. The formula for calculating the composite rate is given as: Composite rate = fixed rate + (2 x semiannual inflation rate) + (fixed rate x semiannual inflation rate) For example, if the fixed rate is 0.30% and the semiannual inflation is -2.30%, the composite rate on the bond will be: However, since it is negative in this case, the composite ratio will be adjusted to 0%. 5.27% is the composite interest rate for I bonds issued November 1, 2023 to April 30, 2024. This includes a fixed rate portion of 1.30%. Inflation adjustments are made 2x each year, on May 1 and November 1. Essentially risk-free Inflation protection Interest is exempt from state and local taxes Interest can be tax-free if used for education Cannot be bought and sold on secondary market Limited dollar cap per person, per year Must be held for at least 1 year Forfeit 3 months interest if redeemed within 5 years Comparatively low interest rate vs. riskier investments One of the most significant benefits of Series I bonds is the exceptionally low risk associated with them. As they are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, investors can have confidence in the safety and stability of their principal investment. Another key advantage of I Bonds is their ability to protect purchasing power against inflation. The variable inflation rate component of the bond's interest rate is adjusted semi-annually based on changes in the CPI. This means that as inflation rises, the interest rate on I Bonds also increases, helping to preserve the real value of your investment over time. In terms of tax benefits, I Bonds offer several additional advantages. The interest earned on these bonds is usually exempt from state and local taxes, which can be particularly appealing to investors in high-tax states. Additionally, if the proceeds from I Bonds are used to pay for qualified higher education expenses, the interest may be exempt from federal income taxes as well. However, there are some drawbacks to consider before investing in I Bonds. With their safety comes a comparatively lower return, comparable to a high-interest savings account or certificate of deposit (CD). One main limitation is that these bonds cannot be bought or sold on the secondary market. This means that once you purchase an I Bond, you are committed to holding it until maturity or redeeming it with the Treasury, subject to certain restrictions. Liquidity is another factor to consider. I Bonds must be held for a minimum of one year before they can be redeemed, which may not be suitable for investors who require more flexible access to their funds. Furthermore, if I Bonds are redeemed within the first five years, investors will forfeit the most recent three months of interest as a penalty. Another potential downside is the purchase limit. Investors are limited to purchasing a maximum of $10,000 in electronic I Bonds per year for each Social Security Number (the minimum purchase amount is $25). An additional $5,000 may be purchased as paper I bonds. This cap may be restrictive for investors looking to allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to this type of investment. Lastly, while I Bonds offer a relatively attractive interest rate, especially during periods of high inflation, they may not provide the same long-term growth potential as other investment options, such as stocks or real estate. Investors should carefully consider their financial goals and risk tolerance when deciding whether to include I Bonds in their portfolio. Interest income for Series I bonds is taxable at the federal level, but not at the state and local levels. The series I bond is a zero-coupon bond, meaning that no interest is paid during the life of the bond. The interest is, instead, added back to the value of the bond and earns interest on interest. The bondholder has the option of selecting one of two methods of taxation\u2014the cash method or the accrual method. Under the cash method, tax is only applied when the bonds are redeemed. Therefore, a taxpayer that holds a bond for seven years before selling it will only be taxed at the time the bond is sold. Using the accrual method, on the other hand, taxes on the imputed interest earned are applied every year. Sometimes, the Series I bond income is tax-free at the federal level if it is used to pay for higher education. When you sell an I bond and use the proceeds to pay for qualified higher education expenses at an eligible institution in the same calendar year, the interest is exempt from federal income tax. When considering investing in U.S. savings bonds, investors often compare Series I Bonds and Series EE Bonds. While both bond types are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and offer a safe, low-risk investment option, there are several key differences between the two. One of the most significant differences between I Bonds and EE Bonds lies in how their interest rates are determined. I Bonds earn a combination of a fixed rate, which remains constant throughout the life of the bond, and a variable inflation rate that is adjusted twice a year based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This means that the interest rate on I Bonds can fluctuate over time, providing investors with protection against inflation. On the other hand, EE Bonds issued after May 2005 earn a fixed interest rate that remains the same for the life of the bond. This rate is determined at the time of purchase and is generally lower than the composite rate offered by I Bonds. However, EE Bonds come with a unique guarantee: if held for 20 years, they will double in value, effectively providing a 3.5% annual return. Both I Bonds and EE Bonds have purchase limits, but they differ slightly. Investors can purchase up to $10,000 in electronic I Bonds per year for each Social Security Number, with an additional $5,000 in paper I Bonds if using their tax refund. EE Bonds have an annual purchase limit of $10,000 in electronic form per Social Security Number, but there is no additional purchase limit for paper EE Bonds. I Bonds can be purchased in any denomination starting at $25, with a maximum of $10,000 per transaction. EE Bonds can be purchased in denominations ranging from $25 to $10,000. Both I Bonds and EE Bonds have a 30-year maturity period, composed of an original 20-year maturity followed by a 10-year extended maturity period. However, there are differences in their redemption rules. Both EE and I Bonds must be held for a minimum of one year before they can be redeemed, and if they are redeemed within the first five years, investors forfeit the most recent three months of interest. Both I Bonds and EE Bonds offer certain tax benefits. The interest earned on these bonds is subject to federal income tax but exempt from state and local taxes. Additionally, if the proceeds from either bond type are used to pay for qualified higher education expenses, the interest may be tax-free at the federal level. I Bonds are often favored by investors seeking protection against inflation, as their variable interest rate helps preserve purchasing power over time. They may be particularly attractive during periods of high inflation. EE Bonds, with their fixed interest rate and guaranteed doubling in value after 20 years, may appeal to investors with a longer investment horizon who prioritize predictable returns. U.S. savings bonds, including Series I bonds, can only be purchased online from the U.S. Treasury, using the TreasuryDirect website. You can also use your federal tax refund to purchase Series I bonds. Suppose an investor purchases $10,000 worth of I Bonds when the composite rate is 5.27%. This rate includes both the fixed rate and the variable inflation rate.If the composite rate remains at 5.27% for the entire year, and the interest is compounded semiannually, the investor would earn: Year 1 Interest = $10,000 \u00d7 (1 + 0.0527/2)^2 - $10,000= $10,000 \u00d7 (1.02635)^2 - $10,000= $10,000 \u00d7 1.0535 - $10,000= $535 In this scenario, the investor would earn approximately $535 in interest during the first year. However, it's essential to keep in mind that the composite rate for I Bonds is not fixed and can change every six months based on the variable inflation rate. If the composite rate fluctuates, the actual interest earned may be higher or lower than in this example. Also note that early redemptions will incur penalties. If you use your income tax refund to purchase U.S. savings bonds, complete and file IRS Form 8888 with your tax return. The IRS will arrange for your U.S. savings bonds to be mailed to you. The composite rate for I bonds will depend on when they were issued and the inflation rates that they have experienced. Therefore, you will need to consult a table showing the historical fixed and variable components depending on the issue date. These bonds are issued at face value with a 30-year final maturity: a 20-year original maturity period immediately followed by a 10-year extended maturity period. Series I Bonds offer a unique investment opportunity for those seeking a low-risk, inflation-protected investment backed by the U.S. government. With a combination of a fixed rate and a variable inflation rate, I Bonds can help preserve purchasing power over time, making them an attractive option for risk-averse investors. However, investors should be aware of the limitations, such as the annual purchase limit, the one-year minimum holding period, and the three-month interest penalty if redeemed within the first five years. Additionally, while I Bonds offer the potential for competitive returns during periods of high inflation, they may not provide the same long-term growth prospects as other investment vehicles, such as stocks, corporate bonds, or real estate. Ultimately, the decision to invest in I Bonds should be based on an individual's financial goals, risk tolerance, and overall investment strategy.

            "title": "Bond Funds vs. Bond ETFs: What's the Difference?",
            "content": "Not sure which to choose? Here are some things to consider about bond funds vs. bond ETFs. Moyo Studio / Getty Images Bond mutual funds (sometimes known simply as bond funds) and bond ETFs (or exchange-traded funds) both feature a basket of bonds or other debt instruments - but there are some key differences that investors should be aware of. Bond funds are mutual funds that pool capital from investors, from which a fund manager allocates that capital to various fixed-income securities. A bond ETF instead tracks an index of bonds with the goal of matching the returns from the underlying index. Bond funds and bond ETFs share several characteristics, including diversification via portfolios that hold numerous bonds. Both funds and ETFs have smaller minimum required investments that would be necessary to achieve the same level of diversification by purchasing individual bonds in constructing a portfolio. Before comparing bond funds and bond ETFs, it is worth taking a few moments to review the reasons why investors buy bonds. Most investors put bonds in a portfolio to generate income. A bond is a debt instrument that typically pays an interest rate, called a coupon rate each year to the bondholder. Although buying and selling bonds to generate a profit from fluctuations in their prices is a viable strategy, most investors invest in them for their interest payments. Investors also buy bonds for risk-related reasons, as they seek to store their money in an investment that is less volatile than stocks. Volatility is the extent to which a security's price fluctuates over time. Both bond funds and bond ETFs can pay dividends, which are cash payments from companies for investing in their securities. Both types of funds offer a wide variety of investment choices ranging from high-quality government bonds to low-quality corporate bonds and everything in between. Both funds and ETFs can also be purchased and sold through a brokerage account in exchange for a small per-trade fee. Despite these similarities, bond funds and bond ETFs have unique, unshared characteristics. All else being equal, ETFs are usually more flexible. However, this flexibility may not be the best case in all situations. For example, retirement funds want stability, so intraday trading flexibility is actually not entirely ideal. Mutual funds have been investing in bonds for many years. Some of the oldest balanced funds, which include allocations to both stock and bonds, date back to the late 1920s. Accordingly, a large number of bond funds in existence offer a significant variety of investment options. These include both index funds, which seek to replicate various benchmarks and make no effort to outperform those benchmarks, and actively managed funds, which seek to beat their benchmarks. Actively managed funds also employ credit analysts to conduct research into the credit quality of the bonds the fund purchases to minimize the risk of purchasing bonds that are likely to default. Default occurs when the issuer of the bond is unable to make interest payments or pay back the original amount invested due to financial difficulty. Each bond is assigned a credit quality grade by credit rating agencies that assess the financial viability of the issuer and the likelihood of default. Bond funds are available in two different structures: open-ended funds\u00a0and closed-end funds. Open-ended funds can be bought directly from fund providers, which means they do not need to be purchased through a brokerage account. If purchased directly, the brokerage commission fee can be avoided. Similarly, bond funds can be sold back to the fund company that issued the shares, making them highly liquid or easily bought and sold. In addition, open-ended funds are priced and traded once a day, after the market closes and each fund\u2019s net asset value (NAV) is determined. The trading price is a direct reflection of the NAV, which is based on the value of the bonds in the portfolio. Open-ended funds do not trade at a premium or a discount, making it easy and predictable to determine precisely how much a fund\u2019s shares will generate if sold. A bond sold at a premium has a higher market price than its original face value amount while a discount is when a bond is trading at a lower price than its face value. Notably, some bond funds charge an extra fee if they are sold prior to a certain minimum required holding period (often 90 days), as the fund company wishes to minimize the expenses associated with frequent trading. Bond funds do not reveal their underlying holdings on a daily basis. They generally release holdings on a semi-annual basis, with some funds reporting monthly. The lack of transparency makes it difficult for investors to determine the precise composition of their portfolios at any given time. Bond ETFs are a far newer entrant to the market when compared to mutual funds, with iShares launching the first bond ETF in 2002. Most of these offerings seek to replicate various bond indices, although a growing number of actively managed products are also available. Because of their passive approach, ETFs often have lower fees than their mutual fund counterparts, potentially making them the more attractive choice to some investors all else being equal. Bond ETFs operate much like closed-end funds, in that they are purchased through a brokerage account rather than directly from a fund company. Likewise, when an investor wishes to sell, ETFs must be traded on the open market, meaning that a buyer must be found because the fund company will not purchase the shares as they would for open-ended mutual funds. Like stocks, ETFs trade throughout the day. The prices for shares can fluctuate moment by moment and may vary quite a bit over the course of trading. Extremes in price fluctuation have been seen during market anomalies, such as the so-called Flash Crash\u00a0of 2010. Shares can also trade at a premium or a discount to the underlying net asset value of the holdings. While significant deviations in value are relatively infrequent, they are not impossible. Deviations may be of particular concern during crisis periods, for example, if a large number of investors are seeking to sell bonds. In such events, an ETF's price may reflect a discount to NAV because the ETF provider is not certain that existing holdings could be sold at their current stated net asset value. Bond ETFs usually do not have a minimum required holding period, meaning that there is usually no penalty imposed for selling rapidly after making a purchase. Keep in mind there may be restrictions on then withdrawing the proceeds based on how that bond ETF is being held. For example, holding a bond ETF within a retirement vehicle may limit when those funds can be accessed without penalty fees or taxes (even though you can still sell). They can also be bought on margin and sold short, offering significantly greater flexibility in terms of trading than open-ended mutual funds. Margin involves borrowing money or securities from a broker to invest. Also, unlike mutual funds, bond ETFs reveal their underlying holdings on a daily basis, giving investors complete transparency. Both bond funds and bond ETFs have similarities, though the holdings within the funds and their fees charged to investors can vary. The decision over whether to purchase a bond fund or a bond ETF usually depends on the investment objective of the investor.\u00a0If you want active management, bond mutual funds offer more choices. If you plan to buy and sell frequently, bond ETFs are a good choice. For long-term, buy-and-hold investors, bond mutual funds, and bond ETFs can meet your needs, but it's best to do your research as to the holdings in each fund. If transparency is important, bond ETFs allow you to see the holdings within the fund at any given moment. However, if you're concerned about not being able to sell your ETF investment due to the lack of buyers in the market, a bond fund might be a better choice since you'll be able to sell your holdings back to the fund issuer. As with most investment decisions, it's important to do your research and speak with your broker or financial advisor. Bond ETFs often have lower expense ratios than bond funds. This is because ETFs have passive management. Bond funds may have higher expenses because of the active management and the costs associated with mutual fund operations. Both bond funds and bond ETFs can offer suitable investment opportunities, but their appeal will depend on your personal investment goals, risk tolerance, and the specifics of your financial strategy. Bond funds stand out for those seeking diversified exposure across various types of bonds, such as government, municipal, and corporate bonds, within a single investment. They're particularly attractive for investors aiming for regular income and lower volatility compared to stocks. The professional management of these funds can also be a plus for investors who prefer to delegate investment decisions. However, it's important to be mindful of the potential for higher fees, especially with actively managed funds, and the impact of interest rate changes on fund values. Bond ETFs, on the other hand, combine the diversified exposure of bond funds with the flexibility and liquidity of stocks. They are traded on exchanges throughout the trading day, offering real-time pricing and the ability to respond swiftly to market changes. With generally lower expense ratios than mutual funds, bond ETFs are a cost-effective way to access the bond market. Their daily transparency and the ease of tracking an index can be particularly appealing for those who value cost efficiency and operational simplicity. However, like bond funds, bond ETFs are also subject to market risk, including changes in interest rates and credit risk. Bond funds may have minimum investment requirements, which can vary widely from fund to fund. Some may have minimum investments of a few thousand dollars. Bond ETFs, on the other hand, usually do not have minimum investment requirements. Yes, both bond funds and bond ETFs can be used to generate income. They both invest in bonds which typically pay periodic interest or coupon payments. Bond ETFs often provide better transparency because they have to disclose their holdings on a daily basis. Investors can see exactly what bonds are held within the ETF. Meanwhile, bond funds often disclose their holdings less frequently, perhaps only disclosing information on a quarterly basis to meet external reporting requirements. Bond ETFs can lose value due to several factors, including changes in interest rates, credit risk, and market sentiment. When interest rates rise, the prices of existing bonds, which have lower interest rates compared to new bonds, tend to fall. Since a bond ETF holds many such bonds, its value can decrease as well. The duration of the ETF's portfolio will tell you how sensitive it is to interest rate changes. Additionally, if the creditworthiness of the bonds within the ETF deteriorates, this can also lead to a decrease in the ETF\u2019s value. It's important to remember that while bond ETFs offer liquidity and the flexibility of trading like stocks, they are not immune to the risks inherent in the bond market. Investing in a bond fund is not necessarily riskier than investing in a bond. If you decide to invest in a bond fund, it is important that you understand what the fund is invested in. Read the fund's stated objectives to ensure that they are in line with your risk profile. Bond funds and bond ETFs are two investment options that pool funds into a diversified, fixed-income portfolio. However, there are substantial differences in how each operates, including whether or not each option can trade intraday and whether or not each option is tax-efficient.

            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. A coupon bond, also referred to as a bearer bond or bond coupon, is a debt obligation with coupons attached that represent semiannual interest payments. With coupon bonds, there are no records of the purchaser kept by the issuer; the purchaser's name is also not printed on any kind of certificate. Bondholders receive these coupons during the period between the issuance of the bond and the maturity of the bond. Coupon bonds are rare since most modern bonds are not issued in certificate or coupon form. Instead, bonds are formed electronically, though some holders still prefer to own paper certificates. For this reason, the coupon bond simply refers to the rate it projects rather than its physical nature in the form of certificates or coupons. Typical bonds consist of semi-annual payments costing $25 per coupon. Coupons are usually described according to the coupon rate. The yield the coupon bond pays on the date of its issuance is called the coupon rate. The value of the coupon rate may change. Bonds with higher coupon rates are more attractive for investors since they provide higher yields. The coupon rate is calculated by taking the sum of all the coupons paid per year and dividing it with the bond's face value. If an investor purchases a $1,000 ABC Company coupon bond and the coupon rate is 5%, the issuer provides the investor with a 5% interest every year. This means the investor gets $50, the face value of the bond derived from multiplying $1,000 by 0.05, every year. For the investor to claim his interest on the bond, he simply takes the corresponding coupon from the provided bond certificate and gives it to an agent of the issuing institution. Coupon bonds are usually bearer bonds. Anyone who provides the necessary coupons to the issuer can receive the interest payment regardless of whether that person is the actual owner of the bond. For this reason, coupon bonds present a lot of opportunities for tax evasion and other fraudulent acts. Modern bonds are typically registered bonds with physical certificates that provide the terms of the debt and the name of the registered holder who receives interest payments automatically from the issuing institution. Some bonds are in the form of book-entry bonds, which are electronically registered and linked to the issuer and its investors. In book-entry bonds, the investor gets receipts instead of certificates. Investors also get accounts handled by financial institutions. They are able to receive their interest payments through these accounts."

Despite its name, it has no particular connection to Europe or the euro currency. Due to this external currency characteristic, these types of bonds\u00a0are also known as external bonds. The \"euro\" in eurobond is meant to imply external. These eurobonds\u00a0should not be confused with Eurobonds with a capital \"E.\" When capitalized, the word defines bonds issued by the European Union and\u00a0European governments. The names of eurobonds (small \"e\") reflect the currency in which they are denominated.\u00a0For example, a U.K.-based company might issue a U.S. dollar-denominated eurodollar bond in Japan. Or, an international financial syndicate could issue euroyen bonds in Singapore, which are denominated in Japanese yen. Private organizations, international syndicates, and even governments\u00a0in need of foreign-denominated money for a specified length of time find eurobonds suitable to their needs.\u00a0Eurobonds are usually offered at fixed interest rates, even if they are issued for long periods of time. For example, say a company like Molson Coors wants to enter a new\u00a0market\u00a0by establishing a manufacturing facility in India.\u00a0Expenses for the facility will require a large amount of capital in the local currency, the Indian rupee (INR). As it is new to India, the company may not have the necessary credit in the Indian markets, which can\u00a0lead to a high cost\u00a0for borrowing locally.\u00a0Molson Coors decides to source the money locally\u00a0and\u00a0issues a rupee-denominated eurobond in the U.S. Investors with\u00a0Indian rupees in their U.S.-based accounts may purchase the\u00a0bond, effectively loaning money in Indian rupees to the company. The eurobond is denominated in a foreign currency but launched in a nation with a strong currency. That keeps them highly liquid for their investors. The North American company collects this capital and floats a subsidiary company locally in India. The collected capital, in rupees, is transferred to the local Indian subsidiary by the parent company. The plant becomes operational, and the proceeds are used to pay the interest to bondholders. There are a number of benefits to issuing eurobonds\u00a0rather than domestic bonds for a project of this type: For the investor, eurobonds can offer diversification with a smaller degree of risk. They are investing in a solid and familiar local company that is expanding its business into an emerging market. Also, eurobonds are denominated in foreign currencies but launched in nations with strong currencies. That keeps them highly liquid for their local investors. For example, an Indian rupee eurodollar bond issued in the U.K. with par value of 10,000 Indian rupees will cost a U.K. investor the equivalent of about 92 British pounds at the prevailing exchange rate as of October 24, 2024.

            "content": "Investopedia / Laura Porter A half stock is a security sold with a par value that is 50% of what is considered to be the standard price. The par value refers to the face value of a bond, or in some cases, a stock. Half stock can be either common stock or preferred stock and, other than the reduced par value, acts as a regular share of stock. The valuation of a share of common stock is often the same for both a regular share of stock and half stock, as much of the stock's value is related to growth potential. Par value is an important factor in determining the dividend of a share of stock, making it more important for preferred stock. Additionally, preferred stock may have a higher claim on the proceeds of a company that was liquidated. A half stock share of preferred stock would potentially receive less in liquidation. Par value is more commonly a term used in bonds, meaning the face value of a bond, representing the principal amount that the lender, or investor, is lending to the borrower, or issuer. In terms of stock, shares are also assigned a par value, but the number is usually small and arbitrary, such as $0.01 per share. Preferred stock is typically given a higher value because it is used to calculate dividends. Common stock and preferred stock have small, however, significant differences. Common stock is a security that represents ownership in a corporation. Holders of common stock elect the company's board of directors and vote on corporate policy. But common shareholders are low on the ladder of priority in terms of ownership. In the event of\u00a0liquidation, common shareholders have the right to a company's assets only after bondholders, preferred shareholders, and other debt holders have been paid in full. Preferred stock is a level of ownership in a corporation that has a higher claim on its assets and earnings than common stock. With common stock, there is no obligation for a company to offer dividends. With preferred stock, shareholders expect to receive dividends. The promise of dividends is a selling feature, intrinsic to the security. Preferred shares generally have a\u00a0dividend\u00a0that must be paid out before dividends to common shareholders, and the shares usually do not carry voting rights. Preferred stock is far more uncommon than common stock. Examples of preferred stock include shares issued by Bank of America (BAC) and MetLife (MET).\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff A half stock has a par value that is typically half of what is considered normal. So, let's say the par value of e-commerce company BuySell's preferred stock is $100. However, the company decides that it also wants to issue some half stock. The half stock is still considered to be preferred stock and is still ranked higher on the priority ladder than common stock, but because it is half stock, it will pay out a lesser dividend to shareholders and give the owners fewer claims on assets should the company need to declare bankruptcy and liquidate. BuySell issues preferred stock with a par value of $50, making it half stock. Bank of America. \"Preferred Stock.\" Accessed April 11, 2021. MetLife. \"2019 10-K,\" Page 271.

Bid bonds are often used for construction jobs or other projects with similar bid-based selection processes. The function of the bid bond is to provide a guarantee to the project owner that the bidder will complete the work if selected. The existence of a bid bond gives the owner assurance that the bidder has the financial means to accept the job for the price quoted in the bid. Bid bonds ensure that contractors can comply with bid contracts and will fulfill their job responsibilities at agreed prices. Most public construction contracts require contractors or subcontractors to secure their bids by providing bonds that serve as a means of legal and financial protection to the client. Without bid bonds, project owners would have no way of guaranteeing that the bidder they select for a project would be able to complete the job properly. For example, an underfunded bidder might run into cash flow problems along the way. Bid bonds also help clients avoid frivolous bids, which saves time when analyzing and choosing contractors. While most project owners typically require between 5% and 10% of the tender price upfront as a penalty sum, federally funded projects require 20% of the bid. The cost of the bond depends on several factors, including the jurisdiction of the project work, bid amount, and contractual terms. For example, a contractor that is making a $250,000 bid to provide roofing for an elementary school will have to submit a bid bond of $50,000. This bid bond is required along with a proposal to be taken seriously as a contender for a federal contract. A bid bond can be a written guarantee made out by a third-party guarantor and submitted to a client or project owner. The bid bond affirms that the contractor has the required funds necessary to carry out the project. Typically, bid bonds are submitted as a cash deposit by contractors for a tendered bid. A contractor purchases a bid bond from a surety, which carries out extensive financial and background checks on a contractor before approving the bond. Several factors determine whether a contractor will be issued a bid bond. They include the company's credit history and the number of years of experience in the field. Financial statements may also be examined to determine the overall financial health of the company. A surety bond involves three primary players: the financial\u00a0guarantor or surety\u00a0of a construction bond, guaranteeing the obligee that the contractor (called the principal) will act in accordance with the terms established by the bond. Both the surety and contractor are held liable if the contractor fails to abide by any of the contract's conditions. A bid bond is replaced by a performance bond when a bid is accepted and the contractor proceeds to work on the project. A performance bond protects a client from a contractor's failure to perform according to the contractual terms. If the work done by a contractor is poor or defective, a project owner can make a claim against the performance bond. The bond provides compensation for the cost of redoing or correcting the job. If the contractor does not meet the obligations of the bid bond, the contractor and the surety are held jointly and severally liable for the bond. A client will usually opt for the lowest bidder since it will mean reduced costs for the company. If a contractor wins the bid but decides not to execute the contract for one reason or another, the client will be forced to award the second-lowest bidder the contract and pay more. In this instance, the project owner can make a claim against the full or partial amount of the bid bond. A bid bond is thus an indemnity bond that protects a client if a winning bidder fails to execute the contract or provide the required performance bonds. The amount claimed against a bid bond typically covers the difference between the lowest bid and the next lowest bid. This difference will be paid by the bonding company or surety, which may sue the contractor to recover the costs. Whether the surety can sue the contractor depends on the terms of the bid bond. A contract bid is most commonly associated with a proposal and price submitted by a contractor or service provider to a soliciting firm for a business opportunity involving construction or renovation projects. While having good credit is always helpful in matters like these, those with poor credit may still be able to obtain bid bonds from companies that agree to do so, but these will often be more costly to obtain. Once a project is successfully completed per the contract, the bid bond amount is returned. The three main types of construction bonds are bid, performance, and payment.

            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. FG Trade / Getty Images A total bond fund is a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund that seeks to replicate a broad bond index. A total bond fund owns many securities across a range of maturities, from both public and private sectors. The most common index used as a benchmark is the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, which captures Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds and high-grade mortgage-backed securities. Total bond funds may invest in bonds of similar maturity, class, and rating to replicate an issue that is not available for purchase by the fund. These restrictions exist because of the diversity and relative illiquidity of the bond markets compared with equities markets. It is important for a total bond fund to have a similar interest rate and maturity to the base index. Total bond fund portfolios actually have a bit more freedom in their security selection than a total stock fund does. Because individual bond issues have less liquidity than stocks, some funds have to bypass certain issues that are in the benchmark index while choosing other bonds that are not in the index. Many total bond funds have a small allocation, around 20% of assets, from which bonds can be chosen at the discretion of the managers and held in assets outside the Barclays Index, such as international bonds, derivatives and lower-rated corporate paper. This allows fund managers a chance to invest in some noncorrelated assets while keeping the overall risk profile of the fund within the same range as the Barclays Index. The most important risk metrics to keep close to the index are the maturity, or more specifically the weighted average maturity, as well as the duration, or sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The Vanguard Total Bond Market Index is designed to provide broad exposure to U.S. investment-grade bonds. Reflecting this goal, the fund invests about 30% in corporate bonds and 70% in U.S. government bonds of all maturities (short-, intermediate-, and long-term issues). As of June 2022, the fund had a 10-year annualized return of 1.34%. As with other bond funds, one of the risks of the fund is that increases in interest rates may cause the price of the bonds in the portfolio to decrease\u2014pricing the fund\u2019s NAV lower. Because the fund invests in all segments and maturities of the fixed income market, investors may consider the fund their core bond holding."

He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Call protection is a provision of some bonds that prohibits the issuer from buying it back for a specified period of time. The period during which the bond is protected is known as the deferment period or the cushion. Bonds with call protection are usually referred to as deferred callable bonds. A bond is a fixed income security that is used by a company or a government to raise money. The funds raised by selling the bonds are typically intended for use in a specific project. Bonds have a maturity date which is the date on which the principal investment is repaid to the bondholders. As compensation for lending their money, the investors receive interest payments in increments from the issuer until the bond reaches its maturity or expiration date. These interest payments are known as coupon payments and are fixed for the duration of the bond contract until the bond reaches its maturity or expiration date. At that time, the investor's principal is returned. High-quality bonds are known as relatively risk-free investments, but in fact, both the issuer and the buyer are taking on some risk. If interest rates in general rise during the life span of the bond, the investor has lost an opportunity to get a better return for the money. If interest rates fall, the company or government that issued the bond is losing an opportunity to borrow money at a cheaper cost. Callable bonds may have ten years of call protection, while call protection on utility bonds is typically limited to five years. Companies protect themselves from this risk by issuing callable bonds. This means they can choose to buy back the bonds at their full face value or with a stated premium over face value and then issue new bonds at a lower rate of interest. Companies will typically call back their bonds when prevailing interest rates decrease unless there is call protection in place. That stipulation allows the investor some time to take advantage of any appreciation in the value of their bonds. Call protection can be extremely beneficial for bondholders when interest rates are falling. It means that investors will have a minimum number of years, regardless of how poor the debt market becomes, to reap the benefits of the security. Call protection is typically stipulated in a bond indenture. Callable corporate and municipal bonds usually have ten years of call protection, while protection on utility bonds is often limited to five years. Let's assume a callable corporate bond was issued today with a 4% coupon and a maturity date set at 15 years from now. If the first call on the bond is ten years, and interest rates go down to 3% in the next five years, the issuer cannot call the bond because its investors are protected for 10 years. However, if interest rates decline after ten years, the borrower is within its rights to trigger the call option provision on the bonds. The bond may be redeemed at any time after the call protection date. Call protection clauses usually require that an investor be paid a premium over the face value of the bond, which is subject to early retirement following the expiration of the call protection period specified in the clause."

            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. A bear market is commonly defined as a stock market decline of 20% or more over at least a two-month period. Bear markets are hard to anticipate, or manage. They start out looking like a routine market dip, then a correction, followed perhaps by bargain-hunting that is soon revealed to have been premature. By the time the bearish trend is inescapably obvious, stock prices are already down, forcing those who haven't pared risk from portfolios to wonder whether it still makes sense to do so, or whether that would just compound the cost of their unsuccessful attempts to time the market. Inaction by default is never the right answer, if only because bear markets tend to stick around for more than a couple of months. The 27 distinct declines of 20% or more in the S&P 500 index between 1929 and 2022 lasted 292 days on average, according to Ned Davis Research. As a result, investors likely have more time than they think to respond to the stock market's sagging fortunes, whether by adopting prudently defensive portfolio positioning or by speculating on continued declines. The first thing to do in a bear market is to make sure your portfolio is properly diversified between a variety of asset classes, not just stock market sectors. Diversification tamps down the volatility that tends to increase during bear markets and can subject investor portfolios to unnerving fluctuations. One study of returns during the Great Depression found that a portfolio with a 30% allocation to U.S. stocks, a 50% weighting in bonds, and 20% in cash would have provided deflation-adjusted annual returns averaging 7.3% between September 1929 and February 1937, which is in line with the average real return on equities between 1929 and 1998. The 30/50/20 portfolio even outperformed one 100% invested in bonds, underscoring the benefit of diversification. Bear market asset allocation generally involves dialing down the percentage of your portfolio invested in stocks and increasing exposure to government bonds or cash. The best time to switch equity for government bonds or cash is before the storm hits, meaning when valuations and interest rates soar and indexes hit new records. Timing is everything. After share prices start dropping hard, making big switches could backfire. Conservative portfolio shifts work best when in anticipation and not after a brutal sell-off, which is when equities may be undervalued. A lot also depends on your investment objectives. If you need the money soon, your portfolio should be more conservative anyway. Conversely, if you're young and saving for retirement, there's no need to change your asset allocation in anticipation of a bear market. A balanced\u00a0portfolio\u00a0is your best defense. It's also worth bearing in mind that within asset classes there are aggressive and more conservative options. For example, people associate stocks with lots of risk but there are certain categories of companies that are much less volatile. Among equities, defensive stock market sectors including consumer staples, utilities, and health care have outperformed during bear markets. The goods and services these sectors supply tend to be in demand regardless of economic or market conditions. They also generate plenty of cash, supporting relatively high dividend yields. These sectors are home to many large-cap companies with strong balance sheets, whose shares tend to hold up better during bear markets than small-cap or growth stocks. While riskier stocks are never more so than during a bear market, there is evidence they also haven't outperformed safer ones in the long run. That suggests a portfolio purge of the riskier stocks during a bear market may pay longer-term dividends as well. The average decline of the S&P 500 during a bear market. With stocks expected to decline further by definition in the middle of a bear market, why wouldn't an investor avoid them altogether? Bear markets often induce panic selling that can tempt anyone to liquidate stocks in favor of cash or short-term government bonds. The trouble is, few investors can expect to reliably time the market. Many investors who sell during a downturn will miss out on the sharp rallies that usually mark the bear market's end, significantly lowering their long-term returns. Once they miss the market turn, some are likely to continue digging in their heels, remaining underinvested for longer. While getting out of stocks will often seem like the prudent move during a bear market, it actually amounts to an incredibly risky bet on your own market timing abilities and against the stock market's long record of fully recovering its bear-market losses. Investors looking to minimize equities risk or to take advantage of tactical opportunities during a bear market can choose from a variety of instruments. They include long-term Treasury bonds likely to appreciate if the bear market is followed by a recession, as well as inverse ETFs, short positions on individual stocks, and put options for capitalizing on short-term declines in stock prices. Structured investment products including annuities can also offer downside protection while limiting your upside. All hedges have a price, whether it's expressed in the form of the option premium paid or, less obviously, the cap on an annuity policyholder's maximum return. Diversification and de-risking of an equity portfolio can provide comparable benefits at a lower cost. The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a short but violent bear market that bottomed on March 23, 2020 with the S&P 500 down nearly 34% in five weeks. The S&P 500 reclaimed its prior high by Aug. 18, 2020. Because every bear market in the past was ultimately followed by higher share prices, all of them with the benefit of hindsight presented chances to buy stocks on the cheap. Dollar-cost averaging capitalizes on such opportunities by investing in stocks in fixed, regular dollar increments, such as say, $500 every month. The strategy lets you buy more equity at lower prices and less at higher ones. An investor confident about a bear market's impending end could also buy the riskier stocks that tend to outperform in the early stages of the recovery. Of course, those are also the stocks likely to get savaged if the hoped-for bull market turns out to be another bear market rally. That depends on how soon you\u2019ll need the money you\u2019ve invested. Government bonds and defensive stocks historically perform better during a bear market. However, most people investing for the long term shouldn\u2019t be aggressively tweaking portfolios every time there is a sell-off. The best way to go is to build a well-diversified portfolio and stick by it.\u00a0Asset allocation tweaks should gradually occur over the years as you get closer to accessing your investment capital. As you get nearer that date, it's generally recommended to reduce your reliance on volatile securities. Lots of fund managers talk about moving to cash in bear markets. The problem is getting the timing right. Often people will start selling their stocks and parking the proceeds in savings accounts when the worst of the stock market decline is over and a bounce back is on the cards.\u00a0If you don\u2019t need the money you\u2019ve invested for a good few years and have faith in your long-term strategy, ride it out. And if that\u2019s not the case, make sure you deploy a more conservative, less volatile asset allocation mix before a bear market strikes. The best tip is not to panic and check how much your investments are losing every five minutes. If you built a good portfolio, have faith in it. The bad days won\u2019t last forever and your assets should hopefully bounce back and increase in value. A bear market is not for the faint-hearted, nor is it usually the right time to take outsized risks. And that's just as true for the risk of selling all your stocks as the risk of being fully invested in equities. Diversifying one's portfolio and prioritizing strong, well-capitalized balance sheets over hype when it comes to stock selection can pay off huge even if prompted by a bear market.

            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). The discount yield is a way of calculating a bond's return when it is sold at a discount to its face value, expressed as a percentage. Discount yield is commonly used to calculate the yield on municipal notes, commercial paper and treasury bills sold at a discount. Discount yield is calculated as and the formula uses a 30-day month and 360-day year to simplify the calculation. Image by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02021 Discount yield computes a discount bond investor's return on investment (ROI) if the bond is held until maturity. A Treasury bill is issued at a discount from par value (face amount), along with many forms of commercial paper and municipal notes, which are short-term debt instruments issued by municipalities. U.S. Treasury bills have a maximum maturity of six months (26 weeks), while Treasury notes and bonds have longer maturity dates. If a security is sold before the maturity date, the rate of return earned by the investor is different, and the new rate of return is based on the sale price of the security. If, for example, the $1,000 corporate bond purchased for $920 is sold for $1,100 five years after the purchase date, the investor has a gain on the sale. The investor must determine the amount of the bond discount that is posted to income before the sale and must compare that with the $1,100 sale price to calculate the gain. A\u00a0zero-coupon bond\u00a0is a another example of a discount bond. Depending on the length of time until maturity, zero-coupon bonds can be issued at substantial\u00a0discounts to par, sometimes 20% or more. Because a bond will always pay its full, face value, at maturity\u2014assuming no credit events occur\u2014zero-coupon bonds will steadily rise in price as the maturity date approaches. These bonds don't make periodic interest payments and will only make one payment of the face value to the holder at maturity. Assume, for example, that an investor purchases a $10,000 Treasury bill at a $300 discount from par value (a price of $9,700), and that the security matures in 120 days. In this case, the discount yield is ($300 discount)[/$10,000 par value] * 360/120 days to maturity, or a 9% dividend yield. Securities that are sold at a discount use the discount yield to calculate the investor's rate of return, and this method is different than bond accretion. Bonds that use bond accretion can be issued a par value, at a discount or a premium, and accretion is used to move the discount amount into bond income over the remaining life of the bond. Assume, for example, that an investor purchases a $1,000 corporate bond for $920, and the bond matures in 10 years. Since the investor receives $1,000 at maturity, the $80 discount is bond income to the owner, along with interest earned on the bond. Bond accretion means that the $80 discount is posted to bond income over the 10-year life, and an investor can use a straight-line method or the effective interest rate method. Straight-line posts the same dollar amount into bond income each year, and the effective interest rate method uses a more complex formula to calculate the bond income amount."

An embedded option is a feature of a financial instrument that lets issuers or holders take specified actions against the other party at some future time. Embedded options are provisions included in some fixed-income securities that allow investors or the issuer to do specific actions, such as call back (redeem) the issue early. Typically associated with bonds, an embedded option is a function that allows holders or issuers of financial securities to take specified action against one another in the future. Embedded options materially affect the value of a security. Embedded options differ from bare options, which trade separately from their underlying securities. In bare options, traders may buy and sell call and put options, which are essentially separate securities from the investments themselves. Contrarily, embedded options are inexorably linked to the underlying security. Consequently, they may not be bought or sold independently. Embedded options give investors the power to prematurely redeem a security. For example, a call provision is a type of embedded option that affords holders the power to redeem the bond before its scheduled maturity. Callable bonds\u00a0are a\u00a0tool used by issuers, especially at times of high prevailing interest rates, where such an agreement allows the issuer to buy back or redeem\u00a0bonds at some time in the future. In this case, the bondholder has essentially sold a\u00a0call option\u00a0to the company that issued the bond, whether they realize it or not. A putable provision is an embedded option on a bond that positions holders to demand early redemption from the issuer. In contrast to callable bonds (and also not as common as them),\u00a0putable bonds\u00a0provide more control of the outcome for the bondholder. Owners of putable bonds have essentially purchased a\u00a0put option\u00a0built into the bond.\u00a0Just like callable bonds, the bond indenture specifically details the circumstances a bondholder can utilize for the early redemption of the bond or put the bonds back to the issuer. Putable bond buyers make some concessions in price or yield (the embedded price of the put) to allow them to close out the bond agreements if rates rise, and then invest or loan their proceeds in higher-yielding agreements. Issuers of putable bonds need to prepare financially for the possible event when investors decide putting the bonds back to the issuer is beneficial. They do this by creating\u00a0segregated funds\u00a0set aside for just such an event or issuing\u00a0offsetting callable bonds\u00a0(like put/call strategies) where the corresponding transactions can essentially fund themselves. A convertible security is an investment that can be changed from its initial form into another form. The most common types of convertible securities are\u00a0convertible bonds\u00a0and\u00a0convertible preferred shares, which can be converted into common stock. With convertible bonds, an embedded option gives bondholders the right to exchange the bond for shares in the underlying common stock. Convertible securities usually have a lower\u00a0payout\u00a0than comparable securities without the conversion feature. Investors are willing to accept the lower payout due to the potential profit from sharing in the appreciation of a company's common stock through the conversion feature. The conversion value is similar to the value of the\u00a0call option\u00a0on the common stock. The conversion price, which is the preset price at which the security can be converted into common stock, is usually set at a price higher than the stock's current price. If the conversion price is closer to the market price, then it has a higher call value. The underlying security is valued based on its par value and coupon rate. The two values are added together for a more complete picture of the security's valuation. The valuation of bonds with embedded options is determined by using option pricing techniques. Depending on the type of option, the option price is either added to or subtracted from the price of the straight bond that has no options attached. After the value of the bond is determined, various yield values, such as yield to maturity (YTM) and the running yield, may then be calculated. Because embedded options may increase or decrease the value of a security, investors should be acutely aware of their presence. For example, a bond that has an embedded option gives the issuer the right to call the issue, potentially rendering the instrument less valuable to an investor than a non-callable bond. This is mainly due to the fact that the investor may lose out on interest payments they might otherwise enjoy if the callable bond were held to maturity. Embedded options on a bond are spelled out in a trust indenture, which delineates the terms and conditions that trustees, bond issuers, and bondholders must all observe. Banks that heavily invest their earning assets in products with embedded options at the generational low for yields on fixed-income assets are often vulnerable to rising interest rates. The option-adjusted spread (OAS) is the measurement of the spread of a fixed-income security rate and the\u00a0risk-free rate of return, which is then adjusted to take into account an\u00a0embedded option. Typically, one uses Treasury yields for the risk-free rate. The OAS spread is added to the fixed-income security price to make the risk-free bond price the same as the bond. The option-adjusted spread thus helps investors compare a fixed-income security\u2019s cash flows to reference rates while also valuing embedded options based on general market volatility. By separately analyzing the security into a bond and the embedded option, analysts can determine whether the investment is worthwhile at a given price. The OAS method is more accurate than simply comparing a bond\u2019s\u00a0yield to maturity\u00a0to a benchmark. Non-bond investments that feature embedded options include convertible preferred shares and mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). Convertible stocks give investors the option to convert their preferred shares into common stock with the issuing company. MBSs can have embedded prepayment options, which give mortgage holders the option to repay early. Embedded options expose investors to reinvestment risk as well as the propensity for limited price appreciation. Reinvestment risk manifests if an investor or issuer exercises the embedded option, where the recipient of the transactional proceeds is forbidden from reinvesting them. Furthermore, embedded options customarily limit a security's potential price appreciation, because when market circumstances change, the price of the affected security may be capped or bound by a specific conversion rate or call price."

Investopedia / Crea Taylor Rate level risk is the possibility that an interest-bearing asset will lose value if market interest rates increase above its coupon rate. Interest rate risk is one of the main factors affecting bond prices and typically increases with duration, a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates, stated in terms of years. When a government or business issues fixed-income securities, the price and coupon are set by the issuer to be competitive within the current rate environment. Bonds will be offered at prices based on term structure and corresponding rates across the current yield curve. As interest rates vary going forward, prices of existing bonds will fluctuate accordingly. When interest rates increase, bond prices fall, and when interest rates decrease, bond prices rise. When interest rates fall, holders of bonds and other fixed-income securities will typically see the value of their holding increase, even though the coupon rate is fixed. They may be able to sell their bond for a higher price than they paid for it. However, when rates increase, the value of a bond, or portfolio of bonds that have been issued at correspondingly lower rates, will decrease. When the market interest rate increase crosses the level of the fixed-income investment's coupon rate, the investor stands to lose value. This will be readily apparent in the daily pricing of bond mutual funds. For example, during a period when longer-term rates are rising, a bond portfolio that has a concentration in longer-term bonds will see its value drop. Investors who own individual bonds can hold their bonds to maturity (unless the bond has a call feature and is called) and receive the full return that the bond originally offered, barring a default. This assumes that the investor is comfortable with earning less than what may be available in the current market. For managers of large bond portfolios, rising rate levels have a significant effect on the value of the portfolio and the ability of the manager to attract and retain investors. For this reason, professional bond managers typically trade more frequently than individual bondholders in order to produce competitive pricing and yields for the portfolio.

            "title": "How the Face Value of a Bond Differs From Its Price",
            "content": "J.B. Maverick is an active trader, commodity futures broker, and stock market analyst 17+ years of experience, in addition to 10+ years of experience as a finance writer and book editor. Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Face value, also known as the par value, is equal to the dollar amount the issuer pays to the investor at maturity. The price of a bond can fluctuate in the market by changes in interest rates while the face value remains fixed. Some bonds, like zero-coupon bonds, are issued at a discount to par value so the price is lower than the par value at issue. The various terms surrounding bond prices and yields can be confusing to the average investor. A bond represents a loan made by investors to the entity issuing the bond, with the face value being the amount of principal the bond issuer borrows. The principal amount of the loan is paid back at some specified future date. Interest payments are made to the investor at regular, specified intervals during the term of the loan, typically every six months. A bond is fixed-rate security or investment vehicle. The interest rate to a bond investor or purchaser is a fixed, stated amount; however, the bond's yield, which is the interest amount relative to the bond's current market price, fluctuates with the price. As the bond's price varies, the price is described relative to the original par value, or face value; the bond is referred to as trading above par value or below par value. The need to change the yield to reflect current market conditions drives the price changes. Unfavorable developments demand higher yields, so bond prices must fall. In the same way, improvements in the company's situation allow it to raise funds at lower rates. Hence, the prices of existing bonds rise. Three factors that influence a bond's current price are the credit rating of the issuer, market interest rates, and the time to maturity. As the bond nears its maturity date, the bond price naturally tends to move closer to par value. The credit rating for a bond is determined by bond rating companies, such as Moody's or Standard & Poors. Lower ratings generally cause a bond's price to fall since it is not as attractive to buyers. When the price drops, that action tends to increase the bond's appeal because lower-priced bonds offer higher yields. Any change in public perception of a firm's creditworthiness can influence the price of its bonds. In many cases, bond rating downgrades simply confirm what investors already suspected. Prevailing market interest rates change after a bond is issued, and bond prices must adjust to compensate investors. If interest rates rise, then bond prices must fall. Suppose a three-year bond pays 3% when it is issued, and then market interest rates rise by half a percentage point a year later. To sell the bond in the secondary market, the price of the bond will have to fall about 1% (extra 0.5% per year x 2 years), so it will be trading at a discount to face value. New bonds issued from firms with similar credit quality are now paying 3.5%. The old 3% bond still pays 3% in interest, but investors can now look forward to an extra 1% when the bond matures. Similarly, the price of the bond must rise if interest rates fall. Time to maturity also usually influences bond prices; however, the exact effect depends on the shape of the yield curve. A normal yield curve features lower interest rates for short-term bonds and higher interest rates for long-term bonds. This situation is considered normal because longer-term bonds have higher interest rate risk. Investors will usually demand higher interest rates as compensation for taking that risk; however, the yield curve may flatten if there is widespread anticipation that interest rates will remain unchanged. If enough investors believe interest rates are going to fall, an inverted yield curve can occur. An investor might pay more than face value for a bond if the interest rate/yield they will receive on the bond is higher than the current rates offered in the bond market. In essence, the investor is paying more to receive higher returns. Yes, par value and face value are the same and both refer to the amount received by the investor at maturity, not the value at the time of its issue since bonds can be issued at a discount. Par value is most often used concerning bonds. Bonds are typically issued with par values of $1,000 or $100. Par Value and Bond price can be the same at issue, but it is not always the case. The price of a bond can change over time before it reaches maturity. When this happens, the price of a bond is not the same as the par value. The price of the bond is often then quoted at its par value. The most important difference between the face value of a bond and its price is that the face value is fixed, while the price varies due to outside influences. The amount set for face value remains the same until the bond reaches maturity. On the other hand, bond prices can change dramatically. Theoretically, a spectacular decline in credit quality can send the bond price to zero. In actual practice, secured bondholders are paid first when a business is liquidated, so some funds are usually recovered. Repeated interest rate hikes can also take a toll on bond prices. Finally, there is some good news on time to maturity. Bond prices normally approach the face value, or par value, as they approach maturity.

            "content": "jetcityimages / Getty Images A covered bond is a derivative instrument consisting of a package of loans that banks issue and sell to financial institutions for resale to investors. The individual loans that make up the package are collateralized against assets in case the issuer fails, which adds a layer of security for the holders of the covered bonds. Elements of the covered bond may include public sector loans and mortgage loans. Covered bonds are a more cost-effective way for lending institutions to expand their businesses than issuing unsecured debt instruments.\u00a0They are derivative investments, similar to mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities (ABS). A bank sells a number of investments that produce cash, typically mortgages or public sector loans, to a financial institution. That institution then assembles the investments into packages and issues them as bonds. The interest paid on the bonds is covered by the cash flowing from the loans. The institutions may replace defaulted or prepaid loans with performing loans to minimize the risk of the underlying assets. Covered bonds are common in Europe and are slowly gaining interest in the U.S. Covered bonds are rated by the major bond ratings agencies. The underlying loans of a covered bond stay on the balance sheet of the issuer. Therefore, even if the institution becomes insolvent, investors holding the bonds may still receive their scheduled interest payments from the underlying assets of the bonds, as well as the principal at the bond\u2019s maturity. Because of this extra layer of protection, covered bonds typically have AAA ratings. In 1988, the European Union (EU) created guidelines for covered bond transactions that allowed bond market investors to put more of their assets in them than was previously allowed. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has used them extensively to help Eastern European nations strengthen and modernize their capital markets. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced on July 28, 2008, that the Treasury and partner institutions planned to rev up the market for these securities in the U.S. Bank of America became the first bank to issue dollar-based covered bonds. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and other U.S. banks also began to issue covered bonds. Banks use covered bonds to free up cash for other financial activities, such as extending more mortgages to their customers. That activity stimulates the economy by encouraging consumers to become homeowners. Covered bonds may also free up funds for increasing the development of infrastructure, reducing the financial strain on local, state, and federal government agencies. Covered bonds are considered a safe investment. Purchased primarily by conservative investors and institutions, they offer an additional layer of protection, meaning that the interest payments and the principal of the bonds could remain intact even if the institution that owns the loans underlying the bonds goes bankrupt. Some sources suggest that covered bonds have been in existence since the reign of Friedrich the Great, who used covered bonds to finance the reconstruction of Prussia after the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). The modern covered bond market evolved rather more recently. They gained popularity in Europe in the 1990s, with their introduction in the U.S. dating to 2007. Bonds are secured by the assets of their issuers. In the event of a default, the bond owner has recourse against the issuer. In the case of investment-quality bonds, the default risk is slight. Covered bonds have two sources of recourse: the first against the issuer of the bond and the second against the assets of the bank that issued the loans that comprise the bond. Covered bonds exist in the usually-risky world of derivatives investments. However, they are among the least risky of investments. They offer the conservative investor a dual layer of protection from loss.

            "title": "Yield Maintenance: Definition, Formula, and How It Works",
            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. FlamingoImages / Getty Images Yield maintenance is a sort of prepayment penalty that allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments up until the maturity date. It dictates that borrowers pay the rate differential between the loan interest rate and the prevailing market interest rate on the prepaid capital for the period remaining to loan maturity. Yield maintenance premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment (the settlement of a debt or installment loan before its official due date). Furthermore, it makes refinancing unattractive and uneconomical to borrowers. When a borrower obtains financing, either by issuing bonds or by taking out a loan (e.g., mortgage, auto loan, business loan, etc.), the lender is periodically paid interest as compensation for the use of their money for a period of time. The interest that is expected constitutes a rate of return for the lender who projects earnings based on the rate. For example, an investor who purchases a 10-year bond with a $100,000\u00a0face value\u00a0and an annual\u00a0coupon rate\u00a0of 7%, intends to be credited annually by 7% x $100,000 = $7,000. Likewise, a bank that approves a $350,000 mortgage at a fixed interest rate expects to receive interest payments monthly until the borrower completes the mortgage payments years down the line. However, there are situations in which the borrower pays off the loan early or calls in a bond prior to the maturity date. This threat of a premature return of the principal is known as prepayment risk (in financial lingo, \"prepayment\" means the settlement of a debt or installment loan before its official due date). Every debt instrument carries it, and every lender faces it, to some degree. The risk is that the lender won't get the interest income stream for as long a period as they counted on. The most common reason for loan prepayment is a drop in interest rates, which provides an opportunity for a borrower or bond issuer to refinance its debt at a lower interest rate. To compensate lenders in the event that a borrower repays the loan earlier than scheduled, a prepayment fee or premium, known as yield maintenance, is charged. In effect, the yield maintenance allows the lender to earn its original yield without suffering any loss. Yield maintenance is most common in the commercial mortgage industry. For example, let's imagine a building owner who's taken out a loan to buy an adjacent property. It's a 30-year mortgage, but five years in, interest rates have fallen considerably, and the owner decides to refinance. He borrows money from another lender and pays off his old mortgage. If the bank that issued that mortgage imposed a yield maintenance fee or premium, it would be able to reinvest the money returned to them, plus the penalty amount, in safe Treasury securities and receive the same cash flow as they would if they had received all scheduled loan payments for the entire duration of the loan. The formula for calculating a yield maintenance premium is: YM\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nPV\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nof\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRP\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\non\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nthe\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMortgage\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n(\n\n\nIR\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nTY\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYM\n\n\n=\n\n\nYield\u00a0maintenance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPV\n\n\n=\n\n\nPresent\u00a0value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRP\n\n\n=\n\n\nRemaining\u00a0payments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIR\n\n\n=\n\n\nInterest\u00a0rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTY\n\n\n=\n\n\nTreasury\u00a0yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0Present\u00a0Value\u00a0factor\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0formula\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0calculated\u00a0as\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n(\n\n\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\nr\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\n=\n\n\nTreasury\u00a0yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n=\n\n\nNumber\u00a0of\u00a0months\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{aligned}&\\textbf{YM}=\\textbf{PV of RP on the Mortgage}\\times(\\textbf{IR}-\\textbf{TY})\\\\&\\textbf{where:}\\\\&\\text{YM}=\\text{Yield maintenance}\\\\&\\text{PV}=\\text{Present value}\\\\&\\text{RP}=\\text{Remaining payments}\\\\&\\text{IR}=\\text{Interest rate}\\\\&\\text{TY}=\\text{Treasury yield}\\\\&\\text{The Present Value factor in the formula can be calculated as }\\frac{1-(1+r)^{-\\frac{n}{12}}}{r}\\\\&\\textbf{where:}\\\\&r=\\text{Treasury yield}\\\\&n=\\text{Number of months}\\end{aligned}\n\n\n\u200bYM=PV\u00a0of\u00a0RP\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0Mortgage\u00d7(IR\u2212TY)where:YM=Yield\u00a0maintenancePV=Present\u00a0valueRP=Remaining\u00a0paymentsIR=Interest\u00a0rateTY=Treasury\u00a0yieldThe\u00a0Present\u00a0Value\u00a0factor\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0formula\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0calculated\u00a0as\u00a0r1\u2212(1+r)\u221212n\u200b\u200bwhere:r=Treasury\u00a0yieldn=Number\u00a0of\u00a0months\u200b For example, assume a borrower has a $60,000 balance remaining on a loan with 5% interest. The remaining term of the loan is exactly five years or 60 months. If the borrower decides to pay off the loan when the yield on 5-year Treasury notes drops to 3%, The yield maintenance can be calculated in this way. Step 1: PV = [(1 \u2013 (1.03)-60/12)/0.03] x $60,000 PV = 4.58 x $60,000 PV = $274,782.43 Step 2: Yield Maintenance = $274,782.43 x (0.05 \u2013 0.03) Yield Maintenance = $274,782.43 x (0.05 \u2013 0.03) Yield Maintenance = $5,495.65 The borrower will have to pay an additional $5,495.65 to prepay his debt. If Treasury yields go up from where they were when a loan was taken out, the lender can make a profit by accepting the early loan repayment amount and lending the money out at a higher rate or investing the money in higher-paying treasury bonds. In this case, there is no yield loss to the lender, but it will still charge a prepayment penalty on the principal balance."

Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master's in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology. He is a CFA charterholder as well as holding FINRA Series 7, 55 & 63 licenses. He currently researches and teaches economic sociology and the social studies of finance at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). A leveraged loan index (LLI) is a market-weighted index that tracks the performance of institutional leveraged loans. Several indexes for the market exist, but the most widely followed one is the S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index. A leveraged loan is a senior secured debt obligation that is rated below investment grade (i.e., part of the high-yield or \"junk\" bond market). Leveraged loans are issued to finance leveraged buyouts (LBOs), and most of the loans are traded in the secondary market. The leveraged loan index tracks the prices of the loans. A leveraged loan is structured, arranged, through a process known as\u00a0syndication. Loan syndication is the process of bringing together a group of lenders in funding various portions of a\u00a0loan\u00a0for a single borrower, often to diversify the credit risk exposure of any single lender. This version of a leveraged loan index is a common benchmark and represents the 100 largest and most liquid issues of the institutional loan universe. The most popular leveraged loan index (LLI) was developed by Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) and the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA). A sub-index assembled by S&P and LSTA is the U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 B/BB Rating Index, while S&P has a Global Leveraged Loan 100 Index on its own to include major issuers in Europe. The indexes are rebalanced twice per year. IHS Markit Ltd. and Credit Suisse also maintain proprietary leveraged loan indexes. An LLI serves as a benchmark for performance measurement of fund managers dedicated to leveraged loan investment strategies and as a basis for passive investment vehicles such as exchange traded funds (ETF). For example, the Invesco Senior Loan Portfolio (ticker: BKLN) is based on the S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index. According to Invesco, the asset management company that offers BKLN, the fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in the constituent securities that make up the leveraged loan index, which tracks the market-weighted performance of the component loans based on market weightings, spreads, and interest payments. If less than 100% of the assets are invested in the component securities of the index, there will be variability in the performance of the ETF versus the index. Some LLIs are tailored to derivatives products that utilize leveraged loans. For instance, the iTraxx LevX are a pair of two tradable indexes that hold credit default swaps (CDSs) representing a diversified basket of the 40 (formerly 35) most liquid European companies that have tradable debt offerings in the secondary market. The LevX indices track what are known as leveraged loan credit default swaps (LCDS). The iTraxx LevX Senior Index represents only\u00a0senior\u00a0loans, while the iTraxx LevX Subordinated Index represents\u00a0subordinated\u00a0debt including second- and third-lien loans.

He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. The issuance of green bonds\u2014tax-exempt bonds issued by federally qualified organizations and municipalities for the development of brownfield sites\u2014has surged in recent years along with\u00a0investor appetite for renewable energy. The SEB, a European financial services group, predicted the 2022 green bond market could reach $400 billion, but then growth unexpectedly slowed, mostly to increasing interest rates and inflation. But a mid-year report from Climate Bonds Initiative indicates the green bond market may not be struggling as suggested, down only 1% from the previous quarter. Green bond issuance rose to $236 billion globally in the first half of 2022, down modestly from a record $240 billion in the first half of 2021. While the industry represents a lot of potential for growth, it also faces significant long-term risks. One of the largest detractors when investing in\u00a0green bonds is a lack of liquidity. Being a small market, entering and exiting positions is not as easy as more popular investments. If yyou were looking for a liquid investment, then green bonds should be avoided, at least until the demand for new issuances is high and the market shows steady growth. Traditionally, they\u00a0would be strongly considered as an investment to hold until\u00a0maturity. However, in the current green bond investing climate, there are signs the market's liquidity is increasing, although investors should still proceed with caution. Another risk is the lack of a clear definition for a green bond\u2014investors might not know exactly where their money is going, meaning that it could potentially be used for the wrong reasons.\u00a0One of the reasons is the lack of a \"universally accepted legal\" definition for a green bonds. Another reason is green bonds do not have state how the funds will be used to promote \"green\" projects. Other risks for green bonds include: low yields,\u00a0mispricing, a lack of sufficient complex research available to make an educated investment decision, and the existence of some green bond issuers with questionable reputations. Another challenge is the demand for oil; as popular as alternative energy sources grow, there will need to be significant changes in costs and government policies to replace oil and petroleum products as the leading energy resource. Going green is a popular trend, and one that looks set to continue as long as interest grows and new investors are given environmentally-conscious investment options within their portfolios. Since 2020, governments around the world\u2014including the U.S.\u2014have enacted new regulations, which will, in turn, help many green projects. In 2022, U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, which is the \"first multi-decade piece of legislation targeting dramatic long-term reductions in greenhouse gases via several targeted incentive programs supporting low-carbon technologies.\" The new act is expected to increase renewable production while decreasing other \"high-carbon\" energy sources. Green bonds are gaining popularity in the U.S. For example, in May 2013, Tesla Motors, Inc. (TSLA) issued a $600 million convertible green bond. In March 2014, Toyota Motor Corp (TM) issued asset-backed security to finance hybrid vehicle loans. Green bond growth is evident in the U.S., but popularity began with power companies in France. This is more of a global story than a domestic one. Here are some\u00a0supranational issuers of green bonds: On top of that, the World Economic Forum suggests that $700 billion per year needs to be invested in clean energy, transportation, and forestry. The International Energy Agency recommends an investment of around $1 trillion per year toward a low carbon economy by 2035. Other corporate green bond issuances include: You can also invest in green bonds directly via Calvert Green Bond A (CGAFX). As of September 2022, CGAFX\u00a0hovers near its initial offering price and might be considered a buying opportunity as it bottoms out. Green bonds are without a doubt on the rise, and that trend is likely to continue. However, if you\u2019re the type of investor that seeks liquidity, then consider waiting until the market grows larger and more investment products\u00a0are available.

            "title": "Understanding and Investing in Sovereign Bonds",
            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. A sovereign bond is a debt security issued by a national government to raise money for its operations, pay down old debt, pay interest on current debt, and for any other government spending needs. Sovereign bonds may be denominated in a foreign currency or the government\u2019s domestic currency. Sovereign bonds are a major source of government financing, alongside tax revenue. They are a safe investment or a risky one depending on the financial health of the nation that issued them. Like any bond, sovereign debt entitles owners to periodic interest payments from the issuer\u2014in this case the government\u2014with repayment of the bond's face value when its term matures. As with other bonds, the interest rate paid, or yield, depends on the risk profile of the issuer. The yield will be higher for countries that are seen to be at a higher risk of default. Rating agencies grade sovereign bonds based on the economic profile of the country, its exchange rate, its outstanding debts, and its political stability to estimate the likelihood that it could default on its sovereign debt obligations. Rating agencies including Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch Ratings provide sovereign credit ratings for investors seeking to evaluate the risks involved in investing in a specific country. The same agencies provide credit ratings on corporations and the bonds they issue. Some developing countries can't attract foreign investment in bonds denominated in their domestic currency because foreign investors are unwilling to assume the additional risk of a fluctuating currency. Their currency markets may not be sufficiently liquid, or investors may be wary that the currency will lose value, eroding their rate of return. Countries borrowing in a foreign currency face similar currency exchange risk and higher borrowing costs if the domestic currency loses value against the one in which the sovereign bond is denominated. For example, say the Indonesian government issues bonds denominated in the Japanese yen to raise capital. It agrees to a nominal annual interest rate of 5%. During the bonds\u2019 term, the Indonesian rupiah depreciates by 10% annually versus the yen. As a result, the real interest rate on the yen-denominated debt to the Indonesian government will be 15% in rupiah terms. In August 2023, Fitch Ratings downgraded the long-term ratings of the United States to AA+ from AAA due to the anticipated fiscal deterioration over the next three years, an increasing government debt burden, and the erosion of governance in comparison to its peers over the previous two decades. The agency cited the repeated debt limit standoffs and their 11th-hour resolutions by Congress. Investing in U.S. sovereign bonds is a straightforward process and can be done on the U.S. Treasury Department site, TreasuryDirect.gov. Buying foreign bonds is a bit trickier and is usually done via a broker through an account set up for foreign trading. The broker would buy the bond at the prevailing market price. This route can be limiting, depending on what bonds are available, and the transaction costs can be high. A simpler alternative is to buy U.S. mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold foreign sovereign bonds. These funds also provide diversification with exposure to a variety of foreign bond issues, which reduces risk. Popular foreign sovereign bond ETFs include: Sovereign bond yields are the interest rate a government pays to buyers of its sovereign bonds. These are debt securities issued by a national government to raise capital. As with corporate bonds, sovereign bond yields are higher than average for risky issuers and lower than average for highly-rated issuers. Sovereign bonds, which are debt securities issued by national governments to raise money, can be denominated in either the local currency or in a global currency such as the U.S. dollar or the euro. As with any bond, the risk is judged by the likelihood that the issuer will default. Sovereign bonds are rated by the same agencies that rate corporate bonds to indicate their relative risk. Sovereign bonds issued by countries with low ratings are experiencing economic troubles, political instability, or both. That makes them more likely to default on their debts. Sovereign bonds issued by countries with high ratings are more stable and have a low risk of default. A sovereign bond may be issued by a national government to finance infrastructure programs, social programs, a war, or any other spending. As with corporate debt, the riskiness of sovereign debt depends on the likelihood of the underlying issuer defaulting. For countries with higher political and economic risk, the likelihood of default may be high. But for stable countries, the risk is low.
