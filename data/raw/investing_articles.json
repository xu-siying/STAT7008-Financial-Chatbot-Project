            "content": "A beginner\u2019s guide to asset classes James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. The investment landscape can be extremely dynamic and ever-evolving. But those who take the time to understand the basic principles and the different asset classes stand to gain significantly over the long haul. The first step is learning to distinguish different types of investments and what rung each occupies on the risk ladder. Investopedia / Joules Garcia Here are the major asset classes, in ascending order of risk, on the investment risk ladder. A cash bank deposit is the simplest, most easily understandable investment asset\u2014and the safest. It not only gives investors precise knowledge of the interest that they\u2019ll earn but also guarantees that they\u2019ll get their capital back. On the downside, the interest earned from cash socked away in a savings account seldom beats inflation. Certificates of deposit (CDs) are less liquid instruments, but they typically provide higher interest rates than those in savings accounts. However, the money put into a CD is locked up for a period of time (months to years), and there are potentially early withdrawal penalties involved. A bond is a debt instrument representing a loan made by an investor to a borrower. A typical bond will involve either a corporation or a government agency, where the borrower will issue a fixed interest rate to the lender in exchange for using their capital. Bonds are commonplace in organizations that use them to finance operations, purchases, or other projects. Bond rates are essentially determined by interest rates. Due to this, they are heavily traded during periods of quantitative easing or when the Federal Reserve\u2014or other central banks\u2014raise interest rates. A mutual fund is a type of investment where more than one investor pools their money together to purchase securities. Mutual funds are not necessarily passive, as they are managed by portfolio managers who allocate and distribute the pooled investment into stocks, bonds, and other securities. Most mutual funds have a minimum investment of between $500 and $5,000, and many do not have any minimum at all. Even a relatively small investment provides exposure to as many as 100 different stocks contained within a given fund's portfolio. Mutual funds are sometimes designed to mimic underlying indexes such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. There are also many mutual funds that are actively managed, meaning that they are updated by portfolio managers who carefully track and adjust their allocations within the fund. However, these funds generally have greater costs\u2014such as yearly management fees and front-end charges\u2014that can cut into an investor\u2019s returns. Mutual funds are valued at the end of the trading day, and all buy and sell transactions are likewise executed after the market closes. Many investment specialists advise their clients to diversity into a wide range of securities rather than focusing on just a few stocks. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become quite popular since their introduction back in the mid-1990s. ETFs are similar to mutual funds, but they trade throughout the day, on a stock exchange. In this way, they mirror the buy-and-sell behavior of stocks. This also means that their value can change drastically during the course of a trading day. ETFs can track an underlying index such as the S&P 500 or any other basket of stocks with which the ETF issuer wants to underline a specific ETF. This can include anything from emerging markets to commodities, individual business sectors such as biotechnology or agriculture, and more. Due to the ease of trading and broad coverage, ETFs are extremely popular with investors. Shares of stock let investors participate in a company\u2019s success via increases in the stock\u2019s price and through dividends. Shareholders have a claim on the company\u2019s assets in the event of liquidation (that is, the company going bankrupt) but do not own the assets. Holders of common stock enjoy voting rights at shareholders\u2019 meetings. Holders of preferred stock don\u2019t have voting rights but do receive preference over common shareholders in terms of the dividend payments. Some investments, such as hedge funds, are only permitted to wealthy investors. There is a vast universe of alternative investments, including the following sectors: Order your copy of Investopedia's What To Do With $10,000 magazine for more wealth-building advice. Many veteran investors diversify their portfolios using the asset classes listed above, with the mix reflecting their tolerance for risk. A good piece of advice to investors is to start with simple investments, then incrementally expand their portfolios. Specifically, mutual funds or ETFs are a good first step, before moving on to individual stocks, real estate, and other alternative investments. However, most people are too busy to worry about monitoring their portfolios daily. Therefore, sticking with index funds that mirror the market is a viable solution. Steven Goldberg, a principal at the firm Tweddell Goldberg Wealth Management and longtime mutual funds columnist at Kiplinger.com, further argues that most individuals only need three index funds: one covering the U.S. equity market, another focused on international equities, and the third tracking a broad bond index. More hands-on investors, however, may want to choose their own asset mix when crafting a diversified portfolio that fits their risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. This means that you can try to capture excess returns by tilting your portfolio weights to favor certain asset classes depending on the economic environment. Let's first consider the relative performance of stocks and bonds, which historically have shown somewhat of an inverse correlation: Most financial professionals recommend a portfolio mix consisting of stocks and bonds, as described above. Other asset classes, too, may favor certain economic conditions; however, not all asset classes are suitable for investors. Historically, the three main asset classes are considered to be equities (stocks), debt (bonds), and money market instruments. Today, many investors may consider real estate, commodities, futures, derivatives, or even cryptocurrencies to be separate asset classes. Generally, land and real estate are considered among the least liquid assets, because it can take a long time to buy or sell a property at market price. Money market instruments are the most liquid, because they can easily be sold for their full value. Real estate and commodities are considered to be good inflation hedges, because their value tends to rise as prices increase. In addition, some government bonds are also indexed to inflation, making them an attractive way to store excess cash. Investment education is essential\u2014as is avoiding investments that you don\u2019t fully understand. Rely on sound recommendations from experienced investors, while dismissing \u201chot tips\u201d from untrustworthy sources. When consulting professionals, look to independent financial advisors who get paid only for their time, instead of those who collect commissions. And above all, diversify your holdings across a wide swath of assets.

            "title": "What Are Stock Fundamentals?",
            "content": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning. Stock fundamentals are key metrics for a company, such as cash flow and return on assets (ROA). Analysts often perform fundamental analysis to analyze a stock by looking at its fundamentals. This involves looking at any data which is expected to impact the price or perceived value of a stock. In the broadest terms, fundamental analysis involves looking at any data which is expected to impact the price or perceived value of a stock. This is, of course, anything aside from the trading patterns of the stock itself, As the name implies, it means getting down to basics. Fundamental analysis focuses on creating a portrait of a company, identifying the fundamental value of its shares, and buying or selling the stock based on that information. Some of the indicators commonly used to assess company fundamentals include: Fundamental analysts have a staid approach to analyzing stock performance. They look at a variety of factors that they believe influence a stock's performance. These include the industry as a whole, the competition, a company's management structure, its income and revenue, as well as its growth potential. All of the data is public and readily available, generally through a company's financial statements. The goal is to ultimately identify which stocks are priced correctly\u2014and incorrectly\u2014by the market. To help you visualize it, let's use the following analogy. Think of the stock market as a shopping mall, where stocks are the items for sale in the retail outlets. Their sights are set solely on the products in the mall. Shoppers are dismissed as an unreliable, emotional herd with no inkling of the real value of the goods for sale. Fundamental analysts move slowly through the stores seeking the best deals. Once the crowd moves on from, say, the personal computers (PCs), they will take a closer look at the ones that were passed over. Fundamental analysts may take a stab at determining the scrap value of the PC stripped down to its hard disk, memory cards, monitor, and keyboard. In the stock market, this is akin to calculating the book value, or liquidation price, of a company. These analysts also take a very close look at the quality of the PC. Is it going to last or will it break down within a year? The fundamental analysts will pore over the specifications, scrutinize the manufacturer's warranty, and consult consumer reports. Similarly, equity analysts check a company's balance sheet for financial stability. Then, the fundamental analysts may try to understand the performance of the PC in terms of, say, processing power, memory, or image resolution. These are like the forecast earnings and dividends identified from a company's income statement. Finally, the fundamental analysts will put together all the data and come up with the intrinsic value, or value independent of the current sale price. If the sale price is less than the calculated intrinsic value, the fundamentalists will buy PCs. If not, they will either sell the PCs they already own or wait for prices to fall before buying more. Performing fundamental analysis can be a lot of hard work. But that is, arguably, the source of its appeal. By taking the trouble to dig into a company's financial statements and assessing its future prospects, investors can learn enough to know when the stock price is wrong. These conscientious investors are able to spot the market's mistakes and make themselves money. At the same time, buying companies based on intrinsic, long-term value protects investors from the dangers of day-to-day market fluctuations. However, the fact that fundamental analysis shows that a stock is undervalued does not guarantee it will trade at its intrinsic value any time soon. Things are not so simple. In reality, real share price behavior relentlessly calls into question almost every stock holding, and even the most independently-minded investor can start doubting the merits of fundamental analysis. There is no magic formula for figuring out intrinsic value. Just because fundamental analysis shows that a stock is undervalued doesn't guarantee it will trade at its intrinsic value in the near future. When the stock market is booming, it is easy for investors to fool themselves into thinking they have a knack for picking winners. But when the market falls and the outlook is uncertain, investors cannot rely on luck. They actually need to know what they're doing. Fundamental analysis is much different from its cousin, technical analysis. Where fundamental analysis focuses on measuring a stock's intrinsic value, technical analysis concentrates solely on the trading and price history of a stock by looking at trading signals and other analytical tools to evaluate the strength or weakness of a stock. Technical analysts believe that a stock's past performance\u2014its price and trading activity\u2014can help determine where it will go in the future. In essence, the theory of technical analysis is rooted in the fact that the movement in price is not random. Instead, it believes that patterns and trends are identifiable and repeat over time. To demonstrate, let's go back to the analogy above. Technical analysts ignore the goods for sale. Instead, they keep an eye on the crowds as a guide for what to buy. So, if a technical analyst notices shoppers congregating inside a computer shop, they will try to buy as many PCs as possible, betting that the growing demand will push PC prices higher.

            "content": "A 7-Step Guide to Jump-Start Your Investing Journey Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Investing in stocks can be a powerful way to grow your wealth over time. It involves buying shares in a company with the hope that the company will grow and perform well in the stock market over time, resulting in gains on your investment. It's important to start by setting clear investment goals, determining how much you can invest and how much risk you can tolerate. Then pick a broker that matches your trading style, fund your account, and buy stocks. This beginner\u2019s guide explains the essential steps to invest in stocks, whether you have thousands set aside or can invest a more modest $25 a week. Investing in stocks involves purchasing shares of ownership in a public company in the hopes of seeing the company perform well in the stock market, leading to a share price increase that makes your investment more valuable. Investing in stocks can lead to positive financial returns if you own a stock that grows in value over time. But you also face the risk of losing money if a share price falls over time. Begin by specifying your financial objectives. Clear goals will guide your investment decisions and help you stay focused. Consider both short-term and long-term goals, as they will affect your investment strategy. You might have short-term goals like saving for a home or a vacation or have long-term objectives like securing a comfortable retirement or funding a child\u2019s education. Your objectives depend on your life stage and ambitions. Younger investors tend to focus more on growth and long-term wealth accumulation, while those closer to retirement typically prefer generating income and capital preservation. The more precise you are, the better. The first step in any venture is the biggest, but by setting clear and precise investment goals, you'll lay a strong foundation for building your investments. This clarity will help you navigate the stock market with confidence and purpose. Pinpointing how much you can afford to put in stocks requires a clear-eyed assessment of your finances. This step helps ensure that you are investing responsibly without endangering your financial stability. Don't worry if your funds are less than you would wish. You wouldn't berate yourself for not being ready for a race on your first day of training; so, too, with investing. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and the journey is still ahead. Two crucial points: Taking these seriously is what separates investing from gambling. Understanding your risk tolerance is a cornerstone of investing. It helps you align your comfort level with the inherent uncertainties of the stock market and financial goals. By accurately determining your risk tolerance, you can build a portfolio that reflects your financial goals and personal comfort level, helping you navigate the stock market with more peace of mind. Whether you prefer a hands-on approach or a more passive strategy, understanding your investing style helps you choose the right investment methods and tools. Everyone has a different relationship with money. Some prefer an active role, meticulously pouring over every last cell on their portfolio's spreadsheets, while others opt for a set-it-and-forget-it approach. They trust their investments will grow over time if they just leave them alone. Your style might evolve, but you'll need to start somewhere, even if your choice isn't set in stone. Begin with a self-reflection on whether you enjoy researching and analyzing stocks or prefer a more detached approach. Here are your main choices: 1. DIY investing: If you grasp how stocks work and have the confidence to head out with minimal guidance into the market, managing the trades yourself is one option. Even DIY, there are more and less active approaches: 2. Professional guidance: For those who prefer a more personal approach and want more, an experienced broker or financial advisor is often invaluable. These financial professionals tailor their advice to your life experiences and goals, help you decide among the most promising stock choices, monitor your portfolio, and collaborate with you when things need changing. You've figured out your goals, the risk you can tolerate, and how active an investor you want to be. Now, it's time to choose the type of account you'll use. Each has its own features, benefits, and drawbacks. In addition, the type of account you choose can greatly impact your tax situation, investment options, and overall strategy. You'll need to compare different brokers to find the investment account right for you. 1. Understand the different account types: In the table below, we've listed the differences between regular brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, and managed accounts. You'll want to choose one that'll work for you. We also list special accounts for education and health savings. 2. Consider the tax implications: 3. Evaluate your investment goals: Match your investment account type with your goals. For long-term retirement savings, consider tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals or flexible investing, a standard brokerage account might be better. 4. Scrutinize account fees, commissions, and minimums: 5. Check for added features: Some accounts offer additional features such as automatic contributions, access to financial advisors, educational resources, and more. Select an account that provides the features that fit your preferences. 6. Pick your broker: Brokers\u00a0are full-service, discount, or robo-advisory. A good broker will offer the tools, resources, and support you need to make informed investment decisions and manage your portfolio effectively. By this step, you've picked a broker that aligns with your investment goals and preferences or is simply the most convenient. You've also decided whether you're opening a cash account, which requires you to pay for investments in full, or a margin account, which lets you borrow when purchasing securities. Once you've chosen a brokerage and account type, you'll open your account. This involves providing your personal information: Social Security number, address, employment details, and financial data. This shouldn't take you more than 15 minutes. Now you'll have to fund it. Here are tips for doing so: 1. Choose how you'll fund it: 2. Set up automatic contributions: Dollar-cost averaging involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals over time, no matter what the market does. This cuts your risk of making bad decisions based on short-term market news. Most brokers let you customize the frequency and amount of your automatic contributions, making it easier to stay within your budget and keep on track with your investment goals. 3. Start investing: Once you've verified the funds are in your account (don't worry: the brokerage won't let you trade otherwise), it's time to start choosing the stocks that best fit your investment goals. If you plan to trade frequently, check out our list of brokers for cost-conscious traders. Even experienced investors grapple with choosing the best stocks. Beginners should look for stability, a strong track record, and the potential for steady growth. Resist the temptation to gamble on risky stocks, hoping for a quick windfall.\u00a0Long-term investing is mostly slow and steady, not fast and rash. Here are the types of stocks more likely to be solid bets when starting off: It's prudent to begin with a conservative approach, focusing on stocks or funds that offer stability and a good track record. This will give you confidence and returns to trade with as you advance in your investing knowledge. Successful investors discover tips and strategies each passing day. As the stock market changes, staying up to date, going back to Step 1, reviewing your goals, etc., will be key. Here are tips on learning about, monitoring, and reviewing your accounts with an eye toward your goals and risk tolerance. You now need to monitor your stocks and other investments. Regular reviewing and staying informed will help you adjust when necessary to keep on track with your financial goals. Picking the right stocks can overwhelm those starting to navigate the investing world\u2014you're starting with a blank slate, and the options are endless. Here are ideas that aren't only the best for beginners but are many times the choice of the experts managing their own portfolios: Index funds: These are not technically stocks but funds that trade shares like them. They are passively managed funds that track the performance of a particular market index, like the S&P 500, a collection of 500 major publicly traded American companies. These might not come with the excitement of picking a stock and seeing it take off, but index funds take what would be impractical or too expensive for a beginner and let you invest in a whole pool of them. And they do well: According to the S&P Indices Versus Active score cards, a widely respected benchmark, about 90% of actively managed funds didn't match the returns of the S&P 500 over 10 and 15-year periods. This is simple but winning information: the most effortless route might be the most profitable. Blue chip stocks: Classic investing advice has been to buy shares of well-established, stable companies with a history of consistent growth and dividend payments. The blue chips\u2014named for the traditional color of the highest-value poker chips\u2014have strong brand recognition, a solid market position, and a track record of weathering economic downturns. Investing in them can provide you with stability and the potential for steady, long-term returns. Examples include Apple (AAPL), known for its ubiquitous technology products and loyal customer base; JP Morgan & Chase Co (JPM), the banking giant; Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), a healthcare giant that also owns manufacturers of many consumer goods; and Coca-Cola (KO), the soft drink maker that has distributed dividends each year since 1893. Dividend aristocrats: Coca-Cola is not just a blue-chip stock but also belongs to a select group that has distributed and increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. By investing in dividend aristocrats, beginners can benefit from the potential for rising income and the chance to reinvest the dividends for compound growth. Examples include ExxonMobil (XOM), one of the world's largest oil and gas companies with a history of solid cash generation; Procter & Gamble Co. (PG), the consumer products multinational; and Walmart (WMT), the retail behemoth. Low-volatility stocks: These companies' shares have historically had fewer price swings, providing more solidity to portfolios and, not for nothing, calm for investor heart rates. They often belong to \"defensive sectors\" (recession-proof parts of the economy) such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare. Examples include companies we've mentioned already (Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, etc.), as well as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), Brystol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY), Duke Energy (DUK), and the Hershey Company (HSY), whose stability even during financial storms shows that the love of chocolate doesn't go away when the economy hits some bumps. Quality factor ETFs: These invest in companies with solid balance sheets, consistent growth in earnings, and other measures of good financial health. Quality factor ETFs take a rules-based approach to selecting stocks with low debt levels, stable earnings, and high returns. Example funds include the iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF, which holds large- and midcap U.S. stocks with solid quality characteristics, and the Invesco S&P 500 Quality ETF, which focuses on high-quality stocks within the S&P 500 index. The potential drawback for each of these investments is that you might not see the outsized growth that riskier stocks could provide. In addition, past performance does not determine future results. If you have limited funds, this could be unappealing: more modest returns won't seem to add much when you don't have much to begin with. However, reinvested dividends and compound growth add up. Investing is not gambling, and the reason to invest rather than go to a casino is that prudent, patient, and disciplined investing is how most investors get ahead. The amount needed depends on the brokerage firm and the investments you're interested in. Some online brokerages have no minimum deposit requirements, allowing you to start investing with a small amount of money. However, the price of individual stocks and the minimum investment for certain mutual funds or ETFs might require you to start with more of an initial investment. That said, there are many brokerages and investment options now for those starting with less to invest than there were a decade or two ago. Stock funds, including mutual funds and ETFs that invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, are a good option for beginner investors. They offer diversification, which helps spread risk across different stocks, and are managed by professional fund managers. In addition, stock funds allow beginners to invest in a broad range of stocks with a single investment, making it easier to get started without having to pick individual stocks. While you watch your mutual fund or ETF investment over time, you will also gain experience about the ebb and flow of the stocks these funds hold, good knowledge that will help you when investing later. Investing is a commitment of resources now toward a future financial goal. There are many levels of risk, with certain asset classes and investment products inherently much riskier than others. It is always possible that the value of your investment will not increase over time. For this reason, a key consideration for investors is how to manage their risk to achieve their financial goals, whether short- or long-term. To open a brokerage account, you don't have to live in the U.S. Many U.S. brokerage firms accept international clients. However, the application process and requirements will differ, including the need for additional documentation, such as proof of identity and residence. There are also some investments and services regulations curtailed for those who aren't U.S. citizens, but the experience is very similar. Most major online brokerages in the U.S. accept international clients. Most brokers charge customers a commission for every trade. Due to commission costs, investors generally find it prudent to limit the total number of trades they make to avoid spending extra money on fees. Certain other types of investments, such as exchange-traded funds, may carry additional fees to cover fund management costs. Beginners can start investing in stocks with a relatively small amount of money. You'll have to do your homework to determine your investment goals, risk tolerance, and the costs of investing in stocks and mutual funds. You'll also need to research brokers and their fees to find the one that best fits your investment style and goals. Once you do, you\u2019ll be well-positioned to take advantage of the potential stocks have to reward you financially in the coming years.

            "content": "You work hard for your money. And you should be able to keep as much of it in your pocket as possible. But if you're thinking of investing your hard-earned cash to increase your net worth, there are some things you should keep in mind. Investing comes at a cost. There's certainly risk involved which can eat away at your profits. But something else that can chip away at your bottom line is the cost\u2014from fees to commissions. And it can all add up. So can you actually put your money away and keep your expenses low? The short answer is yes. Read on to find out more about how to keep these costs from depleting your profits. d3sign / Getty Images Most investments come with some type of fee. It's one of the only ways banks and other firms can make money. By charging you a fee, these institutions can keep running and offering you their services. Even the simplest investment vehicle can come with some form of service charge. Some savings accounts, for instance, charge a fee if you don't keep a minimum balance and you will incur a service charge if you make more than one withdrawal a month. It's your money, so why do you get hit with a fee? The account is, after all, meant for you to save your money. This principle\u2014of charging a fee\u2014is pretty consistent across the board. Businesses charge you money in order to keep and handle your accounts. But they also do the same when you want to move your money around. At times, you may feel like you're paying more than you're investing. Surely, there must be a way to keep that to a minimum, right? Of course there is. But before we outline how you can keep your money in your account by not paying outrageous fees, here's a quick look at some of the most common expenses that come with investing. A brokerage fee is charged by many different financial services companies including brokerage firms, real estate houses, and financial institutions. This fee is normally charged annually to maintain client accounts, pay for any research and/or subscriptions, or to access any investment platforms. These fees may also cover instances if and when an account goes dormant. Brokerage fees may be a certain percentage of the balance held in a client's account or a flat fee. Brokers and investment advisors often charge clients commissions for using their services. These are also called trading fees. They basically pay for any investment advice or to execute orders on the sale or purchase of securities including commodities, options, and bonds. Commission charges vary from firm to firm, so it's important to verify a brokerage's fee schedule before you decide to use their services. Management or advisory fees are charged by companies that run investment funds. Fund managers are compensated with these fees for their expertise. Although they can vary between funds, most of these fees are based on a percentage of the assets under management (AUM) in each fund. There is no universal system regarding trading commissions or other fees charged by brokerage firms and other investment houses. Some charge rather steep fees for each trade, while others charge very little, depending on the level of service they provide. Discount brokerages no longer charge for trading stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds. This change has become a huge saver for investors. If you plan on trading other securities, such as futures, options, and bonds, you will be charged and the amount varies by broker. The cost is usually per contract or per bond, for example. ETFs come with expense ratios; the fee that is charged for administering the fund. You'll want to choose ETFs with low expense ratios if you want to keep costs down. So, if your broker charges $1.50 per futures contract, the more futures contracts you trade, the more you'll be charged. You'll want to ensure that the returns you're getting at least outweigh your costs. For example, if you trade 10 futures contracts, you'll be charged $15. If you earned $5 on your investment, you actually have a loss of $10 ($15-$5). You'll need to earn at least $15 on your trade to break even. Some brokerage firms may give commission discounts to investors who make many trades. For example, a brokerage firm may charge $10 per trade for its regular customers, but may only charge $5 per trade for customers who make 50 trades or more per month. In other cases, investors and brokers may agree to a fixed annual percentage fee. Because you pay the same annual percentage fee, it doesn't really matter how often you trade. Even though fees are an integral part of the financial system, you don't have to be beholden to them. There is a way that you can keep your expenses down and continue investing. Consider investing your money with a firm that charges no commissions or fees for stock and ETF trades. Some of these firms also waive the minimum deposit requirement, so you can start with a low balance at no additional cost. You will, however, want to check on their fee structure for other investment vehicles along with any other fees they may charge to see if it balances out. Automated investment platforms may also help cut down on your expenses. Robo-advisors are a relatively new trend in the financial industry and can be great for small investors because they have low fees. This means more money in your pocket. They can afford to do this because they're automated, so they don't have anyone physically managing client accounts. Instead, robo-advisors use algorithms to maintain and reallocate your holdings according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Dave Rowan, CFP\u00aeRowan Financial LLC, Bethlehem, PA Minimizing commissions and fees can have a huge impact on your investing career. Here are three ways to do so: If you do decide to invest in a fund with a trading fee, try to invest more than $1,000 per fund. Today, there are many options to invest without paying fees. Many brokerage firms, such as E*Trade and Charles Schwab, don't charge investors for trading stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds. You can simply create an account with these brokerages, deposit money, and start trading these securities without incurring fees. Note that they do charge fees for other securities, such as futures, options, and bonds. There are some legal methods to avoid having to pay taxes on investments. For example, Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax money and when you are legally allowed to withdraw, you will not pay taxes on the contributions or the earnings. You can also use capital losses to offset ordinary income to reduce your taxes. Commissions are charges made by an investment professional for buying or selling securities for you. They are to compensate the professional for their work. Commissions are usually a set percentage of the value of the investments traded. Trading commissions and fees eat into your investment returns; as such, you want to keep them as low as possible. If you'll primarily be buying and selling stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds, you're in the clear, as most brokerages now don't charge for this type of trading activity. If you plan on trading securities that have fees, such as futures and bonds, then you'll want to strategize on how best to keep these costs as low as possible.

            "title": "4 Basic Things to Know About Bonds",
            "content": "Want to strengthen your portfolio\u2019s risk-return profile? Adding bonds can create a more balanced portfolio by adding diversification\u00a0and calming volatility. But the bond market may seem unfamiliar even to the most experienced investors. Many investors make only passing ventures into bonds because they are confused by the apparent complexity of the bond market and the terminology. In reality, bonds are very simple debt instruments. So how do you get into this part of the market? How do bonds work? Get your start in bond investing by learning these basic bond market terms. A bond is simply a loan taken out by a company. Instead of going to a bank, the company gets the money from investors who buy its bonds. In exchange for the capital, the company pays an interest coupon, which is the annual interest rate paid on a bond expressed as a percentage of the face value. The company pays the interest at predetermined intervals (usually annually or semiannually) and returns the principal on the maturity date, ending the loan. Unlike stocks, bonds can vary significantly based on the terms of their indenture, a legal document outlining the characteristics of the bond. Because each bond issue is different, it is important to understand the precise terms before investing. In particular, there are six important features to look for when considering a bond. Bonds are a form of IOU between the\u00a0lender\u00a0and the borrower. Corporate bonds refer to the debt securities that companies issue to pay their expenses and raise capital. The yield of these bonds depends on the creditworthiness of the company that issues them. The riskiest bonds are known as \u201cjunk bonds,\u201d but they also offer the highest returns. Interest from corporate bonds is subject to both federal and local income taxes. Sovereign bonds, or sovereign debt, are debt securities issued by national governments to defray their expenses. Because the issuing governments are very unlikely to default, these bonds typically have a very high credit rating and a relatively low yield. In the United States, bonds issued by the federal government are called Treasuries, while those issued by the United Kingdom are called gilts. Treasuries are exempt from state and local tax, although they are still subject to federal income tax. Municipal bonds, or munis, are bonds issued by local governments. Contrary to what the name suggests, this can refer to state and county debt, not just municipal debt. Municipal bond income is not subject to most taxes, making them an attractive investment for investors in higher tax brackets. Read about Investopedia\u2019s 10 Rules of Investing by picking up a copy of our special-issue print edition. This is the date when the principal or par amount of the bond is paid to investors and the company\u2019s bond obligation ends. Therefore, it defines the lifetime of the bond. A bond\u2019s maturity is one of the primary considerations that an investor weighs against their investment goals and horizon. Maturity is often classified in three ways: A bond can be secured or unsecured. A secured bond pledges specific assets to bondholders if the company cannot repay the obligation. This asset is also called collateral on the loan. If the bond issuer defaults, the asset is then transferred to the investor. A mortgage-backed security (MBS) is one type of secured bond backed by titles to the homes of the borrowers. Unsecured bonds, on the other hand, are not backed by any collateral. This means that the interest and principal are only guaranteed by the issuing company. Also called debentures, these bonds return little of your investment if the company fails. As such, they are much riskier than secured bonds. When a firm goes bankrupt, it repays investors in a particular order as it liquidates. After a firm sells off all its assets, it begins to pay out its investors. Senior debt is debt that must be paid first, followed by junior (subordinated) debt. Stockholders get whatever is left. The coupon amount represents interest paid to bondholders, normally annually or semiannually. The coupon is also called the coupon rate or nominal yield. To calculate the coupon rate, divide the annual payments by the face value of the bond. While the majority of corporate bonds are taxable investments, some government and municipal bonds are tax-exempt, so income and capital gains are not subject to taxation. Tax-exempt bonds normally have lower interest than equivalent taxable bonds. An investor must calculate the tax-equivalent yield to compare the return with that of taxable instruments. Some bonds can be paid off by an issuer before maturity. If a bond has a call provision, it may be paid off at earlier dates, at the option of the company, usually at a slight premium to par. A company may choose to call its bonds if interest rates allow them to borrow at a better rate. Callable bonds also appeal to investors, as they offer better coupon rates. Bonds are a great way to earn income because they tend to be relatively safe investments. But, just like any other investment, they do come with certain risks. Here are some of the most common risks with these investments. Interest rates share an inverse relationship with bonds, so when rates rise, bonds tend to fall, and vice versa. Interest rate risk comes when rates change significantly from what the investor expected. If interest rates decline significantly, the investor faces the possibility of prepayment. If interest rates rise, the investor will be stuck with an instrument yielding below market rates. The greater the time to maturity, the greater the interest rate risk an investor bears, because it is harder to predict market developments further into the future. Credit or default risk\u00a0is the risk that interest and principal payments due on the obligation will not be made as required.\u00a0When an investor buys a bond, they expect that the issuer will make good on the interest and principal payments\u2014just like any other creditor. When an investor looks into corporate bonds, they should weigh out the possibility that the company may default on the debt. Safety usually means the company has greater operating income and cash flow compared to its debt. If the inverse is true and the debt outweighs available cash, the investor may want to stay away. Prepayment risk is the risk that a given bond issue will be paid off earlier than expected, normally through a call provision.\u00a0This can be bad news for investors because the company only has an incentive to repay the obligation early when interest rates have declined substantially. Instead of continuing to hold a high-interest investment, investors are left to reinvest funds in a lower-interest-rate environment. Most bonds come with a rating that outlines their quality of credit\u2014that is, how strong the bond is and its ability to pay its principal and interest. Ratings are published and used by investors and professionals to judge their worthiness. The most commonly cited bond rating agencies are Standard & Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings. They rate a company\u2019s ability to repay its obligations. Each rating agency has a different scale. For S&P, investment grade ranges from AAA to BBB. These are the safest bonds with the lowest risk. This means they are unlikely to default and tend to remain stable investments. Bonds rated BB\u00a0or below are speculative bonds, also known as junk bonds\u2014default is more likely, and they are more speculative and subject to price volatility. Firms will not have their bonds rated, in which case it is solely up to the investor to judge a firm\u2019s repayment ability. Because the rating systems differ for each agency and change from time to time, research the rating definition for the bond issue you are considering. Bond yields are all measures of return. Yield to maturity is the measurement most often used, but it is important to understand several other yield measurements that are used in certain situations. As noted above, yield to maturity (YTM) is the most commonly cited yield measurement. It measures what the return on a bond is if it is held to maturity and all coupons are reinvested at the YTM rate. Because it is unlikely that coupons will be reinvested at the same rate, an investor\u2019s actual return will differ slightly. Calculating YTM by hand is a lengthy procedure, so it is best to use Excel\u2019s RATE or YIELDMAT functions (starting with Excel 2007). A simple function is also available on a financial calculator. The current yield can be used to compare the interest income provided by a bond to the dividend income provided by a stock. This is calculated by dividing the bond\u2019s annual coupon by the bond\u2019s current price. Keep in mind, this yield incorporates only the income portion of the return, ignoring possible capital gains or losses. As such, this yield is most useful for investors concerned with current income only. The nominal yield on a bond is simply the percentage of interest to be paid on the bond periodically. It is calculated by dividing the annual coupon payment by the par or face value of the bond. It is important to note that the nominal yield does not estimate return accurately unless the current bond price is the same as its par value. Therefore, nominal yield is used only for calculating other measures of return. A callable bond always bears some probability of being called before the maturity date. Investors will realize a slightly higher yield if the called bonds are paid off at a premium. An investor in such a bond may wish to know what yield will be realized if the bond is called at a particular call date, to determine whether the prepayment risk is worthwhile. It is easiest to calculate the yield to call using Excel\u2019s YIELD or IRR functions, or with a financial calculator. The realized yield of a bond should be calculated if an investor plans to hold a bond only for a certain period of time, rather than to maturity. In this case, the investor will sell the bond, and this projected future bond price must be estimated for the calculation. Because future prices are hard to predict, this yield measurement is only an estimation of return. This yield calculation is best performed using Excel\u2019s YIELD or IRR functions, or by using a financial calculator. There are two ways that bondholders receive payment for their investment. Coupon payments are the periodic interest payments over the lifetime of a bond before the bond can be redeemed for par value at maturity. Some bonds are structured differently. Zero-coupon bonds are bonds with no coupon\u2014the only payment is the face-value redemption at maturity. Zeros are usually sold at a discount from face value, so the difference between the purchase price and the par value can be computed as interest. Convertible bonds are a type of hybrid security that combines the properties of bonds and stocks. These are ordinary, fixed-income bonds, but they can also be converted into stock of the issuing company. This adds an extra opportunity for profit if the issuing company shows large gains in its share price. The bond market is actually much larger than the stock market, in terms of aggregate market value. Bond prices are inversely related to interest rate moves. So if interest rates go up, bond prices fall, and vice versa. Bonds have historically been more conservative and less volatile than stocks, but there are still risks. For instance, there is a credit risk that the bond issuer will default. There is also interest rate risk, where bond prices can fall if interest rates increase. Although the bond market appears complex, it is really driven by the same risk-return tradeoffs as the stock market. Once an investor masters these few basic terms and measurements to unmask the familiar market dynamics, they can become a competent bond investor. Once you have a hang of the lingo, the rest is easy.

            "title": "How To Invest Like Snoop Dogg",
            "content": "While We Can't All Be Hip Hop Legends, We Can Follow His Key Strategies for Investment Success Stephen J. Cohen / Getty Images Long before many tech investors caught on to companies like Reddit, Inc. (RDDT) and Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), Snoop Dogg (born Calvin\u00a0Cordozar\u00a0Broadus\u00a0Jr.) was already buying up shares as part of a diversified portfolio that would be the envy of any venture capitalist. The hip-hop legend, whose net worth is estimated at $160 million, has transformed himself from a musician into a shrewd business mogul by following a clear investment philosophy: get in early, demand equity, and capture gains from emerging trends. While known for his laid-back persona, Snoop's approach to investing is anything but casual. \"I want some equity. Give me a piece of the pie,\" he told the New York Times, explaining his strategy of seeking ownership rather than just brand ambassador roles. This mindset has led him to successful early-stage investments in tech unicorns, the creation of Casa Verde Capital (a $300 million cannabis-focused venture fund), and the strategic acquisition of Death Row Records\u2014the very label that launched his career. While many celebrities diversify into business ventures, Snoop Dogg has built a particularly impressive investment portfolio spanning technology, cannabis, media, and consumer goods. Here's a breakdown of his most significant investments: Technology Ventures Snoop's early-stage tech investments have yielded some of his biggest returns. In 2014, he joined a $50 million funding round for Reddit, which went public in 2024 and now has a market capitalization of about $20 billion. That same year, he took part in Robinhood's $13 million seed round\u2014the trading platform is now valued at over $20 billion. He's also a minority shareholder in Klarna, the pre-initial public offering digital payment platform valued at about $15 billion as of November 2024. Cannabis Through Casa Verde Capital, the investment firm he cofounded in 2015, Snoop helped seed institutional investments in cannabis companies before many traditional venture capital firms were willing to enter the space. Snoop's focus on cannabis showed his ability to spot mainstream prospects in what others considered fringe markets. \"I helped make this business famous before it became legal,\" he told the New York Times, noting the irony that he still has marijuana-related offenses on his criminal record while the industry has become a multibillion-dollar legal enterprise. The company's portfolio has grown to be worth about $300 million, with investments that include the following: Media and Entertainment Assets In 2022, Snoop acquired the Death Row Records brand from Blackstone Inc. (BX)-controlled MNRK Music Group. While specific terms weren't disclosed, industry experts estimate the deal's value at about $50 million. The acquisition included the brand and the ability to release music under the iconic label. Consumer Brands and Partnerships Snoop has strategically built ownership positions in several consumer brands: Snoop Dogg is still creating music, of course. His new album, dropping Dec. 13, 2024, is \u201cMissionary\u201d\u2014the first produced entirely by\u00a0Dr. Dre since Snoop\u2019s 1993 multiplatinum, genre-defining debut, \u201cDoggystyle.\u201d Snoop Dogg's evolution from Death Row Records artist to sophisticated investor reflects a deliberate strategy that has done far more than take him from \"sippin' on gin and juice\" to co-owning a gin company. His investment approach can be broken down into several core principles that have guided his success. Snoop's early investments in Reddit and Robinhood weren't just lucky guesses\u2014they represented calculated bets on platforms that were solving real problems. His tech investments typically focus on companies making services more accessible to everyday users, whether it's social media, stock trading, or payment processing through Klarna. Snoop isn't just working with Dr. Dre musically\u2014they recently launched Still G.I.N., a premium gin brand. The venture's name plays off their 1999 hit \"Still D.R.E.\" and represents their latest business collaboration after decades of musical partnership. Snoop has said that he's been careful to demand equity over fees. This reflects an understanding that real wealth creation comes from ownership\u2014not one-off payments. This principle guided his transition from brand endorsements to becoming a stakeholder in companies like Klarna and eventually acquiring the brand of Death Row Records. While many might see Snoop's success as solo moves, especially given how many of his investments reflect his interests, he credits his approach to learning from others. \"I got a lot of relationships. Quincy Jones and Charlie Wilson are like uncles to me, where they shape and mold the lifestyle of Snoop Dogg, not just the business,\" he has said. \"What you learn about being a better person from somebody is more important than what you learn business-wise or career-wise.\" This holistic approach to business relationships has shaped his entire career\u2014from Master P teaching him early on how to build a brand to Martha Stewart opening doors in mainstream business circles, leading to deals like his successful Skechers partnership. \"My branding and my business came when I was able to go to No Limit Records with Master P,\" Snoop has said. \"He taught me how to be a better businessman, how to be more than just a rapper, but to be about my business. It's called show business. I had mastered 'show.' But Master P showed me how to master the business.\" Snoop's reasons for demanding ownership interest in negotiations are about equity in both meanings of the term. \"We should be able to have some of our people\u2014that look like me\u2014as executives, as CEOs, as platform owners. You know, the top of the chain, not just the spokesperson or the brand ambassador. We need to be the brand owners,\" he told the New York Times. Snoop's most successful ventures align with his expertise and authentic interests. Casa Verde Capital's focus on cannabis leverages his deep understanding of that market. Similarly, his acquisition of Death Row Records wasn't just nostalgia\u2014it was an investment in an industry he knows intimately. Much like his early music albums, many of Snoop's investments succeed because he spots cultural shifts early. His cannabis investments preceded widespread legalization, and his tech investments targeted platforms that would become central to digital culture. This demonstrates the value of understanding broader social trends when making investment decisions. While Snoop maintains significant investments in entertainment and cannabis, his portfolio spans multiple sectors, including technology, beverages, and consumer goods. However, this diversification isn't random\u2014each investment typically leverages his brand, expertise, or network in some way. From his business relationship with Martha Stewart to his recent gin venture with Dr. Dre, Snoop's success often involves strategic partnerships. These collaborations extend his reach into new markets while sharing expertise and risk. Snoop's most crucial investment skill might be his willingness to walk away from bad deals and jump on promising ones. When offered brand ambassador roles without equity, he passes. Rather than accept traditional royalty deals in cannabis, he built his own venture fund. When he saw Death Row Records' potential value, he dropped money on acquiring the whole brand rather than just licensing his old music. This \"drop it or drop in\" strategy has helped him build a portfolio worth watching\u2014and strategies worth copying. Snoop Dogg has managed to keep himself relevant through vast shifts in the cultural firmament. In 2024, he gained widespread attention during the Olympics for his patriotic and sly commentary alongside comedian Kevin Hart. The duo\u2019s playful, down-to-earth takes on various Olympic events resonated with audiences, making their coverage a viral hit across social media. What's next for Snoop Dogg in investing? He's told interviewers that he's looking to build \"a brand strong enough to compete with Levi\u2019s and Miller and Kraft and all of these other brands that have been around for hundreds of years.\u201d His brand has become an extension of his entrepreneurial identity, blending authenticity with ambition. His \"I creep and I crawl\" approach, first announced in his hit single \u201cWho Am I? (What\u2019s My Name?),\u201d and long-term focus on brand ownership are what makes each investment a \u201cnext episode\u201d in Snoop\u2019s ever-evolving career\u2014one that's centered on a sustainable and growing wealth portfolio. Snoop Dogg\u2019s investments span tech, cannabis, consumer goods, and entertainment, demonstrating a keen sense of market trends and an eye for emerging opportunities. More than just a celebrity investor, Snoop has curated a strategy that relies on leveraging his expertise and network to add real value. His early stakes in companies like Reddit and Robinhood illustrate his foresight, while Casa Verde Capital positions him as a pioneer in the legal cannabis market. From tech unicorns to legacy acquisitions like Death Row Records, Snoop\u2019s success underscores the effectiveness of combining a personal brand with business acumen to build a lasting, impactful portfolio.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Adam Hayes, Ph.D., CFA, is a financial writer with 15+ years Wall Street experience as a derivatives trader. Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance.

The launch of the iPhone 16 series in September 2024 once again put Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the spotlight. However, the stock had a muted reaction following slower-than-expected sales of the updated release. This raises an important question for AAPL investors: Does the stock go up when iPhones are released? In this article, we'll explore the relationship between iPhone releases and Apple's stock performance. Historically, Apple's stock has exhibited mixed reactions to iPhone launch events. In the lead up to a new upgrade, the stock may rise, but on the day of the announcement, the stock often underperforms the market or experiences a slight decline. This phenomenon can be attributed to the \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" effect, which reflects the market's tendency to price in expectations before major announcements (even positive ones). However, after the initial dip, product releases serve as catalysts for subsequent stock increases. This pattern suggests that while short-term traders might see volatility around launch dates, long-term holders often benefit from sustained growth following successful product updates or introductions. Investors should pay close attention to the days before and after a new product launch to gauge its demand. Positive reception and strong initial sales figures can drive the stock upward, while disappointment or production issues can lead to declines. Apple iPhone sales account for half of all revenues for the company. As the AAPL price chart above illustrates (using a logarithmic price scale), Apple's stock fluctuated around iPhone launch periods. While not every launch correlates with immediate stock growth, the trajectory has been positive, reflecting the company's continued market dominance. In fact, after some releases, the stock remained flat or declined for several months before continuing its broader bullish trend. This is because, while important to the company, the iPhone is just one part of Apple's overall portfolio. While new iPhone features grab headlines, investors are increasingly focused on Apple's services growth and its potential in emerging technologies like AI. Various products and services beyond the iPhone contribute to Apple's revenue and stock performance. These include the Mac lineup, iPads, Apple Watch, AirPods, and services like the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple TV+ streaming service. The company's ecosystem creates multiple revenue streams, reducing reliance on any single product. Apple has also been attempting to derive a more significant proportion of its revenues from services since these are less reliant on the physical products that can be snarled by changing economic conditions, technological shifts, as well as inflationary, supply chain, and other pressures. In 2023, Apple services accounted for more than a fifth, 22%, of all revenues. This has helped keep Apple's stock price moving up over the years. The chart below shows its stock price and the change in the value of a $10k investment in Apple over 30 years. While iPhone and other product launches are significant events for Apple, here are other factors that influence the company's stock performance: The top holders of AAPL stock are institutional owners, which include the Vanguard Group, BlackRock Finance Inc. (BLK), State Street Corporation (STT), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A). As of the fourth quarter of 2024, 32 out of 38 analysts covering the stock have a \"buy\" or \"strong buy\" recommendation on AAPL stock, with an average near-term price target of around 5% to 7% higher than the present share price. Apple usually releases its newest iPhone series in the Fall (September or October) of each consecutive year. The iPhone 16 was released in September 2024, so the iPhone 17 should be released in the Fall of 2025. For the most accurate information, keep an eye on official announcements from Apple. Apple's annual iPhone release, typically in September, often creates a buzz in the stock market. Investors closely watch these events, as the iPhone remains Apple's flagship product and a significant revenue driver. However, the stock's performance during this period isn't always predictable. While positive reception to new iPhone features can boost share prices, the stock sometimes experiences a \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" effect, where prices rise in anticipation but dip after the announcement. Several factors influence Apple's stock around iPhone launches. These include pre-order numbers, analyst projections, and broader market conditions. Supply chain issues or production delays can also impact investor sentiment. Apple's stock performance is increasingly tied to its growing services segment and other product lines, not just iPhone sales. Potential investors should consider Apple's overall financial health, competitive position, and long-term strategy rather than focusing solely on iPhone launch events. Michael M.

Christopher Furlong / Getty Images For many centuries, gold has been a popular investment because it's a store of value and helps protect against rising prices. Many investors put part of their portfolios in gold, seeing it as a way to diversify and safeguard their wealth during periods of economic uncertainty. But just how much could you make investing in gold over the long term? Let's say you had an extra $200 to invest. While returns vary based on market conditions and growth rates, a $200 investment in gold in 2000, for example, would have been worth over $800 by 2020 and nearly $1,900 by 2024. Of course, like any investment, putting your money into gold involves risks. Its price can be volatile, and it doesn't provide any interest or dividends\u2014you don't make money just by holding onto it. Owning physical gold also comes with security and storage needs. Still, gold has hit records recently, and with future uncertainty about the economy and geopolitics, it may continue even higher. Read on to learn more about how to invest in gold and what that entails. Over the past 50 years, gold prices have changed significantly, influenced by many economic and political events. In 1972, when the U.S. dollar became a free-floating fiat currency, gold traded under $100 per ounce (about $479 when adjusted for inflation). Over the next decade, gold embarked on a historic stretch of ever-rising prices, reaching a then-record high of around $840 in 1980 (just over $3,000 inflation-adjusted) amid double-digit inflation in the U.S. and political tensions like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and oil embargoes. The chart below provides the average annual prices of gold since the U.S. went off the gold standard in 1971, both with the nominal prices and as adjusted to 2024 prices (you can follow the lines for specific prices in given years): After the record highs in 1980, gold prices retreated in the 1980s and 1990s as inflation cooled and the stock market boomed. The precious metal traded between $300 and $500 per ounce for nearly 20 years before sinking to near-term lows by 2000. However, gold regained its luster in the 2000s, almost doubling from $500 in 2005 ($825 in today's dollars) to over $1,000 by 2008 ($1,495 in today's dollars). The 2008 financial crisis was a significant turning point for gold prices. As the U.S. housing bubble burst and the stock market crashed, investors bought gold as a safe haven asset. Its price surged to an all-time high near $1,900 in 2011 ($2,740 in today's dollars) as the U.S. Federal Reserve launched an unprecedented monetary stimulus to support the economy. Gold's rally was also fueled by the European debt crisis and the credit agency Standard & Poor's first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating in the early 2010s. After peaking in 2011, gold dropped in value over several years as stocks bounced back and the U.S. dollar strengthened. Prices bottomed out around $1,100 in late 2015 ($1,480 in today's dollars) before heading back up. By 2020, gold had returned to above $1,800, boosted by the pandemic, record-low interest rates, and massive fiscal and monetary stimulus worldwide. In 2024, gold broke above $2,000 per ounce and hit record highs (nominal, meaning not adjusted for inflation). Current data is below. What returns could a $200 investment in gold have achieved over the past 20 years? Let's analyze the historical data and explore two different growth scenarios. For comparison, we've provided the shifts in the price of gold since 2000 and compared them with changes in the value of the S&P 500 index, which tracks 500 of the largest and most stable firms publicly traded in the U.S. and is used as a barometer for the stock market as a whole. Compound growth can significantly impact investment returns over long periods. Here's how different compounded annual growth rates (CAGRs) would affect a $200 gold investment over 20 years, ranging from the most conservative estimates that would merely keep up with inflation (say, 3%) to aggressive growth rates that reflect a very bullish long-term outlook (say 12%): Of course, gold's actual growth rate is unlikely to be smooth or predictable. Gold prices often shift significantly from year to year. These scenarios are thus hypothetical and not predictive of actual returns. They simply illustrate how different growth rate assumptions can impact investment outcomes. However, they illustrate the power of compounding over long time horizons. Investors should consider their own views and risk tolerance when evaluating the potential returns of gold over long periods. Gold prices are shaped by a range of economic, political, and market forces that interact. Understanding these price drivers can help you anticipate and navigate the twists and turns of the gold market. Of course, no one has a crystal ball, and unexpected events can always shake up even the best-calculated forecasts. The key is to be attentive to gold's ever-changing fundamentals while also maintaining a long-term perspective that aligns with your investment goals. At the most fundamental level, gold prices are a function of supply and demand. While gold mining adds to supply each year, gold's overall supply grows very slowly since most of the metal ever mined remains in existence as a store of value. On the demand side, gold is sought for both industrial uses and investment purposes. Jewelry fabrication and electronics manufacturing create a base level of demand, while investment demand can fluctuate more dramatically based on economic conditions and market sentiment. When gold demand outpaces supply, prices tend to rise. But for many, its an evergreen investment\u2014it's consistently popular with retail investors, and many years it's more popular than stocks for investments purposes, as the chart below shows. Broader financial market conditions can significantly impact the gold market. During periods of strong economic growth and rising corporate profits, gold may not perform as well as assets like stocks. Conversely, during recessions or bear markets, gold tends to do better because many people fleeing the stock market use gold as a safe haven to store some of their capital. Like many other financial assets, gold is influenced by momentum and investor sentiment. During bull markets in gold, when there are rising prices, this increase in value itself will attract more buyers into the market, fueling further gains. The opposite cycle can occur in bear markets, with everyone hoping not to be the last to bail as the price of gold tumbles. Professional investors and speculators can build on these momentum swings by trading large quantities of gold futures or ETFs. Media coverage, analyst forecasts, and technical chart patterns can also shape short-term gold market sentiment. Because of its long history as a universally recognized store of value and safe haven asset, gold is particularly sensitive to political instability. Wars, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and other shocks can dramatically boost demand for gold and its perceived safety. For example, gold prices surged to then-record highs in 1980 following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. More recently, tensions in the Middle East have helped fuel a gold rally. In addition to these acute events, slow-burning global trends like the rise of China and the supposed decline of U.S. hegemony may also shape gold's outlook over longer periods. The U.S. dollar's relative value heavily influences gold prices in foreign exchange (forex) markets. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially lowering international demand. Conversely, a weaker dollar can boost gold's appeal as an alternative store of value. Periods of dollar weakness, like the 1970s or the mid-2000s, have historically coincided with strong gold markets. Beyond the dollar, gold can also be affected by changes in the value of other major currencies like the euro, the Japanese yen, and the British pound. U.S. real interest rates, or nominal rates adjusted for inflation, are arguably the most critical driver of gold prices. Because gold offers no yield, it's typically more attractive when real interest rates are low or negative (i.e., when inflation is high). This means the opportunity cost of holding gold over other yield-bearing assets is lower. Meanwhile, high real interest rates make gold relatively less attractive. U.S. real interest rates peaked in the early 1980s amid then-U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker's inflation fight, ushering in a 20-year bear market for gold. Real interest rates plunged after the 2008 financial crisis, fueling gold's rally to record highs above $1,900. A chart of these rates since 1970 is below. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions often have an outsized effect on the gold market. By setting short-term interest rates and controlling the money supply, the Fed heavily influences real interest rates and the dollar's value, two critical variables for gold prices. Quantitative easing and other expansionary monetary policies are generally bullish for gold, as they tend to depress real interest rates and the dollar. Conversely, rate hikes and quantitative tightening can create headwinds for gold. Gold sold off sharply in 2013 during the \"Taper Tantrum\" following the Fed's suggestion it would wind down asset purchases. Similarly, gold came under pressure in 2022 as the Fed embarked on its fastest rate hike cycle since the 1980s to combat soaring inflation. Over the past decades, gold and stocks have seen alternating periods of outperformance. In the 1970s, gold soared while stocks slumped amid high inflation and economic stagnation. The 1980s and 1990s saw stocks take the lead as gold languished. Gold shone again in the 2000s as the dot-com bubble burst, and later, the financial crisis unfolded. Stocks ultimately recovered and pushed upward toward new highs in the 2010s.\u00a0During the 2020s, both stocks and gold have seen new all-time highs.From 2003 through 2023, gold returned about 8.9% annually, slightly outperforming the S&P 500's 8.4% annual return (excluding dividends). However, the S&P 500 averaged over 10% annually, including dividends. Gold's returns were less impressive over a longer time horizon. From 1971 through 2023, gold returned under 8% compared with the 10.7% total return for the S&P 500.Of course, past performance doesn't guarantee future results, and investors are wise to maintain a well-diversified portfolio that includes several asset classes. The best asset allocation varies based on an individual's financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Thus, investors should consider gold a potential component of a diversified portfolio, not a stand-alone investment. And, as with any investment, it's prudent to consult with a financial advisor to determine whether and how gold fits into your broader financial plan. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was launched in 2009. From 2014 to 2024, bitcoin returned a massive 68% annually vs. 8.5% for gold over the same period. However, these eye-popping returns came with extreme volatility and price crashes. Gold offers several potential benefits for investors seeking to diversify their portfolios and hedge against various economic and market risks. One of gold's primary advantages is its historically low correlation to other asset classes like stocks and bonds. This means that gold prices often move independently of other financial markets, potentially providing a buffer against market downturns or volatility. By adding gold to a portfolio, investors may be able to improve risk-adjusted returns and reduce overall portfolio volatility.Another key benefit of gold is its reputation as an inflation hedge. Over long periods, gold has demonstrated a tendency to maintain its purchasing power, making it an attractive store of value during times of rising prices or currency debasement. This was particularly evident during the high inflation of the 1970s and the early 2000s when the U.S. dollar weakened. Gold's status as a tangible, universally recognized asset has also made it a sought-after safe haven during periods of economic or geopolitical uncertainty. Investors often flock to gold during market crashes, financial crises, or political instability, as seen during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 market turmoil in 2020.While gold does not provide regular income like bonds or dividend-paying stocks, it does have a history of price appreciation, albeit with its ups and downs. Some portfolio optimization studies suggest that putting a small part of an investment portfolio in gold can improve risk-adjusted returns. Despite its potential benefits, investing in gold also carries several risks that investors must consider. One of the most significant risks is gold's price volatility. While often viewed as a stable store of value over the long term, gold prices can fluctuate dramatically in the short term based on a variety of factors, as well as experience prolonged bear markets. This volatility can be particularly challenging for investors with shorter time horizons or lower risk tolerance.Another potential drawback of gold as an investment is its lack of income generation. Unlike bonds, which pay regular interest, or stocks, which can pay dividends, gold does not produce any cash flow. This lack of income can create an opportunity cost for investors, particularly in higher interest-rate environments where income-generating assets may be more attractive. Investors who opt to own physical gold bullion must also contend with storage and security challenges. Secure storage and insurance for gold bars or coins can be costly and logistically complex, often requiring allocated storage with a bullion dealer or a bank safe deposit box, which come with additional fees and potential counterparty risks. Long-term store of value Inflation hedge Portfolio diversifier Safe haven asset Volatility No dividend or cash flows Costs to secure physical gold May underperform other assets like stocks One of the first decisions gold investors must make is which form of gold to invest in. The three main options are often physical gold bullion (bars or coins), gold ETFs, and gold mining stocks. Ultimately, the choice between physical gold, gold ETFs, and gold mining stocks depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and desired level of direct exposure to gold prices. Many investors choose to allocate funds across all three categories to balance the risks and rewards of each. Timing gold purchases is challenging, as a myriad economic, geopolitical, and market factors can influence gold prices. However, some general principles can guide your timing decisions. Ultimately, trying to perfectly time gold purchases is difficult even for professional investors. A more prudent approach for most individual investors is to focus on their long-term allocation strategy and use tools like DCA to manage timing risk. Finally, diversification is crucial when investing in gold or any other asset class. By spreading your investments across multiple assets, sectors, and geographies, you can reduce portfolio risk and volatility. It's thus important to view gold as just one part of a larger investment portfolio. In the U.S., physical gold is classified as a collectible for tax purposes, resulting in higher long-term capital gains rates than securities like stocks or bonds. Gold ETFs and mining stocks are taxed as investments. In either case, they would be subject to capital gains tax (the rate depending on the holding period). Gold is often considered a hedge against inflation, as it is thought to increase in value as the buying power of the dollar declines. However, its actual track record has been mixed. In fact, evidence shows that gold hasn\u2019t always been a good hedge against inflation. It all depends on the time frame you are considering. For example, gold investors lost 10% on average from 1980 to 1984 in real terms when the annual inflation rate was about 6.5%. Gold is a rare and precious metal with unique properties: it is durable and long-lasting, conducts electricity well, is malleable, has an attractive luster and shine, and is resistant to corrosion and oxidation. This makes it useful in a wide range of applications. Gold is also relatively scarce, making it increasingly difficult to find and extract from the earth. Most importantly, however, gold is precious because of its social and cultural importance. Gold has recently seen new all-time highs (in nominal terms). A $200 investment in gold could grow at least four times over 20 years based if historical growth rates hold. But that depends on exactly when your money is invested. Indeed, gold prices are unpredictable, and gains aren't guaranteed. As part of a diversified portfolio, gold can serve as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty. Still, it's crucial to understand the risks involved and invest with a long time horizon in mind. While not a \"get rich quick\" scheme, disciplined gold investing can augment your wealth over time.

            "title": "My Company Is Offering Shares to Employees. Should I Buy Them?",
            "content": "Maybe, but don't overdo it Getty Images / Cecilie_Arcurs If the company you work for is publicly traded, you may have the opportunity to buy shares of its stock, possibly at a substantial discount from what other investors must pay. Should you take up the offer? And, if so, how much money should you consider investing? The key to making those decisions is to try to approach them dispassionately, as you would with any other potential investment. This article can help you decide. Companies offer shares to their employees for a variety of reasons. One is to build loyalty\u2014an employee who is financially invested in a company may be emotionally invested in it as well and put in a greater effort toward making it successful. Companies also offer shares, often at a reduced price, as an incentive in recruiting and retaining talented employees. From a company perspective, including stock as a part of an employee's pay package can also be more affordable than paying them entirely in cash. This is particularly common at startups, which usually need their cash for other purposes. Many companies also use stock options for much the same purposes. Unlike shares of stock, stock options simply give employees the right to buy shares at a set price at a certain point in the future. If the stock rises in value in the meantime, the employee can later \"exercise\" their options and buy the shares at the bargain price. Now that they own the actual shares, the employee can either sell them at a profit or hang onto them in hopes of further appreciation. Depending on your company, you may have several different ways to buy shares. These can include: In an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), the company sells shares directly to workers, often through automatic payroll deductions. In addition to not having to pay brokerage commissions, employees often get a discount on the shares, frequently on the order of 15%. Typically, there are no restrictions on when the employee can sell their shares. ESPPs are similar to employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), which are another common way for employees to obtain shares of their company's stock. The key difference is that in ESPPs, the employee buys the shares with their own money, while in ESOPs, the company provides them free of charge, often as a form of retirement plan. Many companies offer their own stock as one of the investment options in employees' 401(k) retirement plans. Some companies also use shares of their stock, rather than cash, when they match their workers' voluntary contributions to these plans. Maximum value of employer stock you can purchase each year through most ESPPs. As with any kind of investment, company stock has some pluses and minuses. As mentioned earlier, determining whether to invest in the company you work for is a decision that is best approached dispassionately, whether you love your company, hate it, or fall somewhere in between. Here are some questions to ask yourself to help you decide. Can you afford it? Depending on your income and the various financial demands you face, you may not have a lot of spare cash for investment purposes at this stage of your life. So you'll want to be selective in the investments you choose and, sentiment aside, buying shares in your employer may not be your best option. Would you invest in this company if you didn't work for it? Here is what to consider: How has the company performed relative to others in its industry? Is its industry growing, relatively stable, or slowly dying? Do its managers articulate a strategic vision that makes sense or simply fall back on the latest buzzwords? Do you believe the company to be well-run based on what you've seen from the inside? What do professional investment analysts think? Aside from your own opinions, what do other, possibly more objective observers have to say? If you have a brokerage account, that firm may have research and recommendations regarding your company that are accessible online. You can also find information on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) website. Is any discount you're offered enough to make up for whatever reservations you might have? If you're on the fence about whether your company is a smart investment, a sizable discount from its current market price could be a deciding factor, especially if you expect to sell relatively soon. Will it throw your asset allocation out of whack? Owning too much stock\u2014especially too much of any one stock\u2014could mean taking on more risk than is appropriate for someone in your situation. This can be particularly important as you get closer to retirement. Probably not. In a large company, higher-ups may pay little attention to who is or isn't buying shares or have no way of knowing. If you're in an executive position, however, there may be some expectation (subtle or otherwise) that you participate in the company's employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), if only to set an example for others. Insider trading is an illegal activity, in which company insiders (or outsiders they are in cahoots with) act on important information that's not available to the public to buy or sell shares of their stock. That depends on how you obtained them. If you bought your shares through an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), they're yours to sell as soon as you take possession of them. However, if you received them through an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), you may have to wait until a qualifying event occurs, such as retirement or leaving the company, before you can receive a distribution of your shares. Even then, distributions may occur in installments rather than a lump sum. Your company should clearly spell out its vesting schedule and distribution rules. As a general rule, most financial planners and other experts say it's prudent to have no more than 10% of your portfolio in any one stock, including your employer's. From an employee point of view, the principal difference between an ESPP and an ESOP is who pays for the shares. In an ESPP, the employee buys them. In an ESOP, the employer provides them free of charge. Shares of stock in the company you work for can be a good investment if the company is well-run and appears to have a solid future. That's especially true if you're offered a substantial discount off the regular market price, as is often the case. However, it's also important to stay properly diversified and not load up on company stock simply because it's cheap or easy.

            "title": "Best Tech Stocks for November 2024",
            "content": "These are some of the best tech stocks based on best value, fastest growth, and most momentum SOPA Images\u00a0/\u00a0Getty Images The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) saw modest gains in October, up 2% as earnings season began. Below is an analysis of the top\u00a0tech stocks\u00a0for November 2024, screened for best value, fastest growth, and most momentum. All stocks are listed on the Nasdaq or\u00a0New York Stock Exchange.We also excluded stocks with a price under $5, an average daily\u00a0trading volume\u00a0of less than 100,000, and a\u00a0market cap\u00a0of less than $300 million. All data are current as of Oct. 28, 2024. Value investing\u00a0is an investing strategy that holds that investors can identify stocks trading below their true value. At the time the market corrects this mispricing, these undervalued names may increase in value. Investors typically attempt to identify undervalued stocks using fundamental metrics like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Typically, a lower P/E ratio signals an undervalued stock because it means the company is valued less than its fundamental value. These stocks may offer a stronger return after the market adjusts. Growth\u00a0investors believe that increases in a company's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) can be an indicator of a strong business that has the potential to increase in value. However, focusing on just one of these two metrics can give an incomplete picture of a company's growth potential. Circumstances unrelated to a company's fundamental business strength\u2014such as tax law changes, mergers, or one-off gains\u2014can skew these figures on their own. Investopedia uses a dual-metric approach to reach a more balanced assessment of growth companies. We equally weight the latest year-over-year (YOY) percentage growth for both EPS and revenue. This approach aims to reduce the impact of those one-time anomalies to provide a better view of a company's true growth pattern and potential. Additionally, any companies with growth in excess of 1,000% are excluded as outliers. Momentum investing is a strategy aiming to capitalize on pre-existing market trends by focusing on stocks that have outpaced their peers or the broader market on returns. This investment principal holds that stocks on an upward path are likely to continue to outperform, as long as fundamental aspects of the business, industry, or sector do not change. Momentum investing is a common strategy applied to tech stocks because they regularly experience significant market disruptions. As companies launch new products, announce technological breakthroughs, and gain rapid popularity, investors have the potential to climb on board while these stocks are still ascending. Here are the tech stocks with the highest total return in the last 12 months. Tech stocks, particularly those in emerging areas, are known for experiencing some of the sharpest growth of any publicly traded company. Anticipating this, investors have sought periods in which the sector underperforms to invest heavily, as they expect significant growth over the long term. But growth among tech stocks can vary dramatically. Many of the larger firms have limited growth potential because their market saturation and capitalization are already very high. Small-cap or penny tech stocks that experience technological breakthroughs or suddenly become incredibly popular may have periods of massive growth. Unusually, some of the biggest names in tech\u2014including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)\u2014have continued to grow at significant rates. Tech trends are always changing, with companies aiming to capitalize on the latest technology and to guide and follow developments in innovation. This makes the sector primed for breakthroughs. One of the most recent major trends to sweep the tech sector has been AI-related technologies, which are increasingly integrated into companies across many industries and sectors. To the extent that some tech companies continue to play a role in making this possible, they stand to benefit from the ongoing AI trend. Tech stocks are known for their high volatility, where rapid technological changes and competitive pressures can lead to significant price fluctuations. They often carry high valuations based on growth expectations, making them susceptible to market corrections if they fail to meet these projections. Furthermore, regulatory challenges and geopolitical tensions can impact the sector, introducing additional risks and uncertainties for investors. The sharp gains of many tech firms can prove tempting to investors who may not be well-versed in the technologies themselves. With rapid innovation characterizing the sector, trends and prospects shift very quickly as well. Investors who are unprepared for this pace or who lack knowledge of the fundamental strengths of different tech companies may find themselves following a trend that has already changed. Growth potential Advanced innovation Tech sector turbulence and rich valuations Investors may be left behind with rapidly shifting trends The tech sector's performance in 2024 is poised to be significantly influenced by advancements in AI, which is expected to drive long-term growth. The adoption of AI, along with ongoing digitization and cloud computing, offers promising opportunities, particularly for companies involved in semiconductor production and cloud software services. \u00a0However, the macroeconomic environment will also play a key role in determining the sector's short-term performance, with the potential for volatility depending on interest-rate policies and economic conditions\u200b.

However, tax rules that concern cryptocurrencies can be harder to navigate than those for other asset classes. Given the novelty of the technology, many investors don\u2019t fully understand how cryptocurrency taxes should be calculated and filed. Some investors might not even be aware that taxes should be reported. New tax laws and regulations are constantly being introduced to keep up with recent developments in the technology. Informed discussions can help investors cut to the chase and stay on top of these requirements. Here\u2019s how financial advisors can prepare for conversations about crypto taxes with clients. In the United States, cryptocurrencies are treated as property and taxed as investment income, ordinary income, gifts, or donations for tax purposes at the state and federal levels. Tax laws vary by state and territory but are the same for individuals, corporations, and funds federally. The cryptocurrency can be anything from bitcoin or ether to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) products. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the federal tax agency that handles taxes across all U.S. states and territories. Federally, long-term capital gains are taxed according to a sliding scale that depends on income level and is capped at a fixed percentage. Tax rates for short-term capital gains and ordinary income are equal to the tax rate of the annual income tax bracket corresponding to the tax filing status of an individual, a business, or an investment fund. Tax-registered entities such as corporations, nonprofits, and limited partnerships pay different tax rates, including variations between S corporations (S corps), limited liability companies (LLCs), and other corporate structures. Ordinary income may include self-employment taxes if the crypto was paid as a wage. Gifts worth less than a certain amount don\u2019t carry federal tax implications and don\u2019t need to be reported to the IRS. After they hit that limit, gift taxes apply and increase based on their taxable value up to 40%. Virtual currency received as a gift is not considered income until it is sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of. Donations made in crypto can be deducted from gross income to lower taxable income, similar to standard and itemized tax deductions. Many investors might not know that quarterly estimated taxes must be filed if they expect to owe more than $1,000 in crypto taxes on their annual federal tax return. Discussing cryptocurrency taxes with clients is important to minimize their tax liabilities for financial planning purposes and to avoid potential consequences from tax authorities. Failing to file returns and pay the correct amount of taxes could result in time-consuming audits and stiff penalties from financial regulators. Investors may be tax-advantaged by moving to other states and territories, trading in certain volumes and frequencies, or calculating taxes with reference prices that present less capital gains taxes. The IRS and some states ask about cryptocurrencies on tax forms and have dedicated personnel to figure out if taxes aren\u2019t reported. Popular crypto exchanges\u2014like Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini\u2014share data on customers who earn above a certain threshold of cryptocurrency income in a taxable year. Cryptocurrency and blockchain analysis companies\u2014like Chainalysis, Elliptic, and TRM Labs\u2014are contracted to trace unreported transaction activity and correlate it with known identities. Some states or territories don't impose income taxes or capital gains taxes. Other states or territories don't collect personal taxes\u2014but do levy corporate taxes\u2014and could offer generous tax breaks and incentives for digital assets. Federally, cryptocurrencies sold after one year are taxed at long-term capital gains rates. Short-term capital gains are taxed at the same rate as income. What's more, every trade is taxed no matter the size of the transaction, whether cashing out from crypto to fiat currency or converting between different tokens. Taxes on crypto holdings recognized as investment income\u2014or when the crypto transaction functionally becomes a trade\u2014are calculated using a cost basis. The IRS views cryptocurrency as property, so it is accounted for as a capital asset for tax purposes. If it is stored as inventory for ordinary business uses, it could be accounted for using accounting methods like FIFO and LIFO. Most long-term investors will have to use a cost basis for tax purposes. A capital loss is booked if the cost basis of the asset\u2014or the purchase price plus transaction fees, commissions, and acquisition costs\u2014is higher than the sale price it sold for, less transaction fees, commissions, and acquisition costs. A capital gain is booked if the sale price is higher than the cost basis. Thus, in some circumstances: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming don\u2019t have income or capital gains taxes. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory that doesn\u2019t require capital gains or federal taxes. It\u2019s important to be aware of the distinction between tax planning and tax advice. Financial advisors who are not licensed to prepare tax returns can work with clients for tax planning purposes. For example, you might recommend that clients set aside enough money to cover taxes or inform them of their likely tax rate. But you should avoid offering more direct, specific tax advice. Tax advisors, on the other hand, are licensed to prepare tax returns and can offer more specific advice about which tax forms clients must file or what they are required to report. If a financial advisor offers tax advice without the necessary permissions or licenses and gives a client faulty advice, it could open them and their firm up to legal liability. Therefore, when it comes to discussing crypto taxes\u2014or any taxes\u2014with clients, bear in mind the kind of advice or information that you\u2019re able to offer clients and that which should be left to tax professionals instead. You can recommend clients meet with a tax advisor for specific tax advice. Accordingly, to prepare for your conversation with a client, aim to understand what cryptocurrencies they\u2019ve held and how they\u2019ve interacted with them. Without knowing how the assets were obtained and valued, you can\u2019t calculate how much they owe in taxes or distinguish if they\u2019re taxed as investment income, ordinary income, gifts, or donations. Clarify for clients that those working with a tax advisor will need to compile records indicating: These records can usually be downloaded from the crypto exchange or platform where the trades or transfers happened. While it would be beyond the scope of expertise of a typical financial advisor, a tax advisor should find out what tax forms the client is required to file. That includes confirming their state or territory of residence. As mentioned, taxes differ across each state or territory and involve unique forms. Federal tax forms are standardized across the U.S., regardless of state or territory. For crypto assets that clients continue to hold and haven\u2019t yet liquidated, gauge your client\u2019s financial goals and contingencies. Your advice will differ if they are moving to another state or territory shortly or prefer to sell all their crypto this year instead of holding them for another decade before making changes. Some clients could be short on cash and need to free up wealth soon. Others might be well-positioned to have longer investment horizons. Be aware that there are several mathematical formulas and concepts that cryptocurrency owners in the U.S. must understand if they want to calculate their cryptocurrency taxes. These relate to cost basis, sale price, capital gains, and losses. The cost basis is the initial value paid to buy a token or the value at which the token was received (price multiplied by the number of units), plus any entry and acquisition costs, which could include transaction and commission fees. The cost basis is essential for calculating the value of crypto assets of any tax distinction, including investment income, non-investment income, gifts, and donations. Crypto investors tend to deal with various cost bases due to characteristic market volatility and fluctuating transaction fees. The sale price is the final value at which a token is liquidated for cash or swapped for another crypto (price times number of units), minus exit and selling costs, which could include transaction and commission fees. The sale price comes into play only when capital gains or losses need to be calculated\u2014or, in other words, when the crypto is taxed as investment income. Capital gains or losses apply only to cryptocurrencies that are part of discretionary trades taxed as investment income, when a crypto is bought and sold for cash, and when it is converted between two different assets. The capital gain or loss is the sale price minus the cost basis of a traded position. It is also referred to as return on investment (ROI). The topic of taxation is filled with complex subjects that you or your clients' tax advisors should break down clearly. That way, those investing in crypto won't need to clarify the same issues repeatedly and can make judgment calls that will benefit them the most over time. Starting small could lay the groundwork. You can help educate clients on basic concepts. Then, work your way up to more advanced concepts or advise them to contact their tax advisor. Offering examples with hypothetical numbers can be a good way to begin to illustrate how a tax subject works. For instance, you can say, \u201cIf someone bought $10,000 in Bitcoin and sold it for $15,000, they have to pay either income or capital gains taxes on that $5,000,\u201d to help a client understand the concept of capital gains. From there, the examples can be tailored to a client\u2019s particular tax situation. Numbers can be adjusted to reflect specific crypto holding amounts. Calculations can be drawn out with the assistance of visual aids and software programs, such as drawing boards, educational videos, and tax calculators. Clients may find tax forms intimidating and need a tax expert to distill them. Walking through the tax forms step by step, along with the state, territory, or federal tax agency\u2019s corresponding instructions, could eliminate confusion that clients will likely have when they try to fill them out. The more complicated examples demanding demonstrative teaching aids will likely involve explaining how to calculate capital gains or losses across multiple crypto assets and multiple tax distinctions, such as investment and ordinary income. Here are some examples to illustrate some of these advanced concepts: A crypto gift of $1,000 of bitcoin would incur a taxable capital gain of $1,000 if it is converted into $2,000 of ether after 12 months of holding. It would be taxed as ordinary income if exchanged before holding it for 12 months. If a client receives a cryptocurrency as a gift, they count the time the giver held it in their holding period. However, there must be documentation of the period. If there is no documentation proving the giver's holding time, the receiver's holding period starts the day after they receive it. Multiple cryptocurrency transactions can trigger different types of taxes, which is why it's important for clients to keep a log of their transactions. This log helps them or a tax professional determine how a transaction will be taxed. Here's an example\u2014for simplicity, blockchain and exchange fees are left out, along with any other costs incurred, and market values remain constant, so the basis remains the purchase price: Tax events would look like this: The investor would include $3 in ordinary income from cryptocurrency on their 2022 tax return. On their 2023 tax return, they would report $1 in capital gains and $1 in ordinary income from cryptocurrency transactions. Crypto exchanges domiciled in the U.S. are legally required to report account activity on customers who gained at least $600 on their trades every year. Exchanges send documents with this information, Form 1099-B, Form 1099-K, and Form 1099-MISC, to the IRS and the customer at the end of the tax year. Expect clients to pose several questions about cryptocurrency taxes. Being ready to clarify the most common questions can help to quickly smooth over most concerns. That can be achieved by researching ahead of time and identifying which issues are mentioned often. Again, be mindful of how you, as a financial advisor, can help. Here are some questions that frequently pop up regarding cryptocurrency taxes: Clients might want financial advisors to exercise an outcome-based approach and give them a concrete perspective on their tax obligations. These numbers don\u2019t need to be exact but should provide an estimate of the client\u2019s tax rate. Cryptocurrencies are taxed based on how they were acquired, how long they are held, and how they are used\u2014not their names. For example, a single crypto asset, like bitcoin or ether, could be taxed differently than another if it came from different sources. Multiple crypto assets, popular or niche, could be taxed similarly if they came from similar sources. The tax rate specific to the source will apply to only the amount of crypto that came from the source at a given time. Taxes calculated across different sources are then added up by category to determine the overall tax owed. Sources include exchanges, mining, staking, interest, airdrops, and family and friends. Clients look for cost-cutting measures in their everyday budgets, spending habits, and tax liabilities. Knowing as many applicable tax codes, investment products, and financial mathematics as possible will help you explain the most effective tax-saving strategies and prevent oversight of options that could have been considered. While a financial advisor\u2019s job is to provide guidance, not every responsibility falls on their shoulders. Financial advisors are there to give general advice, tips, and pointers to improve financial health with a holistic view. They are not there to perform accounting down to an exact number, submit taxes on behalf of a client, project every tax arbitrage potential, and act as counsel parsing the law. It\u2019s virtually impossible to provide effective financial planning services without doing some math. For example, a cost-effective breakeven point could be assessed between the tax savings plus brokerage fees charged on a crypto IRA vs. the tax costs plus transaction fees of crypto traded on an exchange. However, tax calculations and projections need to be examined in conclusive detail and officially signed off by a certified tax professional. Financial advisors can refer clients to licensed accountants, actuaries, auditors, and lawyers to establish and forecast precise numbers and legal compliance. It is especially practical for heavy crypto investors to hire an accountant to finalize their taxes\u2014and an auditor if the investments are for a business or a fund. Anticipate your client\u2019s needs while balancing and communicating your broadly defined duties as a financial advisor. The goal is to act as a structured starting point and springboard for more intermediate and advanced financial planning ideas and processes. Anyone can calculate taxes with crypto tax preparation software, which can automatically calculate taxes and extract data uploaded from more than one crypto wallet, exchange, and blockchain. Using software may be unavoidable if a client handles a high volume of crypto transactions. Cryptocurrency is still relatively new, and the regulation of it is evolving. Staying current on the market and how it is taxed is critical to assisting clients investing in it. The best sources of recent and timely tax information are tax agencies. The IRS and state and territory tax departments have FAQ pages and webpages discussing digital asset tax accounting and related publications. Major cryptocurrency exchanges and cryptocurrency news sites have blog posts and articles with the latest changes and materials about cryptocurrency taxation. However, it is more accurate and comprehensive to get the information straight from the source: the tax regulators and other regulatory bodies. Yes, IRS rules allow you to point out which specific units of crypto were sold. To do so, you must identify the unit by an identifier or transaction record. Parceling out specific batches can be helpful if you sell crypto with different cost bases and want more discretion in calculating capital gains or losses. State tax forms vary, but federal tax forms are standard at the IRS. For individual tax returns, investment income is reported on Form 1040, Schedule D, and Form 8949. Ordinary income is reported for employee work on Form 1040 and for contractor work on Schedule C, Part I, with self-employment income and other compensation. Gifts, including receipts of crypto donations, are reported on Form 709. Donors of crypto can deduct the donations on Form 1040, Schedule A. Income is reported on Form 1120 for corporate tax returns and on Form 1065 for limited partnership fund returns. The cost basis of a cryptocurrency transaction, if it isn\u2019t clear, may need to be treated as $0 when it is sold. That means paying capital gains tax on the full proceeds from the sale. Cryptocurrencies are taxed in myriad ways, presenting various tax savings that can be brought into focus and customized for individual clients with broad guidance from a financial advisor or specific, expert advice from a tax advisor. As a financial advisor, be sure that you understand the kind of advice that you can offer your clients about crypto taxes and when to recommend that they speak with a tax or other professional.

            "title": "What Is EUV, and How Does It Work?",
            "content": "Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography Is Used in Semiconductor Device Fabrication to Make Integrated Circuits Investopedia / Joules Garcia Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is a method of printing intricate patterns onto semiconductor materials. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light technology is a key driver of change in the semiconductor industry. Lithography, the method used for printing intricate patterns onto semiconductor materials, has advanced by using ever shorter wavelengths since the beginning of the semiconductor age. EUV lithography is the shortest yet. In development for decades, the first EUV lithography machine bought in batches and ready for production was from ASML, the Dutch semiconductor company. EUV light refers to the extreme ultraviolet light used for microchip lithography, which involves coating the microchip wafer in a photosensitive material and carefully exposing it to light. This prints a pattern onto the wafer, which is used for further steps in the microchip design process. The history of computers is the history of the semiconductor industry, which in turn is the history of the relentless pursuit of miniaturization. In the sector\u2019s initial phase from the 1950s to mid-\u201980s, photolithography was done through UV light and photomasks to project circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. During this time, Moore\u2019s Law\u2014the 1960s dictum that the number of transistors on a microchip would double every two years\u2014started coming up against the physical limits of this process. This meant that the staggering increases in computing power and reduced technology costs for consumers were also in danger of hitting a limit. From the 1980s to the 2000s, deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography drove the next generation of miniaturization, using shorter wavelengths in the range of 153 to 248 nanometers, which allowed for smaller imprints on the silicon wafers of semiconductors. In leading up to the new millennium, researchers and competing firms worldwide looked for breakthroughs in making EUV lithography and its even shorter wavelengths possible. ASML completed a prototype in 2003, though it would take another decade to develop a system ready for production. Every few years since then, ASML has delivered the next iteration of its EUV lithography systems with more capacity for production and wavelengths down to 13.5 nanometers. This allows for incredibly precise microchip designs and the densest possible placement of transistors on microchips\u2014in short, it enables faster computer speeds. ASML\u2019s EUV lithography systems emit light with wavelengths of about 13.5 nanometers, which is significantly shorter than the wavelengths used in the previous generation of DUV lithography, thus enabling finer patterns to be printed on semiconductor wafers\u200b. The most advanced microchips can have nodes as small as 7, 5, and 3 nanometers, which are made by repeatedly passing the semiconductor wafers through the EUV lithography system. Though you won\u2019t be able to follow these steps in your garage workshop to make semiconductors, they are important for understanding how the technology involved can be advanced and where potential investment funds might be best placed. First, a high-intensity laser is directed at a material (usually tin) to generate plasma (charged electrons and protons in motion). The plasma then emits the EUV light at a wavelength of about 13.5 nanometers. The generated light is gathered and directed through a series of mirrors and optics through a mask or reticle as a circuit pattern is placed in the path of the EUV light, in a manner loosely analogous to using a stencil to paint a pattern on a board. A material called photoresist on the wafer is sensitive to EUV light, and the areas exposed to it go through a chemical change and are then etched. New materials may then be deposited in the etched areas to form the various components of the microchip. This process can be repeated up to 100 times with different masks to create multilayered, complex circuits on a single wafer. After these steps, the wafer undergoes further processes to remove impurities and get the chip ready to be sliced into individual chips. They are then packaged for use in electronic devices. While major purchases of EUV lithography systems have been driving news in the superconductor industry, given the dramatic costs involved and the technological advances it could bring, DUV lithography is still more widely used. It has the advantage of already being in manufacturing facilities with staff trained in its use. EUV lithography, with its extremely short wavelengths of about 13.5 nanometers, allows for finer etching of smaller features on chips. For its part, DUV lithography operates at wavelengths starting at 153 nanometers. While chipmakers can use this for designs with sizes as small as 5 nanometers or less, pushing the boundaries of physics, DUV light can only be used for sub-10-nanometer sizes with a loss in resolution quality. EUV lithography systems not only come with the startup costs of newer technologies but also are inherently more expensive than the equipment and maintenance for DUV lithography. For example, EUV lithography systems installed by Intel in 2023 cost $150 million each. This cost makes DUV lithography systems preferred for uses where EUV lithography\u2019s smaller size is unnecessary. DUV lithography is also a known quantity: There is no need for additional training, new facilities, and other major capital investments that EUV light systems require. DUV light technology is still needed for many chips in phones, computers, cars, and robots, and it has proved robust and versatile. Its relatively simpler processes also mean that DUV lithography can produce more chips per unit of time than EUV lithography, an important point in its favor in light of the global demand for semiconductors. Many expect DUV lithography to remain popular for years to come. This is in part because of the price of EUV lithography and the technical issues that come with any new technology. In addition, DUV lithograph technology is not stuck in place, continuing to improve how it helps create the chips found in the many electronic devices of our everyday lives. The industry is likely in a transition, and while EUV light will play an increasingly more central role in chip manufacturing, DUV lithography is still vital to the production of electronics used in our everyday lives. EUV lithography is a relatively new technology that brings many advantages and some drawbacks to consider. EUV lithography brings many advantages that could lead to future developments in microchip production. Here are two of the reasons why semiconductor companies like Intel are investing so much in the technology: EUV lithography has many benefits, but as a new technology, it\u2019s important to consider its drawbacks. Yes, ASML is the only company that makes and sells products that use EUV lithography systems for microchip lithography. Technology is frequently improving, and the demand for microchips with increasingly dense transistors continues. While EUV lithography is at the limits of the technology, research into technology that could improve upon or replace it continues. Multi-e-beam, X-ray lithography, nanoimprint lithography, and quantum lithography could all overtake EUV lithography in the future. Extreme ultraviolet light is used in the production of microchips. EUV lithography prints a pattern on silicon wafers during the manufacturing process. Moore\u2019s Law says that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every two years. This means that computers get faster and more capable every two years, with that growth being exponential. The law is named after Gordon E. Moore, a co-founder of Intel. Though it held true for many years, some predict it will end in the 2020s. EUV light is used in microchip lithography to produce the patterns necessary to create a microchip, though at far smaller sizes than from previous lithographic techniques. However, because of its novelty, only one company\u2014ASML\u2014makes machines that use it, and they are costly. As the technology matures, it should play a central role in future developments in microchip production. Harry J.

The manual upload feature enables you to add any investment you own, including personal real estate, with the exception of short sale transactions. The initial setup enables tracking of current and future holdings; any historical transactions must be uploaded manually. Sharesight automatically updates and records dividend payments, share splits, and other relevant corporate actions. The initial upload entails logging into a brokerage account, creating a transaction report, downloading it and then uploading the report to Sharesight. Keeping your future transactions updated requires you, or your broker, to email transactions to Sharesight or to use \u201cSharesight Connect,\u201d a broker-Sharesight integration. The upload process is a bit clunky and more complicated than platforms like Quicken and Empower.

Those who want to delve into a wide range of investment analyses will appreciate Quicken or Morningstar Investor. Ultimately, portfolio management software is a tool, like a scale, to use for financial goal setting and planning so that you can reach your preferred lifestyle in the future. Portfolio management software refers to computer programs that organize, update, and report on financial investment portfolios. Many investors have accounts populated with stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds. The portfolio management software is akin to a digital filing cabinet. The programs let users view their accounts and assets. Within the programs you can also create a variety of reports to help you understand your investment growth, cash flow, and more. Like any software choice, the process begins with assessing your needs. Consider the types of assets that you need to track. Sophisticated investors might need software that tracks options, futures, or other advanced asset classes, while most investors will be satisfied with a portfolio management platform that can manage basic stocks, bonds, funds, real estate, and debt. Ensure that the portfolio management software that you select can be linked to your online accounts and easily updated. Investigate the available reports and make sure that the retirement planning tools are consistent with your preferences. Once you\u2019ve clarified your needs, review the available platforms and select the one that is the best fit for your finances and investments. The best portfolio management software is the program that fits your pre-determined preferences. The software should be able to track and analyze your assets and provide the most useful reports for your financial situation. If you have many investments across multiple accounts, search for a sophisticated and comprehensive platform. If you\u2019re focused on retirement planning, consider software with robust retirement planning tools. There\u2019s no one best portfolio management software program, only the right platform for your budget and financial reporting needs. No, stock trading and portfolio management are two distinct types of services. Portfolio management software isn\u2019t designed for stock trading. Stock trading is best done through an investment brokerage firm such as Fidelity, E*TRADE, or Schwab. Or you might consider stock trading through an app such as Robinhood or Webull. While most investment brokers offer basic insights into your existing portfolio such as cost basis, capital gains, dividends and asset allocation, they typically do not integrate all of your outside accounts into their information. Portfolio management software is designed to accompany your investment brokerage accounts and consolidate financial tracking, reports, and insights. Portfolio management software makes it easy to check your net worth, gains, and losses, and view the overall diversification of the assets you own. To find the best portfolio software management software tools available, we examined several leading platforms based on usability, trackable assets, manageable account types, fees, and investment insights, as well as the quality of goal planning and tax tools. d3sign / Getty Images Helpl Quicken. \"Analyze My Portfolio.\" Sharesight. \"Our Story.\" Sharesight. \"Supported Forex Currencies.\" Sharesight. \"Frequently Asked Quiestions - What Can I Track In Sharesight?\" Sharesight. \"Best Portfolio and Dividend Tracker.\" Sharesight. \"Plans and Pricing.\" Kubera. \"How Kubera Works.\" Kubera Blog. \"Personal Capital vs Mint vs Kubera.\" Morningstar. \"morningstar x-ray overview.\""

            "title": "How to Buy Dividend Stocks",
            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn how to get started with dividend stocks TravelCouples / Getty Images Buying dividend-paying stocks or dividend stock funds is a great way to obtain passive income from a stock portfolio. A portfolio consisting of dividend-paying stocks can compound significantly over many years. This article will outline how to add dividend-paying stocks to your portfolio and further outline the benefits and risks of dividend-paying stocks and funds. Buying a stock that pays a dividend is as simple as buying any other stock. The investor opens an account at a brokerage firm, researches the dividend-paying stock or fund they want to purchase, then purchases the stock or fund through the broker\u2019s order entry system. Buying dividend stocks is a relatively straightforward process. The investor opens and funds an account, researches the stock or fund they want to purchase, makes the purchase, and then monitors their position. Here\u2019s how it works. Step 1: Open a brokerage account. Opening an account is a very easy process and can be done online. Accounts can be opened quickly, and do not require funding immediately. Dividend investing is not as intense as swing or other more active trading styles, so most online brokers are suitable for this more passive investment strategy that usually entails buying and holding positions, rather than actively trading them. Step 2: Fund your account. The investor needs to fund their account once it has been approved and created. This can be done by ACH bank transfer, wire transfer, check, or by transfer from an existing investment account. Step 3: Choose your stocks. Choosing dividend stocks or funds to invest in has become easier thanks to stock screeners available from most online brokers. The investor can use the screener to filter for dividend-paying stocks first, and you can also filter for a dividend yield above a certain rate. The dividend yield of individual stocks should be compared to the level of interest rates, as well as the dividend yield of other stocks within the same industry or market sector. Once you have identified some good dividend-yielding stock candidates, determine the types of companies you want to invest in, such as the industry or sector. Other potential factors in choosing dividend stocks may include market capitalization, a company\u2019s relative risk (using a stock\u2019s Beta may be a helpful tool for this\u2014see this article on how to use beta to calculate a stock\u2019s risk), and the technical position of the stock using price charts and technical analysis with a larger focus on the medium and long term prospects for the stock. Step 4: Monitor your stocks. Monitoring dividend stocks is similar to monitoring any other stock positions. You want to see the overall performance of the stocks, including how the various sectors and industries you have exposure to in your portfolio are doing. In addition to monitoring this overall exposure on the stocks\u2019 overall performance, you should also look to see that dividends continue to be paid, and ideally that the dividends are increasing. Another part of monitoring dividend stocks is assessing the company\u2019s ability to continue to pay dividends with company earnings, and not by using cash and other resources just to maintain the dividend. This analysis relates to the quality of earnings, the debt-to-equity ratio, and other fundamental analysis. Step 5: Receive your dividends. Dividends on stocks are typically paid quarterly. There are four dates relating to dividend payments: the declaration date, the ex-dividend date, the record date, and the payable date. The declaration date states the amount of the dividend payment, as well as the ex-dividend and payable dates. The ex-dividend date is the first date of trading on the stock where the dividend will not be paid to the owner of the stock. The record date is the trading day after the ex-dividend date and represents the owners of the stock that will receive the dividend. Finally, the payable date is the day the dividend payment is actually made to stockholders. Similar to other stock trading accounts, brokers require certain personal information to open a dividend stock account. This information includes name, Social Security number (or taxpayer ID number), address, email address, date of birth, and a government ID (such as a license or passport). Brokers will also require personal financial information, such as net worth and income, under the Know Your Client (KYC) rules to determine whether opening a trading account is appropriate for you. Opening a trading account for the purpose of wealth-building and obtaining income are conservative reasons to open an account, and are usually approved if the personal information is in proper order. Dividend investment options include individual stocks, high-yield mutual funds and ETFs, and dividend-appreciation funds and ETFs. All of these investment types entail the purchase of dividend-paying stocks, but mutual funds and ETFs are investment vehicles that purchase multiple dividend stocks on behalf of their\u00a0 investors. Investing in individual companies that pay a dividend is the most direct way to gain access to dividend-paying stocks in a portfolio. In this instance, the investor creates a portfolio of different companies that pay a dividend by performing their own research and making their own decisions on which stocks to hold in their portfolio. This method does not typically involve any additional expenses, especially as most online brokers provide commission-free stock trading. The investor is responsible for all of the investment decisions, however, so must\u00a0 do their homework and continuously monitor their positions. High-yield mutual funds and ETFs are managed funds that select high-yielding dividend stocks on behalf of their investors. With these funds, the investor does not have to choose the individual dividend stocks for their portfolio, but they still get the dividend payments in the form of cash or by reinvesting the dividends in additional shares of the mutual fund or ETF. While most of these funds pay dividends on a quarterly basis, some do so on a monthly schedule. There are fees associated with these funds, which impact the overall performance of these funds, so the investor will have to evaluate whether the fees are worth paying relative to overall performance and not having to choose and manage the dividend stocks they are investing in themselves. Dividend-appreciation funds and ETFs are similar to high-yield mutual funds and ETFs, but the dividend stocks the professional managers choose for these portfolios will consist of dividend stocks that have consistently increased their dividends over several quarters. Like high-yield mutual funds and ETFs, investors need to take the funds\u2019 fees into consideration when choosing a fund. Fees: Fees are an important factor in any trading account, as fees impact the overall returns on an investment account. Fortunately for those trading individual dividend stocks, most brokers have moved to a commission-free model, so there is no cost. Commissions on individual stock trading are also very low for those trading in commission accounts, but most dividend investors are likely to choose a no-commission broker for purchasing individual dividend stocks. Investors choosing to gain exposure to dividend stocks though mutual funds or ETFs should look at the fees and expense ratios charged by those funds, which will impact overall returns. Fees on ETFs are typically lower than on mutual funds. Account minimums: The majority of online brokers no longer have account minimums, although some mutual fund companies have minimum investment amounts when investing directly through them. However, investors can gain access to many dividend mutual funds and ETFs directly through one of the many commission-free online brokers. Research and trading tools: Research on dividend stocks is an important factor in deciding on which stocks to add to a portfolio, so it is helpful to use a broker that offers a good stock screener, as well as good fundamental and technical information for researching companies and industries. As for trading tools, having the ability to use conditional orders to manage trading positions for profit and loss management, and the ability trade and monitor positions directly from a price chart, are nice-to-have features, but less critical since dividend investing typically involves more of a buy and hold, and much less active, trading style. This article explores the pros and cons of a passive buy and hold strategy. Customer service: With any broker, good customer service is a nice thing to have. While choosing and investing in dividend stocks and funds is a pretty straightforward endeavor, those newer to investing may particularly benefit from responsive customer service that can help them learn how to use stock screeners, make decisions on automatic reinvestment options, and execute trades. Some brokers offer live chat services in addition to customer service by phone, and there is a difference between brokers on their response times. Security: Account security, including features such as two-factor authentication, is important to ensure the safety of your trading account. In addition, while most brokers have Securities Investor Protection Company (SIPC) protection on accounts, some brokers offer additional account protection\u2014typically through excess coverage beyond SIPC protection through Lloyd\u2019s of London insurance policies backing the broker\u2014that might be an important consideration for investors with accounts exceeding SIPC coverage limits. Both qualified and unqualified dividends are included on a tax return, but they are treated differently for tax purposes. Ordinary dividends are the most common dividend paid by stocks and mutual funds that invest in stocks, and represent payments to the stockholder from a company\u2019s earnings and profits. Ordinary dividends can be either qualified or unqualified. Unqualified dividends include dividends from regular dividend-paying stocks that are not held by the investor for a certain required holding period, as well as dividends from most real estate investment trusts (REITs), employee stock option plans, tax-exempt companies, and mutual funds that invest in fixed income products (including money market mutual funds). The holding period for a stock dividend to be a qualified dividend, for an otherwise qualifying stock, is 61 or more days out of the 121 day period that starts 60 days before the stock\u2019s ex-dividend date (for preferred stocks, the holding period is 91 days out of the 181 day period starting 90 days before the ex-dividend date). Unqualified dividends are taxed as ordinary income at the tax filer\u2019s tax rate based on their overall income. Tax rates for qualified dividends are also based on the taxpayer\u2019s income, but are lower, in line with capital gains tax rates, which are currently either 0%, 15%, or 20%. For 2024, the breakpoints on qualified dividends for an individual tax filer are 0% up to $47,025 in taxable income, then 15% to $518,900, then 20%. For those married and filing jointly, the breakpoints are 0% up to $94,050, then 15% to $583,750, then 20%, so there is a marriage penalty on qualified dividend taxation for those married and filing jointly if their combined income is more than $583,750. A dividend stock is an individual stock, while a dividend fund is a mutual fund or ETF that invests in multiple dividend-paying stocks. Investors in dividend funds can choose to reinvest dividends for more shares of the fund or ETF or simply take the dividends as an income stream. Holders of individual dividend stocks can take their dividends as an income stream or may have the option to participate in a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) that automatically reinvests dividends for additional shares of the individual dividend-paying stock. Like with any stock, dividend stocks are impacted by the overall rise and fall of the markets, making them vulnerable to periods of volatility. But as a whole, these stocks have a tendency to be less volatile than non-dividend stocks. In part, this is because investors in dividend stocks have a tendency to be buy-and-hold investors looking for passive income, rather than very active traders. Other criteria that can be helpful to screen for includes companies with strong cash flow, long-term earnings between 5% and 15%, and low debt-to-equity ratios. Any investor looking to accumulate wealth over the long term should consider including dividend stocks as part of their overall portfolio. Investing in dividend stocks has long been adopted as a solid method for building wealth over long periods of time, and dividend investing will likely continue to be used for this purpose because it offers passive income and compounds over time, and also provides a hedge against inflation more effectively than bonds.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn how to open an IRA and start a retirement fund for your future financial well-being Whether you are just starting out or midway into your career, understanding how to open the best IRA account and fund it will propel you onto the path to true financial security. Anyone with earned income who meets the eligibility requirements can open an individual retirement account (IRA). Money within the IRA account grows tax-free. We\u2019ll take you step by step through the process of how to open a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA. You\u2019ll discover the IRA requirements, how much it costs to open an IRA, and how long it takes. Finally, you\u2019ll learn where to open an IRA and whether to choose a Roth or traditional IRA account. Investopedia / Jake Shi The first step in setting up an IRA is to decide whether you prefer a self-directed IRA or an IRA that is managed through a robo-advisor. Then, you\u2019ll explore which financial firm is best for you. Finally, you\u2019ll determine whether it\u2019s better to open a Roth or traditional IRA account. Step 1: Choose between an online broker and a robo-advisor. Choosing an online broker or a robo-advisor depends upon whether you want to select your own investments or desire a digital investment platform that considers your preferences and makes the final investment decision for you. With an online broker like Fidelity, Charles Schwab, or Merrill Edge, you can pick and choose from a menu of investment assets. Although there will be customer service representatives available to help with setup and questions, if you open an IRA at an online broker, you\u2019ll be responsible for selecting the investments for your Roth, traditional, or rollover IRA. That will involve picking stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If you are confident in your ability to pick your own investments, or if you are committed to learning the investing basics, then consider opening your IRA with an online broker. If you aren\u2019t investment-savvy or interested in studying investing strategies, then you might choose an IRA at a robo-advisor platform. Robo-advisors are algorithm-driven digital investment advisors that select and manage your investments for you based on your financial goals, time frame, and risk tolerance. You can choose to open a robo-advisor IRA at a stand-alone platform like Wealthfront or Betterment or select a robo-managed by a financial firm like Schwab Intelligent Portfolios or Fidelity Go. Step 2: Decide where to open an IRA. Once you\u2019ve decided whether to do it yourself or go with a managed robo-advisory IRA, you\u2019ll need to select which financial firm is the best fit for you. If you like the idea of having all of your finances under one roof, then you might choose an investment advisor that offers both self-directed investing and robo-advisory options. When deciding where to open an IRA, investigate annual IRA management fees, investment minimums, available investments, customer service options, and customer reviews. After making your selection, you\u2019ll gather the information needed to open the account. Step 3: Choose an IRA account type to invest in. Next, choose the type of IRA that best fits your tax and financial situation. Understand that Roth and traditional IRAs have eligibility limits, depending on your income and whether you have a workplace retirement account. Both the Roth and traditional IRA have their own characteristics. We\u2019ll cover two individual IRAs and two workplace IRAs for self-employed individuals. Types of IRA Accounts Step 4: Open an account. Opening an IRA account involves proving that you are who you say you are by providing personal documentation to support your identity. You\u2019ll need personal and financial information to open an account. Every website has an online option to \u201copen an account\u201d which you can select. Then you\u2019ll be asked a series of demographic and financial questions. Below, we discuss the documents that you\u2019ll need to open the IRA account online or in person. Step 5: Fund your account. To fund the account, you\u2019ll link an existing financial account with the newly opened IRA. On your bank's website, navigate to the external transfer vertical. Input the requested information about the newly opened IRA. After leaving an employer, many individuals prefer to roll retirement contributions from a 401(k) or 403(b) plan into an IRA. Or you might want to roll over an IRA from one custodian to another. As long as you perform a trustee-to-trustee rollover, you won\u2019t owe any taxes. Each financial institution has its own process for completing an IRA rollover, so it\u2019s best to call customer service at your existing retirement plan and request rollover instructions. If you withdraw the funds via check or transfer into an existing bank account, you have 60 days to reinvest the money into the IRA, without paying taxes. If you don\u2019t contribute the funds to the IRA within 60 days, you might owe taxes and/or penalties. When funding your IRA with money from an existing bank or brokerage account, visit the transfer section of your financial institution's website. Select the \u201cexternal transfer\u201d option and provide information about the IRA account when requested. You\u2019ll have the option to make a one-time transfer to fund the IRA account or to set up regular auto-transfers from the funding account into the IRA. Individuals are limited in the amount they can contribute to an IRA, and certain income levels determine who can open an IRA. Here are the IRA contribution limits for 2024: The SECURE ACT (Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act) of 2019 was signed into law on December 20, 2019. The legislation removed the former rule that you had to be under the age of 70\u00bd in order to contribute to a traditional IRA. Under the SECURE Act, anyone, regardless of age, can contribute to a traditional IRA as long as they have earned income. The information you need to open an IRA account is similar to opening a taxable brokerage account. Although the process is similar across platforms, each IRA custodian may have a distinct process for opening an IRA online. Detailed personal information is required to open an IRA online or in person, to prove that you are who you claim to be. Before you open the IRA, compile all of the required documentation. You\u2019ll need to consider how you\u2019ll fund the IRA as well as the beneficiary of the account. After opening the IRA, provide your banking information to the IRA custodian. This will facilitate cash transfers from your financial institution into the IRA account. You\u2019ll also need to set up external or internal transfers at your bank to fund the IRA account. It\u2019s easy to access your banking information from a blank check and your online bank statement. After opening the IRA account, you may want to set up an automatic transfer from your bank into the IRA account. To fund the account, you\u2019ll need the following banking information: Consider if an IRA is right for you by reviewing the pros and cons. An individual retirement account, or IRA, allows individuals with earned income to save and invest for retirement. While in the IRA account, your money is invested for retirement and grows tax-free or tax-deferred. There are three types of IRAs: Traditional, Roth, and rollover. The three types of IRAs, traditional, Roth, and rollover, all work similarly. If you have employment income, you transfer a portion of that income, up to the IRA contribution limit, into your account. Once the money is in the account, you determine how to invest it. You can choose individual stocks, bonds, and/or funds. The money will grow tax-free or tax-deferred until you withdraw it, at which time you might owe income taxes. Traditional IRAs are invested with pre-tax dollars, and thus you\u2019ll owe taxes on the withdrawal. Roth IRAs are invested with after-tax dollars and can be withdrawn tax-free. You\u2019re eligible to withdraw your funds penalty-free at age 59\u00bd or later. In most cases, if you withdraw the money before that age, you\u2019ll be liable for a 10% penalty plus income taxes, although there are a few exceptions to this rule. You can withdraw your principal Roth IRA contribution at any time after a five-year holding period. Here are the rules for how much you need to open an IRA: If you have earned income, then the minimum amount you need is determined by where you open your account.\u00a0 You can\u2019t exceed the maximum amount set by the IRS, or determined by your earned income. The best IRA to open requires some projections. If you believe that your future tax rate in retirement will be lower than your current tax rate, then you might prefer a traditional IRA. With a traditional IRA, you don\u2019t pay income tax on the money you contribute to the IRA until it is withdrawn in retirement. At age 73, you\u2019re required to begin the required minimum distributions (RMD) from the IRA. The Roth IRA decision is a bit more complicated. If you are in a low-ish tax bracket now and prefer to pay income taxes now, rather than in retirement, then a Roth IRA might be the best. With the Roth, you pay tax only once, when the money is earned and before investing in the account. Then your Roth IRA contribution grows tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free as well. Unlike the traditional IRA, you are not required to withdraw money from the Roth in retirement. Ideally, if you\u2019re seeking a healthy sum in retirement, you\u2019ll invest the maximum amount in the IRA annually. If you\u2019re under the age of 50, that\u2019s $583.33 per month, which equates to $7,000 per year. Those over the age of 50 can invest $666.67 per month or $8,000 per year. If you can\u2019t swing the maximum, then invest as much as you can afford. You can always increase your IRA contributions later. The risks of IRAs include: The concept of asset allocation can inform the best types of investments for traditional and Roth IRAs. Taxable bonds, bond ETFs, REITs, and tax-inefficient investments with relatively high current tax obligations might be best for a traditional IRA. Consider fast-growing stocks and growth stock funds for your Roth account, as you\u2019ll eliminate a big capital gains tax bill when you sell the equities. There\u2019s no limit on the number of IRA accounts you may have. However, the total of all annual IRA contributions cannot exceed the entire $7,000 maximum contribution level (or $8,000 for those over age 50). Just because you can have multiple IRA accounts doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a good idea to have more than two\u2014a traditional and a Roth IRA. The more investment accounts you have, the more difficult it is to manage and keep track of your financial assets. The best place to open an IRA is a personal decision. Most major brokerage accounts offer a full range of investments, strong customer service, and low or no annual management fees. Robinhood offers a match for IRA contributions, which might be enticing for some. If you have an existing banking or brokerage account, you might prefer to open an IRA at the same financial firm and maintain all accounts under one roof. If you\u2019re considering a robo-advisor, investigate fees, investment management, and customer service options to select the best place to open an IRA, for you.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn what it takes to buy fractional shares on Webull ArtistGNDphotography / Getty Images If you are looking to start investing in the market but don\u2019t feel like you have enough money to buy enough shares to fully diversify your portfolio, fractional shares are a great solution. This strategy allows you to invest in stocks based on a specific dollar amount rather than buying a specific number of shares. This allows you to diversify your funds and start investing at a lower threshold. Buying fractional shares on Webull\u2019s platform is streamlined and easy. You simply open and fund an account to access fractional shares from an approved list of thousands of stocks and ETFs. We\u2019ll take an in-depth look at how to buy fractional shares through Webull and cover the basics to help you decide if fractional share trading is the right fit for your portfolio needs. Buying fractional shares on Webull is a very simple process. To open an account, you have to provide some basic personal information as well as details on your employment, financial status, and what type of securities you want to invest in. Once the application has been filled out, most investors will receive an email with account approval within minutes. Once the account has been approved, you merely need to fund the account and you will be ready to start investing. Step 1: Open a Webull account. Opening an account with Webull is straightforward. Users can sign up using their phone number and verification code, or sign up using their Facebook or Google profile. You will then have the option to select \u201copen an account.\u201d Next you will be asked to verify your identity by uploading a photo of your driver\u2019s license or another form of identification. From there, you will enter in your basic personal information, employment information, financial information, and the type of account you want to open. Once all this is filled out, you will enter your email address for verification of account application approval. When you receive the email letting you know your account is approved, you are ready to fund your account and start investing. You can fund the account via an ACH transfer with a linked bank account using the \u201cmake your first deposit\u201d button. It is important to note that you can choose between a cash account and a margin account. With the cash account, you can purchase stocks with whatever funds you deposit. A margin account requires an account balance above $2,000 and unlocks the ability to use leverage beyond your balance to increase your buying power. Step 2: Log in to your Webull account. Once you have opened a Webull account, you can login and search for the stock or exchange traded fund (ETF) that you\u2019d like to buy fractional shares of. If fractional share trading is available for that particular stock, there will be a green diamond icon on the stock. Step 3: Click the \u201cTrade\u201d tab. After deciding on the stock that you\u2019d like to buy and determining that it can be traded in fractional shares, you will click the \u201ctrade\u201d button at the bottom of your screen. From there, switch the order type to \u201cmarket,\u201d as fractional share trading at Webull can only take place currently as a market order during market hours. Step 4: Change setting from \u201cShares\u201d to \u201cDollars.\u201d You will then need to change the setting from \u201cshare\u201d to \u201cUSD\u201d in order to buy fractional shares. Enter the dollar amount that you\u2019d like to invest and review all order information for accuracy. Step 5: Submit your order. Once you have verified your order information, click the \u201cbuy\u201d button at the bottom of the screen to place your order. You will want to carefully review your order before clicking the \u201cbuy\u201d button because once an order is placed, Webull does not have the option to modify an open order. To open your new account at Webull, you will need to provide your basic personal and financial information. When opening your account online, you will be asked to provide personal and contact information: In addition to providing your personal information, you will be asked to provide your employment and basic financial information. After your account application has been approved, you will then have the option to fund your account via ACH transfer from your current U.S. bank account or wire transfer from U.S. or foreign banks (fees may apply for wire transfers). Unlike a full service brokerage, Webull does not ask you about your financial goals or long-term financial planning. The platform currently offered is transactional in nature only. If you are looking for a low-cost, no-commission platform that is easy to use for placing trades, Webull is a good option. However, if you are looking for a more comprehensive platform\u2013offering account consolidation, goal planning, or research\u2013you may need to look elsewhere. The most obvious benefit of opening an account and trading fractional shares at Webull is the speed of the process. You can literally open an account within minutes and start trading. Webull offers thousands of U.S. stocks and ETFs for fractional share trading. However, you can really only determine which stocks and ETFs are currently on the list by searching in your account dashboard and seeing if the green diamond icon that indicates fractional share availability is by the stock or ETF. In terms of the quality of the trading platform, Webull offers a decent selection of charting tools and a basic stock screener. Webull may not be as full-featured as larger brokers, but for a streamlined, no-fee brokerage, it is more than adequate for fundamental stock research and basic technical analysis. Webull also offers access to other assets, including options that will appeal to more active traders. Another differentiating factor is that Webull offers margin trading. Because of the volatility of the market and the fact that trading on margin is actually borrowing money from Webull that you must pay back with interest, this option may be best suited for a more seasoned investor. It is important to remember that when investing using a margin account that you will still have to pay back the original amount borrowed plus interest even if the stocks lose value. All that said, buying fractional shares with a cash account is quick and easy, and funding your Webull account can be done via either ACH funds transfer or wire transfer. Selection of stocks and ETFs available for fractional share investing: Webull offers thousands of stocks and ETFs for fractional share investing. However, in order to find which stocks or ETFs are approved, you must search the specific stock from your Webull account dashboard and look for the green diamond icon to determine if the stock can be traded in fractional shares or not. Fees and commissions: Getting started at Webull is simple with $0 commissions for online U.S. stock and ETF trades. There are also no account management fees or inactivity fees to buy and sell fractional shares. Account minimums: Investors at Webull can buy fractional shares for as low as $5; there is no minimum to open an account. Research amenities: Once you open an account with Webull, you will have access to limited research amenities from your account dashboard. Investors can go to the \u201cmarkets\u201d tab and search any stock or ETF to see the current market price and basic information. The \u201cnews\u201d tab is another resource that compiles articles from multiple sources across the internet on trending financial topics. Educational content: The educational content provided by Webull is basic information on how to invest, what investment products the brokerage offers, and how to use the Webull app. Investors can access this library of videos from the \u201clearn\u201d tab. Fractional shares allow investors to buy a fraction, or portion, of a whole share of a stock. Investing in fractional shares helps you to easily diversify your portfolio and invest in companies that you may otherwise not be able to easily buy shares of. For instance, if you want to invest in a company, but the stock price is $100 per share, you don\u2019t need to have $100 to buy a full share. At Webull, you can invest in this company for as little as $5. In this case, your stake in the company will be 0.05 of a full share (5/100). With this strategy, you are investing based on a specific dollar amount that you set, not an individual stock\u2019s price or a certain number of shares. Buying fractional shares provides investors with a lower entry point of accessibility, thereby allowing themto gain market entry sooner into expensive stocks. Moreover, with fractional shares of ETFs, investors can diversify their portfolio at smaller account values than would otherwise be possible. Webull, founded in 2017, is a Chinese-owned company headquartered in New York. Webull is a discount broker that offers limited services and a straightforward, no-frills platform. Offering commission-free trades, no fees, and no account minimum requirements, Webull has positioned itself to serve newer and more active traders. Currently, the company offers standard brokerage accounts, which provide the choice to invest in: Fractional share trading is currently offered on thousands of stocks and ETFs at Webull, but it is only available for the latest version of the mobile app. Keep in mind that only stocks and ETFs from an approved list are available for fractional share trading, so while you may want to invest in options or crypto, that cannot be done fractionally at this time. Investing in fractional shares is a good way to dollar-cost average your money into the market. When utilizing this strategy on a regular basis, you will be buying fractions of several stocks over the course of time, which will accumulate into a portfolio that includes full shares of multiple stocks. Buying shares of a stock over time reduces the effect of market timing where you may be paying a premium or getting a discount on a transaction based on market factors. Lowering the total cost paid for an asset can make you money, provided that the asset appreciates over time. Over time, diversified portfolios are more likely than not to appreciate. Webull is not the only option when it comes to fractional share trading. Charles Schwab is an excellent online platform to buy fractional shares of stocks. Investors can choose from any stock listed on the approved list of S&P 500 stocks for an investment as low as $5. Schwab also allows investors to choose up to 30 \u201cslices\u201d each time they place an order, so diversifying your portfolio is quite easy to do. As many options as investors have when buying fractional shares at Charles Schwab, ETFs are one product that is not currently available. Webull offers fractional shares on select ETFs, as do other Schwab competitors like Fidelity. Not owning a full share of a company can make it more complicated when you want to sell it. Webull offers investors fractional share trading as market orders only. When selling, there is a minimum of 0.00001 shares per order for closing fractional share positions. It is also noted on the website that \u201cthe rule of $5 minimum doesn't work for closing fractional share positions.\u201d Fractional shares are not able to be transferred, so any fractional share would need to be sold prior to a transfer taking place.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. When you hold uninvested cash in your brokerage account, this is money that\u2019s not earning a return in the market. This can feel like a wasted opportunity, especially at a time when banks are paying some of the highest interest rates in over a decade. Fortunately, some investment platforms offer features where your uninvested cash earns interest. The broker itself doesn\u2019t pay interest. Instead, it puts idle cash from investors into an FDIC-insured bank account. This system, known as a cash sweep program, can allow you to still earn a decent interest rate while keeping your money available to invest. Ideally, a sweep program is convenient, doesn\u2019t charge you a fee, and has simple account requirements. If you expect to hold uninvested cash, here are the best investment accounts worth considering. Betterment will now match 1% of your net Roth and traditional IRA contributions until December 30, 2024. Terms apply. Get started today. If you\u2019d like help with your portfolio, Betterment is a robo-advisor that takes care of the investment decisions for you. You simply pick a type of portfolio strategy, then Betterment\u2019s robo-advisor will build a portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets to meet these goals. In exchange, it charges a flat fee: $4 per month or 0.25% of accounts worth at least $20,000. This is considerably less than the 1% or more per year charged by a human advisor. To go with its robo-advisor, Betterment offers a high-yield cash account called Cash Reserve. The Cash Reserve account earns a very high annual percentage yield (APY) of 4.25% APY on all balances, as of November 2024. There\u2019s no minimum balance required to earn interest and the rate applies to all accounts, and your balance receives FDIC insurance up to $2 million. Once you\u2019re ready to invest, you can then transfer the cash to your Betterment portfolios. Alternatively, Betterment offers a no-fee checking account. You could transfer cash to this account to spend on a debit card or make ATM withdrawals. However, it doesn\u2019t earn interest like the Cash Reserve account. Pays an excellent cash interest rate No account minimum to earn interest Robo-advisor automatically manages investments Good selection of investment portfolios Easy-to-use accounts No investment options beyond the robo-advisor Portfolios only use ETFs as investments Doesn\u2019t allow margin trading No weekend live customer service Interactive Brokers Interactive Brokers is one of the best options for serious traders and investors. Its platform offers a wide range of investment technology, advanced research, and access to over 150 markets. Interactive Brokers offers commission-free trading for stocks and ETFs through its IBKR Lite program. It does charge low commissions for its more advanced IBKR Pro platform in exchange for more trading capabilities and better order execution. Interactive Brokers offers a program for uninvested cash that should be highly appealing for serious investors. As of November 2024, it pays an interest rate of 3.08% for IBKR Lite accounts and 4.08% for IBKR Pro accounts on balances above $10,000. As rates change over time, IBKR Lite accounts earn one percentage point less than IBKR Pro. You don\u2019t need to opt in to earn interest. However, you can join an additional sweep program to get more FDIC insurance on your cash balance: $2.5 million of coverage on top of the normal SIPC coverage of $250,000. The drawback with Interactive Brokers is you need a large account balance to earn its best rate. If your total brokerage account balance is over $100,000, you earn interest on all your uninvested cash. However, if your account value is less than $100,000, Interactive Brokers will not pay interest on your first $10,000 of uninvested cash. On an $11,000 cash balance, only $1,000 would earn interest. High interest rate on uninvested cash Powerful, customizable brokerage platform Superior order execution Vast range of markets and investment options Low margin rates Restricts interest payments for accounts less than $100,000 Platform can be overwhelming to learn Complicated fee structure Charges commissions for IBKR Pro trades SmartRouting not available for IBKR Lite accounts Wealthfront Wealthfront is another highly rated robo-advisor. Its platform can automatically build you a portfolio using funds with US stocks, foreign stocks, bonds, and real estate. You start by answering a few questions about your investment goals, and the robo-advisor goes to work to build you a suitable portfolio. You can also make zero-commission trades in stocks with Wealthfront. As of November 2024, Wealthfront\u2019s Cash Account pays a highly competitive APY of\u00a04.25%. The high interest rate applies to all your uninvested cash. There is no minimum or maximum balance. You just deposit cash and earn interest until you\u2019re ready to invest. Your cash receives up to $8 million in FDIC insurance (and $16 million for joint accounts) thanks to the banks Wealthfront works with. There are no account fees or restrictions for the Cash Account. You can transfer money in and out as often as you want. You also receive a debit card to make purchases. Excellent interest rate for uninvested cash No fees or account requirements for earning interest Good range of robo-advisor investment options Offers free financial planning tools Automatic, daily tax-loss harvesting No human advisors available Limited investments besides stocks and the robo-advisor Limited chat and customer service No fee reduction or extra support for larger accounts Empower combines the technology and convenience of a robo-advisor with the support of traditional financial advisors. Its platform offers ongoing portfolio allocation recommendations, rebalancing, tax optimization, and unlimited access to speak with a human advisor. To use this service, though, you need an account balance of at least $100,000. If you invest on your own, Empower\u2019s investment accounts do not have an initial balance requirement. Empower\u2019s Personal Cash account also does not have a minimum account balance requirement. As of November 2024, the account earns a high APY of 4.00%, and there are no balance requirements or fees to earn this interest rate. However, you do need to transfer your cash out of any Empower investment account into the cash account to earn interest; it doesn\u2019t happen automatically. Empower offers aggregate FDIC insurance up to $5 million on your balance. While you can transfer money out of the cash account as often as you want, Empower does set a daily withdrawal limit of $100,000. To help manage your money, you can access Empower\u2019s free financial planning tools like its budget planner and net-worth calculator. High interest rate on cash account No account minimum required for interest Combines a robo-advisor with human planners Good selection of investment strategies and portfolios Free online money management tools $100,000 account minimum for robo-advisor Must transfer money to cash account for interest Higher fees versus other robo-advisors Must call\u00a0to set up an account Mobile app missing some desktop functionalities Fidelity is one of the largest investment brokers in the world thanks to its commitment to low-cost investing. It does not require a minimum account balance, charges no fees or commissions on stock and ETF trades, and has low administrative fees. Its platform is user-friendly for beginners, yet offers plenty of screeners, portfolio analysis tools, and other features for serious investors. For this reason, it ranked as the best overall broker in our review of Best Online Brokers and Trading Platforms. Fidelity\u2019s program for uninvested cash is also simple and competitive, offering 4.32% on uninvested cash through a sweep into money market funds. Fidelity's cash management program operates more like a bank account, offering bill pay, an ATM card, and mobile check deposit. The cash management program earns an APY of 2.35%, as of November 2024. If you have both types of Fidelity accounts, you can transfer cash back and forth. Automatically pays a high interest rate on cash All sized accounts earn interest Low costs and trading commissions User-friendly, powerful investment platform High quality research tools and educational materials Charges fees for international stock and currency trades No commodities or futures trading High fees for broker-assisted trades Above-average fees for options Robinhood When it first hit the scene, Robinhood made a big splash in the investment world. Robinhood\u2019s app made investing incredibly easy\u2014some might say even too easy. Robinhood\u2019s trading app offers zero-commission trades for stocks, ETFs, options, and cryptocurrencies. Its investment research tools are a little limited compared to major desktop platforms, but are enough for casual investors. Robinhood does have a competitive program for uninvested cash, but there\u2019s a catch. You must have a Robinhood Gold account to qualify for its highly advertised rate. Robinhood Gold offers premium features like Morningstar research, a larger limit for instant deposits, and lower rates for margin investing at a cost of $5 per month. If you pay for Robinhood Gold, you earn 4.25% on all your uninvested cash. However, if you just have a free Robinhood account, you only earn 0.1%. Whether the $5 monthly fee is worth it depends on the size of your cash balance and whether you want the other Gold benefits. To use Robinhood\u2019s program, you must opt in to use cash sweep on the app. This makes you eligible to earn interest and increases the FDIC coverage of your cash balance to $2.25 million. There\u2019s no minimum or maximum balance requirement to earn interest. High interest rate for Robinhood Gold users Zero commission trades App is very easy to use Fractional share trading available No minimum balance requirements Must pay $5 monthly for Robinhood Gold for highest APY Free accounts earn a moderate interest rate Only basic research tools Limited asset selection When evaluating investment accounts for uninvested cash, accessibility is crucial to ensuring that investors can easily access their cash when needed without facing unnecessary restrictions or penalties. Additionally, safety is paramount, with investors seeking accounts that offer FDIC insurance to safeguard their uninvested cash against the loss of their deposits in an FDIC-insured bank or savings association that fails. The APY earned is another critical consideration, as investors aim to maximize the return on their uninvested cash while maintaining liquidity and safety.\u00a0Moreover, investors should also assess any associated fees or account minimums when comparing investment accounts for uninvested cash. Minimizing fees and meeting any required minimum balances can help investors optimize their cash management strategy and maximize the return on their uninvested cash. By prioritizing liquidity, safety, yield, and cost-effectiveness, investors can select an investment account that aligns with their cash management needs and helps them achieve their financial goals effectively. - Amrut Deshmukh, Investopedia Research Analyst All the brokers on this list offer excellent programs for uninvested cash, assuming you can qualify for the best rates. The right fit depends on your investment goals as well as expected account balance. Interactive Brokers makes sense for serious investors who want the most investment capabilities, but it is actually Fidelity with the highest interest rate and an amazing platform of its own. Betterment and Wealthfront are both solid if you want a robo-advisor. They are quite similar and the right fit depends on which platform you prefer. Empower\u2019s cash account is also very good. There\u2019s no minimum account balance to use it, plus you get access to free financial planning tools. However, you need $100,000 to invest through Empower\u2019s robo-advisor. Last, Robinhood\u2019s program is very competitive if you\u2019re willing to pay $5 monthly for Robinhood Gold. Otherwise, its rate is mediocre compared to the others. Outside of the brokerage accounts, the simplest way to earn interest on cash is by keeping it in a high-yield savings account or money market account. There are online banks paying interest rates far above what you would earn from the major brick-and-mortar banks. With savings and money market accounts, you also keep instant access to your cash. If you\u2019re willing to lock your money up temporarily, you could put it in a bank certificate of deposit (CD). These can pay a higher interest rate, but you need to keep the money in for a set number of months or years. If you withdraw it early, you must pay a penalty. Bonds are another option. They pay interest, but there can be a risk of nonpayment, like if the bond issuer goes bankrupt. Generally, the higher the bond risk, the higher the interest rate. Rating agencies give companies, governments, and other bond issuers a letter grade showing how safe they are. Savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs are a risk-free way to invest your cash. These accounts receive FDIC insurance up to $250,000 per depositor per bank. Even if the bank goes bankrupt, the government promises you\u2019ll get your money back. Cash in a brokerage account is also very safe as it is insured by the SIPC up to $250,000. U.S. government bonds are also considered risk-free because of the stability of the United States. The federal government promises to make these payments and return your principal. Treasuries, I-Bonds, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are a few possibilities. A fixed annuity is one more very safe option. These contracts pay a set interest rate, guaranteed by an insurance company. You do agree to keep the money in the annuity for a set number of years, though, or you\u2019ll owe a penalty for canceling. As of September 2024, the cash earnings interest rate on Robinhood was 0.1% APY for free accounts and 4.50% for Robinhood Gold accounts. You do need to pay $5 a month for Robinhood Gold to get the higher rate. The interest rates also change based on market conditions. To start earning interest on your Robinhood balance, you must enroll in its cash sweep program. Then the app automatically places your uninvested cash in banks to earn the high interest rate. This program gives you additional FDIC protection, insuring your balance up to $2.25 million for uninvested cash.

He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Yaroslav Olieinikov / Getty Images Adding commodities to a portfolio, either through physical ownership or investment brokers, provides diversification and can even offer a hedge against price exposure further up the value chain of certain industries. Energy products like oil, gas, and coal; agricultural products like corn, soy, canola, pork, and beef; and metals like gold, silver, copper, and platinum all have well understood market dynamics and relatively simple financial instruments to act as trading vehicles. Many commodities are priced according to the market demand and the need for further processing. In a world where many financial assets are derivatives, trackers, and derivatives of derivatives, with layers of market sentiment influencing their performance, commodities can offer a more direct experience. We will take a look at the major commodities and how you can use them to fit your investment needs. Investors can access commodities in a few different ways. Owning physical commodities mainly applies to precious metals. Gold and silver are two of the best-known commodities that are used as physical stores of value. Investors can purchase these metals formed into bullion, with standard size and purity. Bullion bars are the closest in value to the melt price (the market price for the metal if you melted it down). Owning precious metals in physical form comes with issues of storage, insurance, and liquidity. Commodities beyond precious metals have further storage issues in that the quantities are often larger and there is a shelf life, so they must be sold within a given timeframe. This is why most commodities investors do not pursue physical ownership. To trade physical commodities, you need to find a reputable dealer and, most likely, a storage facility for your holdings. Futures contracts are direct plays on commodity prices. Futures contracts are an agreement to buy or sell a specified amount of a commodity at a specified price and date in the future. Investors use leveraged margin accounts to allow them to take larger positions with their existing capital. In the vast majority of trades, the contracts are cash settled. This saves an investor from having to take delivery of hundreds of thousands of pounds of sugar or figure out how to market a thousand head of cattle. Opening an account to trade futures contracts will often require some additional paperwork to enable margin trading as well as a higher account minimum. The specific maintenance margin needed in an account varies with the value of the contract being traded. Individual securities related to commodity processing or production can be accessed through a regular brokerage account. You can find the companies using a stock screener and looking for basic materials or energy sector companies. Investors looking for commodity exposure through company shares generally have to gain some industry-specific knowledge to be successful. For example, extraction companies in mining and energy have well-developed systems for feasibility studies on reserves that, in turn, drive the stock value. Larger companies will have reserves in different parts of the world and in different stages of development, meaning the impact of any one feasibility study is not a big deal as long as overall operations are profitable. A smaller company, however, may experience heightened price volatility based on the findings of a single feasibility study. Products traded on exchanges include commodity-based mutual funds, ETFs, and exchange-traded notes, which can provide exposure to commodities. There are exchange-traded products that are specific to individual commodities. These pool investor funds to combine capital in a commodity pool. The actual mechanism for investment depends on what is outlined by the fund. The fund managers could buy futures, options on futures, shares in companies in the sector, or even purchase and store physical goods. Some funds are leveraged, meaning they are attempting to provide double or triple the price movement of the commodity they are tracking. This is why it is important to read the fund disclosures prior to investing to ensure the exposure being offered matches your investment needs. Commodities are considered an alternative investment along with things like real estate that don\u2019t trade in the conventional style of stocks and bonds. Within precious metals, however, there is a subcategory of alternative investments that are closer to collectibles than they are to investments. Bullion coins and jewelry have an aesthetic and historical value that generally sees them trade at a premium compared to the melt price of the metals they contain. While these are still physical investments that can appreciate in value, their prices are less connected to market prices. You can buy jewelry from stores and coins directly from the Mint or from dealers, but they are more of a collectible than they are a commodity investment. Opening a commodities investing account is the same process as opening a regular brokerage account. If you are just looking to invest in commodities through companies and funds, it literally is a regular brokerage account as these two investment classes do not require anything special. If you will be trading futures and options, however, you first need to confirm your broker provides these options. Then you will usually have to make some additional disclosures to ensure you understand the risks and have enough capital so that it will not be wiped out in a single trade. To open a brokerage account, you need to provide some personal and financial information and\u00a0 answer some basic questions. The personal and financial information includes: With online brokerages, the first step is usually to set up an account (email and password) with the broker and then provide these further details as part of the onboarding process. While there are many brokerage accounts with zero account minimums, enabling futures trading in a margin account will generally require that at least a few thousand dollars be held with the broker. Depending on the contracts you are looking to trade, the actual amount of capital required to trade will be more than whatever the minimum deposit is to enable the account. Both the initial margin and the maintenance margin for futures accounts may be influenced by the account type (individual retirement account vs. non-IRA account). Gold individual retirement accounts (gold IRAs) are a type of commodity investing for retirement purposes. Unlike a regular IRA, you will have to find a custodian to hold the physical assets. You set up a gold IRA by first establishing a self-directed IRA, selecting a custodian to administer the account, selecting an approved depository to hold the gold, and then choosing a broker/dealer to buy the gold through. Some gold IRA providers have these services integrated or will refer clients to providers in their network. The documents and information required are the same as those for investment accounts: Minimum deposits for a gold IRA are high. This is partially owing to the fact that an ounce of gold is worth over $1000 and even smaller coins are worth several hundred dollars. The IRS rules state that only approved coins and bars of gold can be used for a gold IRA, but they do not set a minimum. While not all gold IRAs advertise a minimum, a practical amount would be at least $2000. Other gold IRAs have minimums of $10,000, $25,000, and even $60,000. Commodity investing, like any other type of investing, comes with advantages and disadvantages. Investors are attracted to commodity investing for its ability to provide an inflation hedge, diversify a portfolio, and unlock potentially large returns. The downsides to commodity investing are a lack of income, high volatility, and external risks. Commodities investing is not available through every broker. This is especially true for digital investment managers that limit their investing to ETFs and stocks. Larger brokers and trading-focused platforms generally do offer futures trading. This includes brokers like Schwab, Interactive Brokers, and E*TRADE, as well as more focused platforms like NinjaTrader and TradeStation. Below are the main factors to consider when opening an investment account for commodities trading. Customer support can vary widely between brokers. Most brokers still offer phone and email support, while some have added in-platform chat and social media channels for customers to reach them. A handful of brokers have gone the other way, with digital-only customer service offerings via FAQs and email contact forms. When it comes to customer service, you want to make sure the broker can be reached via your preferred method. Fees have become much more competitive for stocks and ETFs, with most brokers charging nothing at all. When it comes to futures, however, fees are calculated on a per-contract basis and can vary from mere cents to a few dollars. While the temptation is to find the lowest fee broker for futures, it is important to consider it in the context of the quality of the overall trading platform. While most brokers offer both ETFs and stocks, futures is more of a niche offering. If you are looking to invest in commodities, you are probably going to want access to the major futures exchanges unless you plan on solely working through ETFs. Generally speaking, you want to know that your broker is keeping your portfolio safe and has your best interests at heart. At a minimum, you want to see security protocols that are up to industry standards with two-factor authentication and plans in place to prevent outages and data breaches. Overall we like to see brokers with low minimum deposits to encourage people to invest. When it comes to futures, however, an investor should have a sizable amount of capital both to enable the margin account and ensure they can handle potential swings without devastating their portfolios. Commodities investing is definitely a risk capital activity and shouldn\u2019t make up the majority of your investment portfolio. Research tools can be important in helping you understand and visualize market dynamics when investing in commodities. Robust trading platforms can help by pulling quotes into charts and analyzing volume and volatility along with other important information like headlines and calendar events. Some brokers charge for extra data feeds, but this is another area where competition has lowered the overall costs. Commodities are the raw, or simplest, form of inputs that go into processing that turns them into energy, food, consumer products, and so on. Metals are an example of a commodity and encompasses a group of commodities with more complicated dynamics. Many metal commodities are well known. Gold is traded as a commodity and is often used as a hedge or safe haven against downturns in the financial markets. Silver has a similar hedge angle to it and shares some common traits with gold in terms of collectibility and jewelry, but it also has industrial applications that play a role in its demand. More common metals like copper see their demand rise with basic economic activity, as they are primarily destined for further applications in industry. Steel is also traded as a commodity even though it is a value-added form of iron. The many, many applications of steel make it a commodity in terms of the type of hedging and financial exposure market participants are looking for. Metals aren\u2019t the only commodities where the market holds different forms of the same input. Sugar, which is considered a soft commodity on account of being perishable, is traded as Sugar No. 11, Sugar No. 16, and White Sugar. Sugar No. 11 is the raw product benchmark with Sugar No. 16 having a market nuance in being meant for U.S. consumption, and White Sugar referring to the more refined product that goes into yet other products. Although many commodities travel the globe, like metals and sugar, the actual volume of trading will vary significantly and may also have seasonal trends. The volume on copper commodity contracts, for example, is often many times that of an agricultural soft commodity like soybean oil. Commodities that are less widely traded often require a bit more work to understand in terms of the market dynamics and pricing pressures, but acquiring this specialized knowledge can make a big difference for investors and traders looking to profit from the global trade of inputs. Commodities investing is simply adding exposure to commodities as an asset class. This could be directly, as with physical assets like gold or silver bullion, or through financial derivatives that trade on exchanges. Financial derivatives include options and futures, as well as commodity tracking funds and shares in companies that are directly involved in producing or processing a commodity. The main reasons for commodity investing are the potential for large returns, the inflation hedge, and the diversity it brings to a portfolio due to a low correlation with the rest of the financial markets. Some of the most widely traded commodities include: It is noteworthy that\u00a0 the actual volume of futures trading is now dominated by futures on financial assets rather than raw commodities. Equity index, interest rates, and currencies all generate more contract volume than agriculture, energy, or metals. Commodities are also traded by leveraged commodity funds that, in turn, trade as fund shares. These are often split into bull and bear funds, making it clear which market position they are taking. Unlike a direct futures or options position, an investor in a bear or bull fund is buying shares in the fund that is using its available capital to make direct and indirect trades related to the underlying commodity. For example, a leveraged fund can hold futures, options, shares, and other financial instruments like contracts for difference (CFD) with the goal of delivering some multiple of the reference indices performance. So a leveraged oil fund looking to provide two times West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI), for example, is aiming to give you two times whatever the change is in WTI short-term price.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn the various ways to buy fractional shares ArtistGNDphotography / Getty Imagea If you\u2019ve ever wanted to invest in a particular company\u2019s stock, but didn\u2019t have enough money to buy even one share, or you want to effectively diversify your funds, investing in fractional shares through online brokers or robo-advisors might be an affordable way to get started. Fractional shares allow investors to buy a portion, or fraction, of a stock based on a dollar amount that the investor can afford\u2013not based on a particular number of shares. Implementing this type of strategy is propitious for investors who may be starting out with a limited amount of money, but still want to build a diversified portfolio. We\u2019ll take an in-depth look at how investing in fractional shares works and answer the basic questions that investors need to know to get started. In order to buy fractional shares, you will need to open an investment account through either an online broker or a robo-advisor. The main difference between the two is whether you want to have full control over which fractional shares you are investing in, or if you want to have a more hands-off approach. With a robo-advisor, you will be able to set your dollar amount to invest and your investment goals, and based on that, the robo-advisor will choose your fractional share investments and automatically rebalance to keep you within your investment goal range. Step 1: Research the fractional shares you want to buy. Fractional share offerings will differ between brokerages, so knowing which stocks you want to be able to invest in via fractional shares can also help determine which brokerage you may want to use. Step 2: Open an online broker or robo-advisor account. Not all online brokers or robo-advisors offer fractional shares, so you will need to make sure the company you want to go with offers that service. It is also important to remember that every brokerage has slightly different nuances to the way they offer fractional shares, such as: Step 3: Fund the account. You will need to fund the account once you open it. Many online brokers can be funded via electronic funds transfer, but it still may take a few days for the funds to settle, so you may not be able to invest right away. Step 4: Complete and monitor your investment. Most online accounts make it very easy to monitor your portfolio using the main dashboard. Typically, you are able to see all of your account holdings at a glance, but you may also be able to utilize more advanced options, such as setting up stock alerts or automatic rebalancing, depending on what is offered by your particular online brokerage. While there are several benefits to investing in fractional shares, the following drawbacks are also worth considering: Limited stock selection: Just because a stock is publicly traded does not mean that you will be able to buy fractional shares of it. Each brokerage has its own curated list of stocks that investors can buy fractional shares of. Potential problems transferring fractional shares to a different broker: If you want to transfer your account to another brokerage, you may not be able to transfer the fractional shares. You may need to liquidate any fractional shares in order to transfer. Proxy voting may not be an option: Again, each firm also handles proxy voting differently regarding fractional shares. Make sure you know your company\u2019s policy on this ahead of time. Additional fees: Some brokerages charge additional fees for fractional share investing. This can potentially decrease profits, especially for low-dollar investment amounts. Find out if there are fees associated with fractional shares and if they are flat fees or a percentage. Trade execution may not take place in real time: If the brokerage that you are investing with does not settle your trade in real time, that could affect your cost basis. Some firms will settle all the fractional shares in one or more bulk orders rather than settling each order individually. Obviously, prices can fluctuate throughout a trading day, so understanding how this will be settled is important. Can complicate tax returns: Because you are buying fractional shares, and may buy several fractional shares throughout the year, depending on your investment strategy, you may end up holding several different tax lots that may be difficult to match up at tax time. If a stock you own has a dividend that you automatically reinvest, you will have additional tax lots to deal with. Selection of stocks and ETFs available for fractional share investing: Because each online brokerage has its own select list of stocks or ETFs that they offer for fractional share investing, it is important to know this ahead of time. Some firms will offer ETFs, others will not. One company may offer fractional shares of an individual company, while others may not. Be sure to check out each brokerage\u2019s list of fractional share stocks and ETF offerings before opening an account. Fees and commissions: Some brokerages will be commission-free when it comes to investing in fractional shares, while others may charge additional fees. It is important to find out the brokerage\u2019s policy on this prior to opening an account. Account minimums: Many companies have no account minimum to open or maintain the account. Often, investors can buy fractional shares for as low as $1. Balance and investment minimums will differ from broker to broker. Research amenities: Once you open an account with an online broker or robo-advisor, you will have access to research amenities. Brokers will provide analysts\u2019 assessments of companies, which can help you determine which stocks you\u2019d like to invest in. Educational content: Knowing how to invest, what to invest in, and how to reach your financial goals are important. Educational content provided by your brokerage can help you to better understand which investments will help you reach your goals, and even how to better utilize your account amenities to track and monitor your investment. Fractional shares are very simply a portion, or fraction, of a whole share. When investing in fractional shares, you will buy a portion of a stock share. With this strategy, you are investing based on a dollar amount, not an individual stock\u2019s price or a certain number of shares. Buying fractional shares provides investors with a lower entry point of accessibility, thereby allowing investors to gain market entry sooner. While the concept of trading in fractional shares has been around since 1999, the strategy really wasn\u2019t widely available\u2014or financially feasible\u2014until 2019. A few low-fee companies offered fractional shares at that time, but this didn\u2019t last very long. Around 2019, online brokers cut fees drastically to offer low fees or no monthly fees, thus creating a path for investing in fractional shares to become advantageous. Prior to 2019, your portfolio may have had fractional shares, but it was most likely due to a few, limited circumstances: owning mutual funds, stock splits, dividend reinvestment programs, or company mergers or acquisitions. Your experience with investing in fractional shares will differ depending on which brokerage you decide to invest through. Each brokerage has its own guidelines, so finding out exactly what is offered will be important before deciding to invest. For example: If you are only buying a fraction of a share, you will also only get a fraction of the dividend, if the stock receives one. For example, if you want to invest in a stock that is trading at $100 per share, you don\u2019t need to have $100 to buy a full share, you can instead invest $25 and own one-fourth of a share. If this same stock happens to get a dividend that is $0.40 per share, you would likewise get one-fourth of the dividend, or $0.10. One online brokerage that offers fractional shares is Charles Schwab. Schwab refers to a fractional share as a \u201cslice.\u201d When buying a Schwab stock slice, investors have the choice to buy slices of 30 stocks in companies on the S&P 500 in one transaction. These shares can then be held and sold independently. One way to think of it is like investing in a mutual fund, but you have the flexibility to trade the individual stocks, or stock fractions. Buying fractional shares can be beneficial in several ways: affordability, diversification, and dollar cost averaging. Affordability: You don\u2019t have to wait until you have hundreds or thousands of dollars in order to buy enough shares of a stock. You can start investing with many online brokerages in fractional shares with only $1. Diversification: Investing lower dollar amounts and being able to diversify used to only be available in mutual funds. However, now that many brokerages offer fractional shares, investors can choose which companies they want to invest in, and can trade the fractional shares at any time\u2014unlike a mutual fund, which is bought and sold as a \u201cbasket\u201d of stocks. Having the option to only invest in a fractional share allows investors to choose several stocks rather than putting all of their money into just one company in order to purchase a certain amount of whole shares. Dollar cost averaging: Because investing in fractional shares is an option, investors can choose to pick a specific dollar amount to invest each month, for instance. By investing on a regular basis, investors can take advantage of price fluctuations in the market while also hedging against risk. Yes, you can buy fractional shares through Fidelity. With a minimum account balance of $0, and fractional share investing starting at only $1, Fidelity makes it easy to open an account and start investing in fractional shares. In fact, Investopedia ranks Fidelity as the Best Online Broker for ETFs, so if investing in fractional shares of ETFs is important to you, this company may be a great option. In all, Fidelity offers over 7,000 US stocks and ETFs in which investors can buy fractional shares. Investing in such small dollar amounts may not seem like a way to make money. If you treat this like contributing to an IRA or 401k on a monthly basis, though, your multiple, small investments will add up over time and create a very nice savings account. While one individual purchase is only buying a portion of a stock, or portions of several stocks, investing over months or years will allow those fractional shares to keep building, potentially into several full shares of several stocks. Yes, some companies will offer ETFs as fractional shares. Because each brokerage has different fractional share offerings, it is important to find out if the firm you want to invest with offers ETFs as fractional shares and what other stocks are on its fractional share list. The answer to this will depend upon how your brokerage handles the selling of fractional shares. Some brokerage firms do not guarantee liquidity of fractional shares. This will differ from broker to broker, so it is something to consider when choosing which firm you want to invest with. Liquidity refers to the ability to easily sell a stock or security and convert to cash. Even though you can buy fractional shares, you may not be able to sell fractional portions as easily as whole shares.

Learn what it takes to automate your investing Automated investing might be the smartest way to simplify wealth-building. By automating your investing you\u2019re less likely to miss funds as they are withdrawn from your paycheck and\u00a0 transferred directly into your 401(k) or an investment account. From beginners to sophisticated options traders, automated investing is a crucial strategy to compound investment growth. We\u2019ve designed this guide to help you explore the ways to automate your investing from simply reinvesting dividends to regular transfers into a robo-advisor. It\u2019s usually quick and easy to automate your investing. Before setting up the account, review the platform\u2019s FAQ pages for the range of account minimums and potential approvals needed to open an automated investing account. Each platform will have its own process. Next, gather your bank account and personal information, such as your Social Security number. The investment account platform will walk you through the process step-by-step. Here\u2019s what you can expect when setting up your automated investing account: You can set up an automated investment plan in a variety of ways. From robo-advisors to your employer 401(k), we\u2019ll give you the rundown. Choose one or more automated investment types to ensure that you are converting today\u2019s earnings into wealth for tomorrow. First, find out what information is required to open an automated investing account. The personal information and documentation required to complete the onboarding process typically includes: Fortunately for investors, there are many automated investment accounts with low-minimum deposit requirements. Minimum deposits can range from zero for many well-known investment brokerage firms up to $100,000 for the comprehensive Empower robo-advisor, which also includes access to certified financial planners. If you are new to investing and just starting out, you might open your automated investing account at a major brokerage firm that doesn\u2019t require a minimum investment, such as Fidelity Go. Or, if you\u2019re seeking a robo-advisor with low minimums, SoFi Automated Investing, M1 Finance, Betterment, Ally, and Ellevest all require $100 or less to get started. With so many choices about how to automate investing, it can be confusing to narrow down your selection. To make the decision easier, evaluate these factors: Customer service: Phone customer service can be very important for both new and experienced investors. Be aware that some platforms do not offer live customer service. If talking to a human matters to you, then look into live customer service availability and contact times. Fees and commissions: Research from Vanguard and other firms has shown a direct correlation between lower fees and higher investment performance. Before investing with any platform, understand the fees you\u2019ll be paying, including management fees and fund expense ratios. Determine whether the services you\u2019re receiving are worth the fees. Account minimum: Investigate how much money you\u2019ll need to open the account as well as maintain it. Determine whether there is a minimum balance requirement and if it is suitable for your financial situation. Research tools: For self-directed investment accounts, carefully review the screeners, calculators, trading platforms, and research report availability. If you\u2019re a self-directed investor, make certain, before opening an account, that the research tools match up with your needs. Automated investing is a strategy to ensure that you regularly save and invest for the future. We all have the tendency to forget to implement our best intentions. New Year's resolutions are frequently forgotten by February. Automated investing pre-programs our behavior to put investing for the future first. Automated investing is best for anyone interested in converting today's earnings into tomorrow's prosperity. This strategy works when saving for retirement, a child's college education, general wealth-building, and saving for any goal that is more than five years in the future. The automated investment concept involves implementing a few simple steps. First, select a paycheck, personal checking, or savings account from which the investment funds will be drawn. Next, choose where you want to invest. The choices include your workplace retirement account, a self-directed investment account, a micro-investing app, or a robo-advisor. Reinvesting your dividends and capital gains within your brokerage account is also considered automated investing. Pick the specific investments, and then set up a regular transfer from the cash account into the investment account. Finally, you choose the amount and frequency of your auto investment strategy. Once the plan is enacted, your money will automatically transfer into the designated accounts and investments. That way, when markets go down, you\u2019ll be less tempted to stop investing, because the entire process is automated. In fact, when markets go down, you\u2019ll be set up to benefit from one of the best investment tenets: \u201cBuy low.\u201d Think of automated investing like automated bill pay. You set up the parameters, such as amount to be invested, the investment vehicles, and the funding method. After setup, regular transfers from your bank account or paycheck go directly to your investment accounts.\u00a0This automates the contributions to your investment account. If you have a self-directed account, you may have another step to them put that money to work. Often this can be eliminated if you are buying into pre-built portfolios offered by your brokerage. You can also automate the investment portfolio through a robo-advisor where the contributions will automatically be invested according to the allocations and rules that were created as part of your account setup. Automated investing is a good idea for nearly everyone. Behavioral finance research suggests that we are not always rational decision-makers. By helping you overcome less optimal investment behavior, such as irregular investing or avoiding investment, automated investing can improve your long-term financial success. Automated investing removes money from your account before you can spend it and diverts it into long-term financial assets, leading to wealth-building, Investing in financial markets is risky in that the value of your initial investment can decline. In fact, automated investing might be considered less risky than do-it-yourself investing. By regularly deploying money into the financial markets during both up and down markets, you are practicing dollar-cost-averaging. This ensures that you will buy more shares when prices are lower and fewer shares when prices are higher. This is the \u201cbuy low\u201d recommendation in action. Micro-investing apps have their pros and cons. The benefit of these round-up investment apps is that you can get started and continue investing regularly. The disadvantage is that if you only invest your spare change and do not set up a larger automated deposit into the app, it will take you a long time to build a substantial account balance. For example, assume that monthly, you invest $50 in spare change into your investment account, which earns an average 7% per year. After 10 years, that account will be worth $8,704. Now add in a $350 monthly auto deposit in addition to the $50 spare change investment and you\u2019re investing $400 per month. With an average 7% annual return, your account will grow to roughly $69,637 in 10 years. Yes, there are multiple reasons to use an automated investing platform.

Learn the various ways to invest in Web 3.0 EDUARD MUZHEVSKYI / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY / Getty Images The internet has connected the world in more ways than any other technology. With people getting more concerned about their data and privacy, however, the internet in its current state seems inadequate. There are serious concerns over how big companies handle and monetize user data, creating the need for a better or alternative internet. Web 3.0 is an alternative that is becoming popular because it puts the internet's power back into the hands of end users. We\u2019ve answered common questions around Web 3.0 investments in this guide, in a way any beginner investor can understand. Web 3.0 offers investors different investment vehicles that can cater to different risk appetites. Nevertheless, just like every form of investment, investing in Web3 is risky and should only be done with adequate research and a good strategy. The most common Web3 investment options are stocks, cryptos, and NFTs. However, there are also less popular investment methods you can consider, such as angel investing or buying into the IDO (Initial DEX Offering) or ICO (Initial Coin Offering) of a crypto company. In both methods, you invest in a company by participating in a seed round or buying its coin before launch. One thing to note is that most of Web3 investing is based on narratives: investors spreading the word on what a company is doing to grow the Web3 ecosystem. However, you shouldn\u2019t depend on narratives when making decisions.That\u2019s because some Web3 influencers push a good narrative about a project to get people to buy into the project, and then they end up dumping the project. Instead, focus on investments with a reasonable historic performance, like these three options. Stocks are one of the easiest ways to get into Web3, especially as they give you some level of Web3 exposure. Several companies actively involved in Web3 are Web2 companies with multiple sources of income, and so might not be affected by a Web3 downturn like these Web3 stocks: NFTs are unique digital assets on a blockchain. They show ownership and cannot be copied. You can buy an NFT from a secondary marketplace such as OpenSea or Magic Eden or choose to mint them and hold for a profit. NFTs are important Web3 investments because they can be used to unlock special privileges or as an investment in a Web3 company. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies operated by a decentralized entity on the blockchain. Like regular money, crypto can be used to pay for goods and services and as an investment option. Crypto allows direct exposure into the space and is a good fit for people who want to aggressively invest in Web 3.0 Crypto is highly volatile. So, if you\u2019re a risk-averse trader, you might want to consider other lower-risk options like crypto ETFs and fractional shares. These options provide you with direct exposure but cushion you from the market's daily volatility. Web 3.0 investments, like any other investment, poses some risk to investors. The biggest risks are volatility, security, and reliability on existing Web3 investment processes and infrastructures. The foundation of Web3 is built on emerging technologies such as blockchain tech, smart contracts, and AI. An investment into Web3 positions gives you the chance to be an early adopter of these disruptive technologies. Web3 has the potential to overturn how we do almost everything, from shopping to payments to the way we consume content. As an investment class, Web3 will shape how companies will raise startup capital and generate money from their funding rounds. Most importantly, investment in Web3 is largely profitable and can provide impressive returns over shorter time frames. To get the most out of any Web3 investment, you must: Investing in Web3 can be challenging, especially if you don\u2019t have a clear plan or failed to do your research. It\u2019s essential you consider these factors before you make a Web3 investment: After you have clearly designed and mapped out your investment goals and the investment timeline, you need to know the founders behind the Web3 project of interest. Choose projects with publicly known founders. You can easily reach out in case the project goes south. Assess your risk tolerance level and go for a project allowed in your country to avoid legal issues with your investment. Web 3.0 (or Web3) is a general name for the new, user-centric version of the internet that integrates new concepts like decentralization, blockchain tech, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) into everyday internet use. It is a decentralized version of the internet that promises to help users better control their data usage and sharing while enhancing monetization and reducing exposure to data manipulation. The concept of Web3 is not to make our current internet obsolete; it\u2019s to integrate these technologies into the existing infrastructure, allowing everyone to freely use the internet. For example, if you make a Facebook or Instagram post that goes against Meta\u2019s community standards, the social media giant could take the post down or ban your account. This would likely be impossible in Web 3.0 since most platforms will be decentralized. Although it is still a work in progress, many individuals, companies, and even governments have started to position themselves adequately for web3. The Hong Kong government is preparing to adopt a framework for integrating this technology into many of its city's processes. Since Gavin Wood coined the term in 2014, Web3 has grown to offer potential for diverse opportunities. In recent years, there have been lots of conversations around Web3 and the opportunities it offers investors. While Web3 investment opportunities have become an industry buzzword, many have yet to realize its importance and how they can invest before it officially launches. No. You cannot invest directly in Web 3.0, but you can choose to be an active or passive investor through a variety of investment options. Active investment options include cryptocurrency and NFTs, while passive investment options involve buying stocks in companies actively engaged in Web 3.0. Web 2.0 is the current internet, which has birthed innovations like social media, e-commerce stores, and search engines. These innovations have made content king and provided a way to create content, unlike in Web 1.0, where internet users could only access limited information. Although beneficial, these Web 2.0 innovations introduced data and privacy issues, giving tech giants access to tons of user data. Web 3.0 is an upgrade to Web 2.0 and offers a way for internet users to control their data, use decentralized technologies to store and share information, and voluntarily conceal their digital identities. In Web 3.0, users will make faster and cheaper payments for goods and services using cryptocurrencies. With Metaverse development currently underway, Web3 could change how we experience the world around us, opening us to more immersive experiences e.g the Metaverse. Web 3.0 investment options are more volatile than regular investment options. Although not completely unsafe, there is a big risk of ending up on the wrong side of the volatility. This is why it\u2019s critical to have a good level of knowledge, do your research, and come up with a robust investment plan. Another issue of concern is in regards to the current state of regulations. This new technology is still very much unregulated, and governments and regulating bodies could institute policies unfavorable to investors. Web 3.0 investing is not for all types of investors, especially those with a low-risk appetite or who are looking to get into investing gradually. It is a fast-moving investment class that requires some level of industry knowledge, patience, and timing. The nature of Web 3 investments makes them a good fit for investors who fall into any of the categories below. Investing in Web 3.0 is highly risky. As a Web3 investor, you should have a huge risk appetite and only put in money you can afford to lose. The volatility of many Web 3 assets makes it a highly unpredictable asset class. For example, between February 20, 2023, and March 10, 2023, Bitcoin rose to $24,500 and plummeted to $19,500 before touching $30k. Without a huge risk appetite, you could prematurely sell your investments and make constant losses. To make tangible returns on your Web 3.0 investment, you need to put in a significant sum of money. Since it is recommended that you use not more than 10% of your entire portfolio to make Web3 investments, you need to have a diversified portfolio that is not fully reliant on this investment class. A higher capital investment would yield more returns but could also translate into more losses. Consider investing in leveraged assets and futures trading if you have a big risk appetite but limited capital.

Learn what it takes to invest in gold and silver Somkhane Sawatdinak / Getty Images For thousands of years, precious metals like gold and silver have been used as currency, an investment, and a symbol of wealth. The key points that draw investors to these metals are their long history as a store of value, their low correlation to often volatile financial markets, and their utility as a hedge against inflation. On the downside, investors in precious metals may have to deal with liquidity issues and a lack of yield generation. With inflation rising from historically low levels, financial conditions becoming increasingly uncertain, and the price of gold reaching all-time highs in September 2024, it is no surprise that the interest in gold and silver is again on an upswing. We\u2019ve compiled the best practices for investing in gold and silver, along with answers to common questions to help you get started. Buying silver and gold through financial instruments shifts some of the risks\u2013storage and insurance is someone else\u2019s problem\u2013but it also means you no longer have an investment you can physically touch. There are numerous gold and silver funds that investors have access to today, many of which can be purchased using traditional brokerage accounts. Some funds are proxies for direct ownership of silver or gold, holding only bullion of those specific metals, while others cover the sector more broadly with some percentage held in other precious metals. The goal of these funds is to mimic the price movements of a specific precious metals index or a specific metal\u2019s price. Some funds are mainly holding physical gold and the price moves up and down in sync with the benchmark price. Other funds may try to mimic the benchmark price of silver or gold using a mix of physical gold, options, and futures. The performance of these funds will, of course, be reduced by the expense ratio of the fund and the more active a fund\u2019s strategy is, the more it will cost. Gold and silver funds can be thought of as an investment in precious metals without the actual hassle of storing, buying, or selling them. The fund structure allows for greater liquidity, meaning you can easily add or subtract from your gold or silver holdings without having to get items verified and physically shipped around the dealer network. Gold and silver funds aren\u2019t direct investments, however, and they sometimes will not track the exact price of physical gold. That said, they do still provide investors with the diversification of physical gold or silver without the carrying costs. When we talk about gold and silver funds, we are speaking specifically about funds that provide exposure to physical gold and silver bars but are much more liquid because of the ability to trade shares across global markets. There are also funds that invest in the stocks of companies mining deposits of these precious metals. We will take a closer look at these investments next. Gold and silver mining stocks are heavily influenced by the market price of the deposits they are mining, but the connection isn\u2019t always exact. Miners are judged by the quality of the deposits they\u2019ve assayed and the feasibility of getting the metal out of the ground. This complex judgment is being recalculated every time the market value of those deposits changes. There is also a significant segmentation within the mining industry, with junior mining companies that are in the development and exploration phase. These companies prospect for land with a higher chance of uncovering large mineral deposits. Junior mining stocks tend to be more volatile than those of major mining companies, which tend to track more closely to metals prices based on their proven deposits. Major mining companies are also more likely to be in a position to pay dividends and see share price appreciation when metal prices are on an uptrend. Although there are pure gold and silver plays in both the junior and major categories, investors looking to invest in gold and silver mining stocks may be better served by a sector Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) like the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (DGX) or iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners ETF (SLVP). Like the stocks themselves, the ETFs can offer a mix of dividend yield and appreciation. If you are set on investing directly in particular stocks, it is important to understand the industry and get familiar with the preliminary feasibility studies, reserve estimates, and valuation methods so you can apply this information. Gold and silver can also be traded via financial derivatives like futures and options. With futures, an investor is able to use leverage to gain either long or short exposure to metals prices on centralized exchanges. A unique risk of futures contracts for precious metals is that you could end up with delivery of the underlying precious metals if contracts expire and you haven\u2019t rolled your position into a longer-dated contract. Unlike owning gold as a hedge against inflation or equity market downturns, traders use gold futures to make leveraged bets on the price of gold without ever intending to take delivery of the underlying metal. As with any form of leverage, however, the upside and downside risks of trading precious metals through futures are amplified. Similarly, gold and silver options are derivative contracts that can have gold and silver futures as their underlying asset. But they can also be written off of physical metals prices. Like futures, gold and silver options are less capital intensive, allowing for more leverage. The downside risk is limited to losing the cost of the option if it expires worthless, while the potential for profit with some options strategies is theoretically unlimited. Although gold and silver options and futures are not limited to just the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), it is one of the long-established exchanges and is a good place to observe the market and understand how the derivatives approach to silver and gold works. It is important to remember that this is a higher risk, higher potential return way to get exposure to silver and gold and is not for beginners just looking for an inflation hedge.

To make the most of this style of trading, you will need a brokerage account that is margin enabled and has strong charting capabilities. Physical gold and silver are, of course, the original ways people invested in these precious metals. Wearable wealth like jewelry was followed by coins and more standardized forms of physical gold and silver. Today, investors have two categories of precious metals to choose from: bullion and jewelry. Buying physical gold and silver in either of these forms generally involves going through a dealer. This can either be done online or in person, with reputation being the key factor in choosing, followed by markup and fees. The structure of the physical gold and silver market means dealers play an important role in verifying the purity of the metal being purchased and usually offer complementary services like storage and insurance. Gold and silver are both mined from deposits in the earth\u2019s crust. This raw form is then extracted and refined before being alloyed. The amount of alloyed metals depends on the application. Gold, for example, is alloyed with silver or copper to give it more strength when being formed into jewelry, while gold bullion should contain the bare minimum of alloys needed to keep it firm. Bullion is a term that encompasses physical bars and coins, but we\u2019ll deal with the bars first. Bars are formed rectangles of gold or silver that are 99.5% or higher in terms of purity. Bars vary in size from under an ounce all the way up to 400 ounces. Bars have a stamp that is the equivalent of the manufacturer\u2019s label indicating the weight and purity. One of the reasons a reputable dealer is essential is because there are many ways to create counterfeit forms of physical goods like a gold bar. Gold bullion was once considered to be strategically important to national governments because some currencies followed a gold standard, where the currency was backed by a physical equivalent of gold and could, in theory, be traded in for gold. Since the 1970s, however, we have been operating in a fiat currency system. Therefore, when people are turning to gold as the last store of value in fear of a financial crisis, they are usually looking at gold bars as a way to protect against fiat currencies. Regardless of individual reasons for wanting to invest in gold and silver bullion, bullion bars come with some of the highest barriers. For instance, they have to be stored securely, should have insurance, and must be physically sold to realize gains. A major risk with gold bars is that they can be stolen. They can also be hard to liquidate in larger sizes. This means investors have to think about the size of the bar\u201410 one-ounce bars are easier to parcel and sell than one 10-ounce bar\u2014and where it is kept. Outsourcing this to a service provider is a natural solution, but it becomes an ongoing cost and a drag on eventual returns. Moreover, although bars are the purest form of physical gold or silver, they are still value-added, formed products with a markup over melt value and dealer-specific fees or charges (shipping, storage, insurance, etc). Gold and silver coins, also called bullion coins, straddle the line between an investment asset and a collectible. Unlike utilitarian bullion bars, gold and silver coins have an aesthetic value that often causes them to be priced above their simple melt value. The more beautiful a coin is, the more rare it is, or the more demand there is for a coin for whatever reason, the higher that coin's numismatic value will be. Gold coins come in ounces and fractions of ounces (half ounce, quarter ounce, one-tenth ounce, etc.) and are priced at a premium to their melt value on original sale from the mint. After that, the value of the coin can uncouple entirely from the melt price if it is deemed collectible and sees high demand. Generally, however, the melt price is the floor for a gold or silver bullion and will fluctuate along with the gold or silver spot price. American Gold Eagles, Canadian Maple Leafs, and South African Krugerrands are well known types of gold bullion from their countries\u2019 respective mints. Mints are the national bureaus that act as the sole manufacturers of legal tender in a nation; they are permitted to produce commemorative bullion coins. The U.S. Mint provides a product schedule where collectors can watch for new releases. As gold and silver coins are rarely traded solely on their melt value, they are more of a collectible than an investment. Investors can access bullion coins through the same dealers that trade in bars, and can also order directly from mints. While this introduces markups and fees to the equation, coins are smaller in size, which helps to keep shipping fees lower than what is typical with bars. These coins do offer some of the same features as bullion bars in terms of diversification and low correlation with the financial markets. They also come with similar risks, however, requiring secure storage and insurance for any large collections. ayala_studio / Getty Images As the last category for investing in physical silver and gold, jewelry sits the furthest from traditional investing. While the markup from the melt price for a gold coin can be 50% or more, the markup for jewelry can be many times the actual market value of the metals making up a particular piece. Jewelry has more in common with art than bullion bars, and an authenticated piece with a famous former owner can trade at whatever value the market will bear. Jewelry containing some amount of precious metals is more widely traded than bullion, but this can actually make it more challenging to find reputable dealers in the secondhand market. Authenticity and confirmed purity is critical in pricing jewelry, but the aesthetics or history of a piece can completely change the market value. This doesn\u2019t completely erase the inflation hedge and store of value aspects, but it does weaken these benefits. When it comes to market valuation, the subjective nature of jewelry, the similar needs for secure storage and insurance, the higher risk of fraud, and the lack of any recurring yield make jewelry more of a collectible than an investment. The type of brokerage account you need depends on the type of precious metals investment you are looking to make. For investments into silver and gold funds and mining stocks, a simple brokerage account will do. If you intend to trade futures and options, you\u2019ll have to confirm the brokerage provides these options. Opening a brokerage account requires the same basic pieces of personal information as most financial accounts. This includes: With most brokerages operating online now, you\u2019ll likely need to provide an email address to create an account. Prior to investing, you will need to answer some questions to establish your income level, investment experience, net worth, and so on. These personal questions are part of the know your client rules. Many brokerage accounts no longer require a minimum deposit. If you are looking to access gold and silver investments through ETFs, you can get started with very little as some brokers even offer fractional shares of these ETFs. Gold individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are a bit more complex than a regular IRA, as a custodian must hold the physical assets. You cannot store your IRA bullion in your house, for example. To set up a gold IRA, you first establish a self-directed IRA, select a custodian to administer the account, select an approved depository to hold the assets, and then choose a broker/dealer to buy the gold through. Custodians specializing in gold IRAs will help refer clients to an approved depository as well as gold dealers. According to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), \"precious metals dealers often times are not licensed or registered to provide investment or trading advice to retail customers. They are typically salespeople who are paid commissions based on the products they sell. Unlike financial professionals who have a fiduciary responsibility to you, these dealers are not obliged to have your best interests in mind. As a result, commissions and profits often drive their recommendations.\" The documents required are the standard ones for investment accounts: Minimum deposits in a gold IRA can be quite high. This is somewhat expected - as of September 2024, the price of a one-ounce bar of gold is over $2,700, and you can only hold approved bullion or coins in your gold IRA, as per IRS rules. Some gold IRAs do not advertise a minimum, but there are others that start at $10,000, $25,000, and even $60,000. Companies like Augusta Precious Metals do a good job of educating the public about popular gold and silver dealer scams, and the company's products are designed to help customers steer clear of these scams.  Augusta Precious Metals Offer: FREE GOLD\u00a0when you open a gold IRA.\u00a0ZERO fees\u00a0for up to 10 years (everyone qualifies). The main factor to consider when opening an investment account is whether it provides access to the assets you are after. As long as that is true, choosing between accounts mainly becomes an exercise in comparing fees and capabilities. When it comes to investing in silver and gold as a financial derivative, many brokers can fill that need without much in the way of costs. If you are specifically looking at a gold IRA, however, the fees can be quite steep between companies and you also need to consider the mark-ups and fees that the dealer will be expecting. It is worth combing through the disclosures and fee schedules once you have your search narrowed down to a few promising candidates. Investing in gold within a retirement account can provide a hedge against inflation and exposure to an asset that has traditionally taken a safe haven investment role in times of financial market turmoil. You can easily gain exposure to gold in a traditional IRA by purchasing shares in gold ETFs, as most IRAs through brokerages allow you to specify some ETF investments. For people looking to own physical gold in a tax-advantaged account, setting up a self-directed IRA with a custodian and approved depository is required. Finding the right company for a gold IRA can simplify things a lot. There is no one best way to invest in gold. If you are looking to own physical gold, bullion bars are the most cost efficient way, as the aesthetics matter less than the purity and weight, so the markup is reduced. If you are looking for exposure to gold as a financial hedge in a portfolio, it is hard to beat an ETF due to its liquidity and ease of purchase. If you are looking to trade off the gold price action, then options on gold futures require the least amount of capital and bring leverage to the table. The only ways of investing gold that can be considered \u201cbad\u201d are bullion coins and jewelry, as the aesthetic angle makes them more of a collectible than an investment. Gold does provide diversification from market assets, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is necessarily for you. People using gold as a financial hedge are looking to offset some of the risks of having their primary wealth tied up in financial markets. If you don\u2019t hold any stock, bond, or ETF investments, you will likely get a better return buying those first before worrying about holding gold. Similarly, a person holding all their wealth in gold is forgoing a lot of regular yield and has seen long periods of underperformance relative to the market. That said, investing in gold through an ETF is a low-risk and relatively inexpensive way of getting exposure if you\u2019re interested. Even physical gold is fine if you want. Just remember that if you have the knowledge to invest competently in something, it is worth considering.

Learn what it takes to invest in alternative assets Jackyenjoyphotography / Getty Images For those striving for added diversification, potentially strong returns, and less correlation with traditional stocks and bonds, alternative investing might be for you. These types of assets include commodities, real estate, crypto, art, wine, and more. Formerly the purview of wealthy, accredited investors, today anyone can access alternative investing opportunities through crowdfunding platforms and funds. Keep in mind that in exchange for the promise of added diversification and high returns, you\u2019ll need to accept limited liquidity in many cases. Read on for an alternative investing how-to guide. Interest and opportunities for alternative investing have exploded since the 2008 recession, stock market decline, and mortgage market meltdown. As traditional markets tumbled, investors were hungry for investments with a negative correlation to traditional stocks and bonds. Alternative investments typically gain popularity during periods of heightened equity market volatility and economic weakness. Alternative investment vehicles encompass assets outside of typical stock and bond markets. Previously available only to the ultra-wealthy, today opportunities are accessible for smaller investors as well. Examples of alternative investment vehicles include: Millennials and newer investors have embraced alternatives as popular celebrities like Matt Damon and Reese Witherspoon tout their benefits. You can easily access alternative investments through crowdfunding apps such as Fundrise and Crowdstreet. Private funds, publicly traded real estate investment trusts or REITs, and managed ETFs also open the door to alternative investing opportunities. Most investors are aware of the return potential of investing in individual stocks or stock market ETFs and mutual funds. Over the past hundred years or so, the U.S. stock market delivered a 9+% average annual return. But that return also included occasional years of double digit declines, like the -18.01% drop in 2022 and the -36.55% crash in 2008. Along with the potential for strong performance, easy access, and liquidity, investing in the stock market is a core asset class for long term investors. Investors continue to seek out alternatives to investing in stocks, as well as assets that are lesscorrelated with the stock market. This adds to the demand for alternative investing. Depending upon the alternative investment vehicle, average returns will vary from a low of 5.0% for a debt fund to a double digit return for some real estate partnerships and other niche alternative investment products. Alternative investments and stocks have some major differences: Adding alternatives to a diversified stock and bond portfolio has the possibility of minimizing volatility and potentially bolstering returns. Remember that there are no guarantees in investing. How to buy alternative investments will vary based upon the platform and type of assets. If you buy an alternative ETF or mutual fund, you\u2019ll need to open an investment brokerage account. If you\u2019re buying alternatives via a stand alone firm like Cadre, Peer Street, Realty Mogul, or Arrived, you\u2019ll follow the \u201cset up an account\u201d guidelines. Sample process to buy alternative investments: Some alternative investment offers are for specially qualified or accredited investors, while others are available for all. If the platform is exclusively for accredited investors, you\u2019ll need to provide proof that you meet the accreditation standard. Accreditation criteria: If you\u2019re wondering how to invest in art or how to invest in wine, there are various options. The simplest way to invest in art, wine and specific high-end collectibles is through a crowdfunding app like Yieldstreet or Masterworks. Otherwise, you can buy and sell through specialty dealers or at auctions. You\u2019ll need information to verify your personal data and financial status, if you\u2019re investing on an \u201caccredited investors only\u201d platform. All platforms require investors to open an account and provide basic personal information such as: Accredited investors might need to provide additional bank or tax statements to verify eligibility. Minimum deposits range from as low as $10 to $20,000 or more. Some platforms have a distinct minimum for each specific project. For example, FarmTogether, limited to accredited investors only, has crowdfunding offers starting at $15,000 and a Sustainable Farmland Fund that requires a $100,000 minimum. If you\u2019re investing in an alternative ETF or mutual fund, you\u2019ll typically find reasonable minimums. Fractional shares of a REIT or commodity ETF can be purchased at Fidelity and other investment firms for as little as a few dollars. ETFs or exchangetraded funds are available to all investors, accredited and non-accredited. Alternative ETFs come in a multitude of varieties including merger, arbitrage, risk parity, crypto, metals, real estate, multi-asset, and commodity. You can purchase ETFs at traditional investment brokerage firms like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, and E*TRADE. Many of the investing apps, like M1 Finance, Robinhood, Webull, and Public, also provide access to ETFs. Sample alternative ETFs include: The promise of lower correlations with stocks and bonds is a major draw of alternative investing. Pension funds and institutional investors have included alternatives in their arsenal for years. Yet, lumping all alternatives into one group might be cavalier. Keep in mind that within the broad category, there are a range of investment types. Some alternatives, like commodities, can provide a hedge against price inflation and protect your capital as prices soar. Investments that are negatively correlated with stocks and bonds can bolster your financial assets when traditional investment values tumble. Certain alternative investments, like hedge funds and private real estate deals, provide the possibility of higher returns and lower correlations with traditional assets. If you are seeking diversification beyond traditional stocks and bonds, then alternatives open up an avenue with a possibility of higher overall returns and lower volatility. Today, all investors have access to alternatives, although some would argue that the best deals are reserved for high-net-worth accredited investors. The promise of higher returns and reduced investment portfolio volatility is a possibility, not a certainty. Some private alternative investment vehicles are not SEC regulated, adding to their risk. Higher risk of loss accompanies the promise of higher returns. Some alternative investment founders lack the expertise and training that you\u2019ll find in the managers of most highly regulated mutual and exchange traded funds. With alternative investing, you might encounter uncommon tax reporting, causing additional tax preparation headaches. Many alternative investments have long lock-up periods and are illiquid. That means you may not recoup your initial investment for a period of months or years. Some of the best deals are only open to accredited investors. Fees for alternative investments can also be excessive. While ETFs and mutual funds typically charge less than a 1% expense ratio, some private alternative offers levy high expense ratios and additional performance-based fees. Another disadvantage of alternative investments is lack of income. Unlike bonds and many stocks, commodities, precious metals, art, wine and other alts don\u2019t offer any cash flow. To counteract lack of liquidity, many alternative investments offer secondary markets. Secondary markets are avenues to buy or resell an asset that was bought or sold during the original offer. Conversely, a primary market is the platform where you can buy a new offer. It might be a stock initial public offering (IPO) or a crowdfunding real estate platform where you buy a share of real property from the original owner. Most stocks and bonds are liquid and readily bought and sold through public exchanges, which are secondary markets. Several alternative investment platforms offer their own marketplaces or secondary markets, where sellers can locate interested buyers for less liquid investments. Before investing in any alternative asset, it's useful to understand the liquidity of the product. Many advisors suggest giving your money a job. When investing, begin with a plan that includes: After defining your goals, timeline, and risk level, you\u2019re ready to create an investment portfolio and decide whether to add alternative investments to your stock and bond holdings. If you seek the added diversification and return potential of alternatives, and can accept the risk and liquidity parameters, then you might add this asset class to your stock and bond investments. Typically, diversification principals suggest maintaining a smaller proportion of alternative investments within a diversified portfolio. Only invest money in the financial markets that you don\u2019t need within the next three to five years. This goes for alternatives, stocks and bonds. While stocks and bonds are liquid and can be rapidly sold, many alternative investments require a few months to many years before redemption. When investing in alternatives, understand the liquidity options for the investment. Private investments for accredited, wealthier investors might require five- to six-figure minimums and lock-up periods up to 10 years. Before purchase, determine if there is a secondary market for the investment and whether you can accept the expected lock-up period. Understand your money\u2019s job. Is it capital appreciation for the long term, cash flow and appreciation, or stable value and liquidity for short term goals? Any money that you will need for an upcoming vacation, down payment on a home next year, or for emergency cash probably shouldn\u2019t be in an alternative asset. These types of investments are usually difficult to liquidate. After you\u2019re clear on your financial goals and when you\u2019ll need the money, you can decide if a particular alternative investment is right for you. Read the investment\u2019s fine print and match your time horizon for the money with estimated lock-up periods for your alternative investments. In general, plan to own alternatives for the long term. Building a diversified portfolio begins with determining your goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. Your assessment of those factors will determine whether to create a conservative portfolio, if you\u2019re less risk tolerant and have a shorter timeline, or a more aggressive investment mix, if you\u2019re younger and can tolerate more price volatility within your investments. In general, conservative investment portfolios contain greater percentages of fixed income bonds and cash, and less allotment to riskier stocks. The opposite applies to more aggressive portfolios. Any investment portfolio might include a small allocation to alternatives, which will be included within the riskier portion. Generally, it\u2019s recommended to maintain less than 10% of your liquid assets in the riskiest assets, like alternatives. Returns and portfolio volatility are inversely correlated with the level of risk within the portfolio. Higher risk portfolios might achieve higher returns, with greater volatility. Conversely, expect lower returns and volatility from more conservative portfolios. Alternative investments span a wide variety of assets beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Alternative investment choices include any investment apart from individual stocks and bonds, stock and bond funds, and cash assets like CDs or money market funds. Examples of alternative investments include real estate investments, commodities, currencies, hedge funds, and various other unique assets. With the recent launching of crowdfunding alternative investing apps, there are multiple choices for alternative asset enthusiasts. If you\u2019re wondering how to invest outside of stocks, here is a sample of alternative investment ideas: You can have a sufficiently diversified investment portfolio without alternatives. Whether you should buy alternative investments depends upon your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline. There are several reasons why you might buy alternatives: Ultimately, only you can decide whether you should buy alternative investments or not.

Learn how to invest in AI and capitalize on the future Xavier Lorenzo / Getty Images Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept\u2014it's a transformative force reshaping industries and everyday life. Before investing in AI, it\u2019s useful to understand what artificial intelligence is; AI technology infuses computers and tech products with human-like intelligence and problem-solving abilities. From virtual assistants in our homes to autonomous vehicles on our roads, AI is quickly being added to many products and applications, dominating discussions of investments and questions about the future. The AI landscape is complex and news of added capabilities at one firm reshuffles the pace of change at all of them. Choosing the best AI companies to invest in is a tricky endeavor\u2014even if you're using the best online brokers and trading platforms. Just as investors half a generation ago had to separate the wheat from the chaff among web browser, smartphone, and app-based startups, so too are niche players and established tech giants now vying for AI market share and research capital. In this article, we explore how to invest in AI and showcase the best AI stocks and funds. Like past emerging technologies, such as railroads in the late 1800s or the personal computer in the 1980s, there are many ways to invest in AI. While some companies will have wild success, other early companies will fail. The computer revolution is an apt analogy for AI investing and how to invest in AI. Computers set the stage for automating mundane and repeatable tasks, and now AI seeks to advance this concept by automating tasks that previously required human intelligence. Investors can find some top AI stocks have one-year returns in the high double digits, with NVIDIA reporting 176% 12-month growth as of July 23, 2024. Some people want to invest directly in companies that develop AI, while others might invest in those companies that stand to benefit the most from its wider adoption. Using the introduction and growth of the personal computer industry as an example, some investors successfully invested in computer manufacturers or hardware companies that made routers and switches. Others invested in software companies that produced computer programs, while others attempted to identify companies that would benefit most from the automation that computers offered. Some of these investments were direct bets on computers and the actual technology, while others were more conservative, such as buying shares in already strong companies that stood to benefit from the growth of computer usage. The point is that there are various ways to invest in a new technology. Sometimes, one firm takes and holds a market-leading position, but other times, an imitator can use the first company's technology better, making it more successful over time. Since it\u2019s tough to pick the winning AI stocks in advance, owning several or selecting an AI ETF could minimize making a wrong move. While these are among the top AI stocks, consider the business cycle and valuations before going all in. You might want to incorporate a dollar cost average into your AI stock picks as a hedge against a market drop. Investing in professionally managed ETFs or mutual funds that hold shares in AI companies allows you to leave it to a fund's professional managers to research and pick suitable AI companies. Through an ETF, you own a share of a portfolio of multiple AI stocks within a single investment. Buying individual AI stocks is more work for the investor. Given the multiple ways to invest in AI, the first step is to read about the industry to understand the various aspects of artificial intelligence. Within the AI universe, there are pure plays and more conservative plays, and you'll have to decide the type of exposure you want in this market sector. Once you have an idea of the parts of the AI market you want to invest in, you can perform traditional investment analyses\u2014both fundamental and technical. AI is exploding, and the technology behind it appears poised to break out further and deliver on expectations for more widespread adoption across a wide range of businesses and real-world applications. Like any technology that requires massive capital investment, AI offers plenty of opportunities for investors to make money, but new technologies also involve risk. You'll want to determine the best way to gain exposure without involving risk beyond your tolerance. Choices include more speculative direct AI investments in individual companies or ETFs and mutual funds that offer a portfolio of multiple companies in the AI space. You can also look to invest in companies that are positioned to increase their revenues as AI is more widely adopted across the economy. Generative AI use for images is among its most popular applications. Users can type or speak of an image they want to create, and an AI program can produce an image that meets that description\u2014most of the time. These AI programs use the user\u2019s description with images available worldwide to generate the image for the user requesting the artwork. People of all ages and backgrounds have utilized AI-generated artwork. Once you\u2019ve created AI art, you can sell it and/or buy from others on AI art marketplaces. Art made with AI can be collected as giclee prints, digital downloads, NFTs, and other formats. It can be bought and sold on some crypto platforms and designated AI art websites. However, the profit and investment potential for AI art is still in its infancy and cannot be accurately ascertained. Startup companies are often created in new and promising fields, such as AI and machine learning. Often, these are companies that have been initially capitalized by venture capital investors, then taken public to capitalize on their initial investment and to raise more capital as the business increases its operations and begins offering its products to a wider customer base. Many startup investments are only available to large accredited investors. Other websites enable the public to invest small amounts in promising new ventures. You\u2019ll need to sift through the offerings to uncover the AI startup companies. While investing in startups can be risky, the rewards for investing in a successful startup company can be huge. Examples of successful startup companies include Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Yes, you can directly invest in AI and machine learning by investing in individual stocks or in ETFs or mutual funds that focus on AI stocks. Conservative investors wondering which AI stocks to buy might consider established companies that are benefiting from AI processes, while aggressive investors can seek out investments in direct AI companies. For AI investing ideas, check out the best AI stocks. This list is updated monthly. Investing in AI in 2024 offers compelling prospects for your portfolio. The technology continues to seep into the media, healthcare, automotive, finance, and other sectors. However, you'll have to navigate challenges that could include potential legal and regulatory changes, supply shortages, and the broader political and ethical considerations concerning the widespread deployment of AI systems and the ecological effects of powering them. Similar to investing in the new internet and computing industries decades ago, the winners and losers can change on a dime. Staying informed and selectively investing in companies prioritizing robust business models will be crucial for those looking to capitalize on the AI boom while mitigating risks.

            "title": "Dunning-Kruger Effect: Meaning and Examples in Finance",
            "content": "Adam Hayes, Ph.D., CFA, is a financial writer with 15+ years Wall Street experience as a derivatives trader. Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master's in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology.

Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. The Dunning-Kruger Effect is a cognitive bias first described by psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger in 1999. It occurs when people with low levels of knowledge, skill, or competence in a particular field overestimate their own ability and knowledge. Put differently, people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about tend to (incorrectly) think they do know what they\u2019re talking about. At the same time, experts in a field may underestimate their own knowledge and competence. This part of why Dunning and Kruger\u2019s findings are similar to imposter syndrome, whereby high achievers begin to doubt their abilities. In finance and investing, people who overestimate their knowledge and ability because of the Dunning-Kruger Effect may make unwise or overly risky investment decisions that can result in significant losses. This can happen, for example, when people feel confident in their ability to predict market trends or understand complex financial instruments, despite lacking the necessary expertise. The Dunning-Kruger Effect is thought to occur due to a combination of cognitive limitations and a lack of subjective self-awareness. Individuals with limited knowledge or expertise in a field are often unaware of their own limitations, which can result in an inflated sense of competence. In other words, when someone doesn\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know, they are prone to overestimate their knowledge. It has been described colloquially as \u201cdumb people who do not realize they are dumb.\u201d At the same time, those with more expertise may come to underestimate their abilities as they become more aware of the complexities of their field. The phenomenon was first described in a 1999 study titled \u201cUnskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One\u2019s Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments,\u201d by social psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger. Another reason for the effect could be a lack of insight or metacognition, which is the capacity to reflect honestly and objectively on one\u2019s own skills or performance. If someone consistently overestimates their abilities, they may also be more likely to reject feedback, which can play a role in continued underperformance. In addition, the effect may occur as people use their own subjective criteria for what it means to be good at something, rather than objective, standardized measures. The authors discovered that people with low levels of competence in a particular domain were more likely to overestimate their abilities, while those with higher levels of competence were more likely to underestimate their abilities, forming an inverted U-shaped plot. Dunning and Kruger assessed participants\u2019 actual and perceived abilities in a disparate range of fields including humor, logical reasoning, and English grammar. The Dunning-Kruger Effect is a type of cognitive bias. Many similar psychological biases affect financial investors, including representative bias, cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, attachment bias, home-country bias, anchoring bias, and the endowment effect. In the grammar study, college students completed a test on American Standard Written English, then self-evaluated their perceived grammar ability and expected test performance. Those who scored the lowest on the test tended to drastically overestimate both their perceived grammar ability and expected test score, while those who scored highest tended to underestimate their ability and test score. Comparing self-assessments (subjective ability) with actual performance (objective ability) remains the primary way to detect and measure the Dunning-Kruger Effect.\u00a0A 2008 study replicated the original findings, showing that people in the lower quarter in terms of actual performance expected to see results of 60% when they scored only 38.4%. People in the middle half expected to score 72.6% but actually scored 61.7%. Meanwhile, those in the upper quarter expected to score 75.6% and actually scored higher, averaging 84.1%. Several other studies have also replicated these general findings across various contexts. Dunning and Kruger\u2019s findings show that as an individual\u2019s actual competence increases, the disparity between self-assessment and actual performance decreases, eventually leading to a more accurate self-assessment. The Dunning-Kruger Effect affects individuals across various fields, including business, finance, medicine, and politics. It can often lead to poor decision making, inefficiency, and other negative outcomes. The Dunning-Kruger Effect can manifest in the form of employees taking on tasks beyond their actual skill set or making decisions without fully understanding the ramifications or possible knock-on effects. Additionally, people who suffer from the effect may reject feedback or constructive criticism because they remain convinced of their own abilities and defend the choices that they have made. This can lead to a lack of growth and development, as well as difficulty working collaboratively with others. One potential pitfall is that hiring managers may erroneously hire bad candidates who appear confident during the interview process but are actually victims of the Dunning-Kruger Effect. Similarly, promotions may be handed out to these types of employees for similar reasons. The Dunning-Kruger Effect can significantly affect financial decisions and investment strategies. Inexperienced investors may overestimate their abilities to pick stocks, analyze companies, or predict market trends, leading to poor investment choices and potential financial losses. This also includes a failure to recognize risks that may be present but are not recognized. People who overestimate their abilities may ignore expert advice, such as from a financial advisor, especially if that advice goes against their preconceived notions. In medicine, this effect can lead to healthcare professionals overestimating their knowledge and making incorrect diagnoses or treatment recommendations. This can take the form of missing a critical diagnosis or failing to order the appropriate tests, leading to delayed treatment or even a misdiagnosis. This, of course, can have serious consequences for patient care and health outcomes. To guard against the Dunning-Kruger Effect, it\u2019s important to seek out diverse perspectives, recognize one\u2019s own limitations, and be open to feedback and constructive criticism. Being both humble and realistic about one\u2019s actual abilities and knowledge may be difficult, but it is critical for avoiding the pitfalls described above. Engaging with colleagues, mentors, and subject matter experts can also help build a more accurate understanding of one\u2019s knowledge and abilities and can help avoid costly mistakes. Don\u2019t assume that you are superior or know more than those with expert training and credentials in a field. Indeed, education and training are the best way to gain the actual knowledge base needed to make expert claims. Furthermore, healthcare organizations can establish clear guidelines and protocols for decision-making processes that individuals must follow regardless of what they think they know, and provide opportunities for professionals to collaborate and share their knowledge and expertise. The \u201cdouble curse\u201d of the Dunning-Kruger Effect arises when: Since the original study by Kruger and Dunning in 1999, several studies have replicated and supported the existence of their namesake effect across various domains. However, some scholars have questioned the statistical modeling used in the original study and criticized the overapplication of the theory to a range of situations where it might not be relevant. Despite these criticisms, the Dunning-Kruger Effect remains widely recognized as a genuine cognitive bias that can influence people\u2019s perceptions of their own skills and knowledge. While there is no exact opposite of the Dunning-Kruger Effect, imposter syndrome may be used to describe the fact that highly trained and skilled people may underestimate their own ability or worth. Imposter syndrome occurs when those who are competent and accomplished nevertheless feel like they are frauds or imposters who don\u2019t deserve their success. This can lead to feelings of self-doubt, anxiety, and a fear of being exposed as a fraud. Impostor syndrome can affect anyone, regardless of their profession, background, or level of achievement. However, it is commonly associated with high-achieving individuals, perfectionists, and/or those in competitive environments who may come to doubt their own abilities. First identified in 1999 by a pair of psychologists, the Dunning-Kruger Effect describes a ubiquitous phenomenon among people in which those with low skill or knowledge tend to greatly overestimate their skills and knowledge. Conversely, those with great skill or knowledge tend to underestimate themselves instead. The impact of the Dunning-Kruger Effect spans many domains and contexts, and in the world of business and investment can lead to poor hiring and promotion decisions, overconfidence, bad trading strategies, and excessive risk taking, among other detrimental effects. To minimize the Dunning-Kruger Effect, one can educate or train themselves to become an expert in a field, listen to knowledgeable advice and feedback, and be open to new ideas.

Learn the best ways to earn passive income and build wealth Bus\u00c3\u00a0 Photography / Getty Images The best ways to earn passive income aren\u2019t only the purview of the wealthy. With a modicum of startup time and capital, anyone can create a passive income stream. Whether you have a full-time job or are a retiree seeking extra cash, passive income ideas are available to increase your cash flow. Passive income isn\u2019t literally money without effort, but more akin to money with less effort. Some passive income strategies, like owning dividend-paying stocks or bonds, require less work than owning rental real estate. This guide covers how to get started, how much passive income you can earn, the required effort, and various passive income investments. 15 Passive Income Ideas: There are scores of passive income sources and ways to start earning passive income. Before you begin, you\u2019ll need to figure out how much effort and money you want to expend. Then choose a passive income idea that fits your capital, skills, and interests. Step 1: Choose passive income streams. Decide whether you want to invest for passive income or run a side gig that generates some cash. Either way, it typically takes some time to build up a decent cash flow. Step 2: Choose the platform that fits your needs. If you\u2019re seeking passive investment income, there are many financial brokerage firms, mobile investment apps, and banks that will suffice. However, there are other measures you can consider. For instance, you can learn how to make passive income online by selling products and services. With a social media account like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, or a website, you can market products and services quite effectively. These are among the best ways to earn passive income, and the required effort is greater in the beginning and diminishes as time passes. Step 3: Set your expectations. Earning passive income from investing involves predicting your return based upon the investment amount. A $5,000 investment in a dividend fund that pays a 6% yield will provide $300 per year, while successful affiliate websites might earn $1,000 per month or more. The best passive income opportunities often involve balancing human capital, financial capital, and time. Investing in financial markets involves banking and financial products like stocks and bonds. Buying banking products like certificates of deposit and high-yield cash accounts is less risky, but has lower upside potential than investing in financial market assets. Passive investing in dividend-paying stocks or interest-paying bonds provides cash flow but requires a larger investment to realize meaningful monthly income. Crowdfunding investment apps also enable the public to buy shares in farmland, large and small real estate projects, wine, art, and more to receive ongoing cash flow. There is a range of risk levels when investing in financial assets. The lowest-risk cash flow-producing assets are money market mutual funds, high-yield savings accounts, and bank certificates of deposit. Investing in dividend-paying stocks or stock funds carries the risk that the dividend will be cut and also that the principal value of the investment might fall. Interest-paying bonds and bond funds will vary in price as well, but the interest payments are rarely cut. Individual bonds, held until maturity, will return the par or full value of the investment. But bonds sold before maturity and bond funds might be sold for less, or more, than your original payment amount. Crowdfunding apps that invest in real estate, farmland, startups, art, wine, and more carry additional risks. Many require long lockup periods before you can withdraw your money. Others are not as closely regulated as traditional financial assets. With newer platforms, there is a greater chance of asset defaults and business closures. Buying dividend-paying stocks is a path to owning a portion of a publicly traded company. Many stocks pay a portion of their earnings to shareholders in the form of cash dividends, which are usually paid quarterly. You have the option to reinvest the cash payment in additional shares of stock or to take the cash dividend payment. Long-term investors who build up a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks or funds have one of the best ways to earn passive income.\u00a0Investing in dividend-paying stocks is a passive income idea with both cash flow and capital growth potential. A dividend exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle that owns many dividend-paying stocks. You can buy one investment, such as the SPDR S&P Global Dividend ETF (WDIV), and receive access to a portfolio of dividend-paying companies. The WDIV ETF owns global companies that frequently pay higher dividends than U.S. firms. Many dividend ETFs also screen for companies with a history of increasing dividends. The dividend ETF is another passive income investment that provides regular cash payments along with an added bonus of capital appreciation potential. Consider management fees when choosing a dividend exchange-traded fund, as higher fund fees can detract from returns. Bonds are back in favor as interest rates are higher than they\u2019ve been in decades. Unlike stocks, bond investments are loans that you make to a company or government entity. In exchange for the loan, you receive regular coupon interest payments. Bonds are among the best ways to earn passive income because if you buy a newly issued bond at par, usually $1,000, and hold it until maturity, you\u2019ll receive regular cash interest payments and a return of principal at the bond's maturity. Bonds with lower credit ratings typically provide higher interest payments and greater cash flow, while government bonds and highly rated corporate bonds will offer lower interest payments. Bond values can rise and fall, so you might receive more or less than your initial price, should you sell before maturity. The bond\u2019s credit rating suggests the bond\u2019s likelihood of default, with lower-rated bonds carrying a higher risk of default. Investors can also invest in diversified bond mutual or exchange-traded funds to build passive income without lifting a finger. Bundle together a group of individual bonds, and you have a bond fund. With differing bond maturities and investment styles, there are multiple ways to generate passive income with bond funds. Those comfortable with a risky asset can purchase a high-yield bond fund like the SPDR Blmbg ST HY Bd ETF (SJNK), which has a current 7.05% SEC yield. More conservative investors can buy a diversified government bond fund and receive regular interest payments that are exempt from state and local taxes.\u00a0Unlike buying an individual bond, both the coupon or interest payment and the fund value will vary. Certificates of deposit (CDs) are banking products that you can buy at most financial institutions. You invest a specific amount of money, typically $100 or more, and leave the money invested for a period of time. CDs typically pay a pre-specified interest rate and are usually issued for terms from three months to five years or more. There are a variety of CD types, including fixed and floating variable interest rates. Investors seeking regular cash flow and a stable principal value can create a CD ladder and buy CDs at regular intervals. As one CD comes due, you reinvest the proceeds in a new certificate of deposit. Ladders are among the best passive income investments to increase cash flow when you expect interest rates to rise. A bank high-yield savings account pays higher interest payments than a typical savings account. The required minimum balance can be greater than that of a savings account. If you\u2019re wondering how to make passive income, a high-yield savings account is a good choice. For passive income from money that you need for near-term expenses and emergencies, a high-yield savings account is a sound choice and keeps your funds liquid. The process of opening a high-yield savings account is similar to opening a traditional bank account. Simply click on the \u201copen an account\u201d button on your preferred bank\u2019s website and answer several personal questions, such as address, Social Security number, and type of account. To verify your identity, you might need to supply prior addresses, debts, and employment details. A money market mutual fund is an investment vehicle that owns short-term commercial debt. This investment is distinct from a money market bank account, which is similar to a high-yield bank savings account. Like a typical mutual fund, money from many investors is pooled to invest in short-term debt and cash-equivalent instruments. The allure of these accounts is that the share value is pegged at one dollar, and yields are among the highest of the high-yield cash equivalent group. You\u2019ll need to invest in a money market fund within an investment brokerage account. These investments are liquid, and the money can be withdrawn within a few days. The interest from money market funds can be withdrawn for cash flow or reinvested to grow for the future. You\u2019ll find a laundry list of alternatives to stock, bond, and cash passive income ideas. Some of these choices are more passive than others. Real estate investing is frequently touted as a response to the question, \u201cWhat is the best way to earn passive income?\u201d But real estate investing takes many forms, and requires varying amounts of effort. Owning and managing real property requires a chunk of capital and is a passive endeavor until a pipe breaks or the renter doesn\u2019t pay their rent. Then it is a lot of work. Real estate crowdfunding apps or investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs) are more passive. Once you purchase the securities, you wait for the cash flow. Another popular way to earn passive income online is by creating an affiliate website, but this involves more work than meets the eye. An Airbnb rental is only semi-passive if you hire a team to manage the property. Cash-back credit cards and shopping sites might be considered a passive income idea, yet you\u2019re spending in order to receive the cash. That\u2019s not a net-positive endeavor. Other alternatives to passive income involve digital property sales, like e-books, courses, apps, and other online goods. For all of these passive income ideas, there is a hefty startup time commitment and some upfront cash as well. You\u2019re also less certain of receiving a return on your investment if the sales miss expectations. Evaluate these alternatives to passive income to learn whether there's a strategy for you. A real estate investment trust or REIT is an investment vehicle that owns a pool of commercial real estate. There are REITs that provide broad diversification across the real estate landscape. Or you can buy niche REITs that own senior housing, student housing, warehouses, commercial property, mortgages, shopping malls, data centers or many other varieties of property. The benefit of REITs for cash flow is that they are required by law to pay out 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. Debt investing is popular, with many platforms that enable everyday investors to be the bank and lend money to others. Peer-to-peer lending offers various types of loans for various reasons. Platforms match borrowers with lenders for various cash needs. These peer-to-peer lending apps offer higher interest payments than other traditional stock, bond, or cash vehicles. But they are riskier as potential loan payment defaults can eat into your returns. To minimize that risk, you can choose to invest in higher-quality loans and diversify by owning many loans. Real estate crowdfunding allows investors to finance real estate projects through online platforms with the goal of profiting either from capital appreciation or passive income. There are a range of real estate crowdfunding websites offering small to large investors an entry into commercial, industrial, single-family, and apartment building investing. Fundrise is our 2024 best real estate crowdfunding website. It provides investment access to real estate and startup venture capital funding with only a $10 minimum. Real estate crowdfunding can deliver a higher interest rate than REITs, but it has less liquidity, less government oversight, and a greater risk of default. Real estate debt or note investing puts you in a banker's seat. You lend money to those seeking to buy new real estate, remodel existing property, fix and flip, and a variety of other types of real estate investors. Apps like Groundfloor provide investors the opportunity to lend to real estate buyers. The allure of lending to real estate borrowers is that your investment is secured by real property. Some of the larger real estate crowdfunding apps also deliver real estate note investing. A drawback to real estate note investing also makes it one of the best investments for passive income. Unlike publicly traded securities, you can\u2019t immediately redeem your shares, but may need to wait several months or more for a return of your principal investment. The lack of liquidity can also lead to higher investment returns. Affiliate marketers sell products and services on their websites or social media accounts and receive a commission from the brand for the sale. Affiliate marketers frequently write reviews to draw visitors to their websites. The setup for affiliate marketing is not passive and involves creating a website or social media platform, developing contracts with companies who pay affiliates, and creating content to draw visitors to the website. The passive aspect of affiliate marketing is that once the content is written and a website develops a stream of visitors, your work is diminished. That\u2019s only partially true, as you\u2019ll need to write new content and update old content in order to maintain and increase website traffic. Additionally, it can take months or more to begin to generate cash flow. We place affiliate marketing on the higher-effort step of the passive income ideas ladder. Creating digital products or content, such as online courses, is among the best ways to earn passive income online. Similar to affiliate marketing, you\u2019ll sell your digital products online through a variety of outlets, such as an Etsy store, social media platform, YouTube, or a website. Align your digital products with your area of expertise. Sample types of digital products include printouts, e-courses, e-books, webinars, and more. This is not the best passive income idea for beginners with limited free time. Making passive income with digital product sales initially requires market analysis, product creation, and marketing before realizing decent passive income flow. Drivers with cars can get paid to wrap their cars in advertisement banners. We found firms that paid from $100 to $500 per month just for driving with an advertisement on their car. For anyone wondering, \u201cWhat is the simplest way to make passive income?\u201d Car wrapping is not without its limitations. Car wrapping scams exist and, unfortunately, are abundant in the industry. Don\u2019t pay money upfront for access to advertise with car wrapping. You\u2019ll also need to accept the advertiser's stipulations of mileage, and other factors. Finally, making passive income by advertising on your car means that you need to drive around with an ad on your car. To put this in perspective, the ad can be simply placed on the door or hood of your car, or it can be wrapped around the entire vehicle. Make sure you understand what\u2019s needed before signing a binding contract. Creating an online store with drop shipping can answer the question, \u201cHow can I passively make $1,000 a month?\u201d After setting up your product inventory, payment system, and marketing strategy, drop shipping is among the simplest ways to make money online. Select products from manufacturers or wholesalers and sell them as your own inventory. The supplier handles the inventory and shipping, so you can grow your brand and market the shop. Like most passive online income strategies, after setting up the business, you\u2019ll need to devote a lot of time to marketing. You can market your store through a website and/or social media. Once you\u2019re up and running, with brand recognition and customers, maintaining an online store with drop shipping is a good form of passive income. All passive income ideas require startup capital. To develop a meaningful passive income stream from financial assets like cash equivalents, stocks, and bonds, you\u2019ll need a decent account balance. With $100,000, an investment paying a 5% dividend or interest payment provides $5,000 per year cash flow. Although affiliate marketing requires a small cash outlay to potentially obtain cash flow, you\u2019ll pay more with your human capital or time. All investments carry a degree of risk. Certificates of deposit and high-yield cash investments don\u2019t risk the principal value of your investment, but they could lose purchasing power over time due to inflation. Investing in higher-risk dividend-paying financial assets involves the potential to lose principal and decrease cash flow should dividends be cut. Crowdfunding passive income investments are less regulated and can tie up your money for longer periods with added risks of defaults and platform failures. With the exception of tax-exempt municipal bonds from your state of residence, all income is taxed by the government. After-tax income is what really matters, so understand how your investment is taxed, and your specific marginal tax bracket. Dividends and interest payments may have their own tax rates. Passive income is money that you earn without much effort. In contrast with earned income, from a job, passive income flows after an initial startup effort and cost to create long-term cash flow. Passive income ideas span low-effort activities such as buying a high dividend bond fund to creating online businesses that require an initial startup effort which becomes less labor-intensive over time. There is a fine line between active and passive income. Clearly, going to work every day in exchange for a regular paycheck is active income. Task work such as food delivery, rideshare driving, freelance jobs, consulting, and contract work are also ways to create active income. With active income, you get paid for working. Passive income ideas span a range of jobs that require less effort than active income. Receiving income in exchange for zero effort is unlikely unless you count receiving an inheritance or winning the lottery. Writing a book and then receiving royalties is a great example of passive income, yet with the passage of time, book royalties will decline. In contrast, if you buy a dividend-paying stock fund, once you select the investment, you will receive ongoing dividend payments without much additional effort. Some passive income ideas are liquid, like buying dividend-paying investments, while others are less liquid, like long-term real estate syndications. Some passive income jobs require minor ongoing work in exchange for cash flow, while others are less passive and involve greater ongoing effort. Passive income strategies range from those with a small startup effort, like investing in dividend-paying stock or money market mutual funds, to more labor-intensive ones, such as managing rental properties or creating an affiliate marketing review website. By creating digital products like courses, apps, e-books, and more and selling them, you can create passive income with minimal cash. Books can be sold on digital marketplaces like Amazon, while you can sell other products through your social media accounts or an online store. While you don\u2019t need a lot of cash to create digital products, you need time and effort to market and sell them. If you have a job with a 401(k) or other retirement account, you can contribute part of your paycheck to that account and invest in financial assets. At retirement, you\u2019ll have enough money to create a passive income stream. Yes, you can live off of passive income. It\u2019s easiest to live off of passive income if you live in an area with a low cost of living. To live off of financial investment and cash-equivalent income, you\u2019ll need a larger amount of money. To earn $30,000 per year, you\u2019ll need $600,000 invested at 5% per year. To live off of digital product or service sales, you\u2019ll need to earn several thousand dollars per month. The same goes for affiliate marketing. Older individuals who have built up a large amount of investable assets are most likely to be able to live off of passive income. The exceptions are those who\u2019ve made a lot of money early in life, live simply, and invest for income and capital growth. To pick the right passive income idea, assess your available time, risk tolerance level, and available capital. Also, explore your skill sets to determine which passive income ideas are a good fit for you. The easiest way to start investing for future passive income is to start small and automate your investing. Everyone should consider investing for the future. When you are older, it\u2019s easier to create a passive income stream with investing. Younger individuals with ambition and the ability to motivate themselves are wise to consider creating passive income streams through online stores and creating digital products. Employment is uncertain, and creating multiple streams of income is a sound financial plan. Yes, all income is taxable. Earned income is taxed at the federal, state, and local level. You\u2019ll also pay self-employment tax with earned self-employment income. Investment income has its own tax considerations. While real estate can be taxed in various ways. To understand how passive income is taxed, it\u2019s wise to visit the IRS website for more details. Online tax software programs such as Turbo Tax can help you estimate the tax you\u2019ll pay on passive income. While passive income won\u2019t impact the amount of your Social Security benefit, it can affect the amount of tax you\u2019re required to pay.\u00a0 Up to 85% of your Social Security benefits can be taxed. Like all IRS regulations, there is a list of criteria to determine the impact of your passive income on the taxation of your Social Security benefits. Visit the SSA.gov website to understand how your passive income could impact the taxation of your Social Security benefits. Teenagers have many money-making ideas available to them. Unless you have access to a large sum of money, earning passive income through investing in dividend-paying assets is unlikely. Creating an online business as a teenager is a potential path to future passive income. Starting an online store, selling digital products, creating an e-course, or writing product reviews are all paths to ultimately making passive income as a teenager. Teenagers can promote their businesses online through a website and/or social media accounts. These beginner passive income ideas require substantial startup effort and a modicum of long-term maintenance.

            "title": "How Information Bias Can Lead to Poor Investing Decisions",
            "content": "Adam Hayes, Ph.D., CFA, is a financial writer with 15+ years Wall Street experience as a derivatives trader. Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master's in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology. He is a CFA charterholder as well as holding FINRA Series 7, 55 & 63 licenses. He currently researches and teaches economic sociology and the social studies of finance at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University. Information bias occurs when information or data obtained by someone is measured or recorded incorrectly such that it no longer accurately reflects the underlying truth. This bias can be the result of a simple error in data collection or information processing, be caused by deliberate distortion, or arise from a subconscious tendency to filter information to meet one\u2019s needs or conform to preexisting beliefs. Information bias can significantly affect an investor\u2019s decision making, leading to anywhere from less-than-ideal to dangerous investment choices. This is because human beings are naturally predisposed toward confirmation bias (when we seek out and prioritize information that fits our preconceived notions while dismissing contradictory evidence) and recency bias (when newer, more salient information is given more weight than it might really have), among others. In today\u2019s age of social media and constant connectivity, it is more important than ever to be aware of the types of information we receive and how they can help or hinder investment decisions and financial outcomes. Information bias can lead investors to make bad decisions based on faulty data, or to seek out and rely on irrelevant or excessive information when choosing among market moves. The proliferation of social media has made it easier than ever to access vast amounts of information from all sorts of sources, making information bias a critical issue. Information bias can negatively affect an investor\u2019s decision making; for example, someone may place undue importance on a single news article or tweet, ignoring the broader context of a company\u2019s performance or the market as a whole. Or an investor may seek out information that confirms already-held beliefs about a company or the broader market and ignore or downplay contradictory evidence. Some types of information used by investors may not be as relevant to trading decisions as they might seem. For instance, day-to-day fluctuations in stock prices are often influenced by external factors such as broad market sentiment, which may not necessarily reflect a specific company\u2019s long-term prospects. Similarly, a company\u2019s past performance may not be a reliable indicator of its future performance, as business environments and circumstances change and evolve over time. Research has shown that investors who focus on relevant information and avoid information bias can make better investment decisions. For example, a study by behavioral economists Brad M. Barber and Terrance Odean found that individual investors who traded less frequently and paid less attention to stock market news achieved better returns than those who traded more frequently and paid more attention to the news. To avoid information bias in investing, consider the following tips and strategies: The information bias in the \u201cMarket for Lemons\u201d refers to the fact that asymmetric information can lead to market failures. The idea was first introduced by economist George Akerlof in his widely cited 1970 paper, \u201cThe Market for \u2018Lemons\u2019: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism.\u201d In his paper, a \u201clemon\u201d refers to a used car with hidden defects that only the seller knows about, not the buyer. This concept can be extended to other markets where the quality of goods is uncertain. The information bias in the lemons problem stems from the fact that sellers have more information about the quality of their goods than buyers do. As a result, buyers face uncertainty about the true quality of the goods they are purchasing, and they may be unwilling to pay a higher price for what they perceive as potentially low-quality goods. Behavioral finance has identified several cognitive biases that can negatively affect investment decisions. Some of these include implicit bias, overconfidence, trend-chasing, loss aversion, and anchoring and adjustment. Behavioral economics is the synthesis of psychology and economics to understand how individuals actually make decisions in various real-world settings. It challenges the rational-actor model assumed by mainstream economics and uses experimental techniques to identify empirical phenomena. Behavioral finance is the application of behavioral economics to financial contexts, including investing. Shared information bias is the tendency for group members to spend much of their time discussing information that the individuals in the group are already familiar with rather than seek out unfamiliar information. This can lead the group to reach suboptimal conclusions. Biased information is data or information that doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the true state of the world. Information can become biased for several reasons, including mistakes in its collection or analysis, subconscious predilections when obtaining information, or deliberate distortion. In behavioral economics, confirmation bias, recency (availability) bias, and asymmetric information are all information biases that can negatively influence investors\u2019 decisions. Staying objective, obtaining information from a wide range of sources (including contradictory evidence), and soliciting the advice of others can help minimize these possible negative effects.

            "title": "Most Valuable Autographs",
            "content": "Karon Warren has 20+ years of experience researching and writing about banking, mortgages, credit cards, savings, and other personal finance topics. When you meet your favorite singer, actor, or sports figure, it can be thrilling. Naturally, you might want to commemorate this occasion by getting this person\u2019s signature. Later on, you may think that autograph could become a collectible or quite valuable. The reality is, not all autographs will convert into cash. Whether or not an autograph has value beyond sentimental value will depend on several factors, including what surface it\u2019s written on. Not every signature from a notable or famous person will translate into a high-value autograph. However, some factors will help improve the value of an autograph. A signature that is clear and easy to read is more valuable. Even if it\u2019s not easy to read, a signature may still be recognizable as the person\u2019s iconic autograph and have some value. If there are stains on the paper that make the signature difficult to read, that could diminish the value. After all, a blurry or hard-to-read signature can be difficult to authenticate, resulting in little to no value. The material or item that contains the autograph also has an impact on its value. Signatures on a piece of paper or in an autograph book probably won\u2019t garner much value as signatures on unique items related to the person. For example, if you have a Hall of Fame baseball player\u2019s autograph on a baseball or bat, the autograph is likely to be worth a lot more than if it were on paper. Similarly, the signature of an actor on the script for their Academy Award-winning movie would also fetch more than just a signature on paper. As with all collectibles, if the item is more rare, it has more value. A rare signature will be in lower supply and higher demand, so it will yield a higher price tag. If there are many autographs of the person, say from someone generous with giving out their signature, their autograph can become less valuable. If a lot of collectors prize a particular autograph, it will be more valuable. Autographs that are very popular are in smaller supply compared to their demand. The markets change for which autographs are in high demand, depending on the celebrities or stars of the day. Similarly, if someone is famous but no one wants their autograph, their signature will become less valuable. Prices for autographs vary widely. They ultimately depend on what someone is willing to pay for it. If you have an autograph that you know others are willing to pay for, say an autographed rookie baseball card for Hall of Fame third baseman Chipper Jones, you likely could demand a higher price. eBay lists one for $79. Keep in mind that just because an autograph is listed for a certain price, it\u2019s not necessarily worth that price. Again, it\u2019s worth is what a buyer is willing to pay. Consider conducting research with companies that routinely sell autographed items, such as Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s, which are both notable auction houses that deal with high-value objects. Appraisers who specialize in autographed items also can give you an estimate of how much the autograph could be worth. Where and how you sell an autograph depends on what you think it is worth. For instance, if you estimate that the autograph has a high value, you may want to work with a notable auction house like Christie\u2019s or Sotheby\u2019s to sell your item. If the item has some value, you may consider having a reputable dealer sell the item on your behalf. Or you can try to sell the item yourself through online auction sites like eBay or online marketplaces like on Facebook. Most of these options will take a commission when selling your item for you, so be prepared to pay that fee once the sale is closed. Through the years, some autographed items have commanded much more money than others. Valuable autographs have included signatures from presidents, athletes, and celebrities, among others. Examples include: The condition of the autograph, as well as what the autograph is written on, are among the factors that determine an autograph\u2019s value. However, the most important factor is who the autograph belongs to, and whether it is in high demand. Whether or not the autograph is rare also plays a role in its value. You can sell an autograph for whatever price someone is willing to pay. However, to find a realistic price to list your autograph, check with auction houses, appraisers, or dealers, which can provide an estimate of the worth of your autograph. You can find out what your autograph is worth by having it appraised by a professional appraiser for a small fee, typically $30 to $40. They can give you an estimate of the autograph\u2019s value along with some information on its authenticity. The most valuable autographs are those in good condition, signed on something considered noteworthy, and signed by an individual considered noteworthy. How much you can actually sell the autograph for depends on the demand for the autograph and how much someone is willing to pay for it. If you have an autograph that you think could be extremely valuable, it\u2019s important to have it authenticated by a professional at a notable auction house or by a reputable appraiser.

            "title": "The Economics of Stamp Collecting",
            "content": "Maybe you had a parent or grandparent who collected stamps or taught you about philately, the term for stamp collecting. Stamp collecting began as a hobby shortly after the first postage stamp was issued in the United States in 1847. As stamps developed different values, the colorful squares from different locations like Hawaii and Madagascar were bought and sold for their collectible value. Interest in stamp collecting has declined in popularity in recent years. Today, philatelists are largely made up of baby boomers and investors. Retirees may have more time to devote to the hobby, but they may be reticent to invest in the most expensive, high-end stamps that attract investors. Learn more how investors approach buying stamps for their portfolio, how the economics of philately works, and more about current trends in stamp prices. In 1988, the American Philatelist Society had 57,815 members, according to the organization\u2019s website. Today, it has less than half as many. People may be losing interest in stamp collecting for a number of reasons, including the fact that the value of many stamps are declining. The rise of more efficient research tools like the internet has improved transparency surrounding buying and selling stamps, and has actually led to their devaluing. That\u2019s in part because collectors discovered that many stamps weren\u2019t as rare as originally thought. Several factors go into stamp valuation. They include the stamp\u2019s image, its edges or perforations, the original denomination, the country of origin, and the history or backstory of the stamp. If a stamp has errors from printing, it may actually be more valuable because they were taken out of circulation, so they are more rare. Older stamps may be more valuable if they are used, attached to an envelope with a special cancellation. Typically for a used stamp, the lighter the cancellation mark, the better. The depressed price of collector stamps may be viewed by some as a buying opportunity for long-term returns. However, most hobbyists collect stamps for the love of storytelling and passion for the history behind the stamps. One study published in the Journal of Financial Economics found that British collectible stamps from 1900 to 2008 had returns of 7.0% nominally, and 2.9% in real terms. These returns are generally higher than the average returns on bonds, but lower than returns on equities. It\u2019s more on par with returns found with art. More rare and expensive stamps tend to yield greater returns for investors. The most expensive stamp ever sold was a British Guyana One Cent Black-on-Magenta, which sold for $9.5 million in 2013, then again most recently in 2021 for $8.3 million. Stamps can be an excellent way to diversify an investment portfolio, but they are not a replacement for more traditional investments like the stock market or real estate to help you meet your financial goals. Stamps are highly illiquid, meaning that they take time to convert into cash. That\u2019s because if you want to sell a stamp, you may have to wait months or years before finding an interested buyer, depending on the demand for the particular stamp. Stamps are physical investments. You must store them properly or they can lose value. Many dealers reported a resurgence in stamp collecting after the global COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. Shuttered in their homes, people had more time to devote to their hobby. For investing purposes, the value of stamps depends on demand, trends, origin, and condition of a stamp. Unused stamps are more valuable than used ones. However, if a stamp is very rare, it could be investment-grade even if its condition is less than perfect. If you are looking for a stamp to buy as an investment, look for stamps with undamaged, original glue or gum; unused stamps with gum; used stamps without gum; stamps that are rare; and stamps in superb, fine, or good condition. Investment stamps can provide portfolio diversification. This is because they tend to be unaffected by the factors that determine the value of other assets. For example, their value is not influenced by the stock market or a real estate boom. You can either buy stamps on your own or buy a portfolio of stamps, such as five to seven rare stamps that you keep for a period, say five to 10 years. When the term is up, if the stamp\u2019s value hasn\u2019t increased, the selling company will refund your investment. On the other hand, if the value has increased, the seller takes a percentage of the profit. This type of investment can go up as well as down and is considered a capital-protected investment. If you\u2019re interested in investing in stamps, work with a reputable dealer while being aware of trends that could change a stamp\u2019s value. Philately clubs also may include investors who may act as mentors. Keep in mind the fundamentals of what affects the value of a stamp, from its image to its perforation. Be aware that while these assets have fairly low volatility and tend to steadily increase in value, they can also decline in value depending on demand trends.

You can learn more about our\nindependent review process\nand partners in our\nadvertiser disclosure\n. We may receive commissions on purchases made from our chosen links. Webull and eToro both have origins outside of the United States. eToro was launched in 2007 in Israel and began operating in the U.S. in 2018 as a crypto platform, with expanded assets added in January 2022. Not your typical investing app, eToro has similarities with a social media platform with the social trading aspect of the platform known as CopyTrader. CopyTrader users copy popular traders and interact with others on the home page \u201csocial feed.\u201d With limited stocks, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies, eToro is a bit short of a comprehensive trading platform. In contrast, Chinese-owned Webull offers a more comprehensive investment and trading platform than eToro. Launched in 2017, Webull offers access to nearly the entire stock and ETF universe, options, margin investing, and now futures, making it a fit for beginner investors to intermediate traders. Webull offers a comprehensive trading platform, with features for both fundamental and technical traders. We should note the company has recently split off its cryptocurrency arm into a different entity, Webull Pay, so it no longer has those assets on the platform. There are no trading commissions at Webull, adding to the allure of this snappy investing platform. We\u2019ll delve into the features, similarities, and differences between eToro and Webull to help you decide which investment platform is best for your needs. Don\u2019t invest in cryptocurrency unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\u00a0Take two minutes to learn more. On the surface, both eToro and Webull offer clean, slick interfaces with good user experience on each platform (web-based and app). The eToro website focuses first on the social aspect of the platform, with the user news feed on the home page. The eToro website and app are similar, with your portfolio and access to all assets via the \u201cDiscover\u201d tab on the home screen. The eToro platform is more limited, with less research, fewer tradable assets, and a less sophisticated platform than Webull. The strong social aspect is reflected in the user experience. eToro\u2019s unique social features, CopyTrader for cryptocurrencies and the Popular Investor Program, distinguish it from Webull. These features make it easy to follow the trades of other investors and add to the social aspect of the app. This can be an advantage or a disadvantage, depending upon the profitability of the expert trades and your interest in this modernized version of coattail investing. Webull offers web-based and downloadable trading platforms and a mobile app, which approximates the features of the computer-based experience. Webull surprises on the upside with excellent usability for such a feature-rich platform. The menu items connect to customizable quotes, stock and ETF detail pages, a customizable trading screen, and a comprehensive account tab. While we enjoyed the social experience of eToro, Webull takes the edge in usability by having surprisingly intuitive and feature-rich platforms. Investors can trade from several screens in eToro, including the Trade, Watchlist, and Discover tabs. The eToro platform offers real-time quotes, along with ETF, stock, and cryptocurrency investing. The distinctive CopyTrader and Popular Investor Program features, in addition to the social news feed, create a game-like environment and might minimize the importance of investment research and the risk inherent in the financial markets. The Popular Investor Program facilitates the sharing of trading insights and knowledge and provides compensation to popular investors with more followers. The custom watchlists are synced across desktop and mobile platforms and can be customized with volatility alerts as well. eToro\u2019s research and screeners are barebones, with minimal features and customization. It\u2019s also important to note that when markets decline, no shorting is allowed. This takes a tool designed for declining markets out of the hands of the expert traders and their followers, limiting their ability to adapt to market conditions. Moreover, eToro\u2019s lack of proper volume indicators reduces the accuracy of any volume-related investment strategies. Webull\u2019s web-based and downloadable trading tools and features are more comprehensive than those at eToro. The updated Webull 8.0 adds greater customization and additional features to the trading experience. The platform provides templates for stock, ETF, and options trading. In line with more established and larger investment brokers, the features include additional technical indicators, deeper market news, additional tools for technical and fundamental analysis, and advanced customizable charting. The research continues to impress with probability and testing capabilities not often found in a streamlined investment app like Webull. All in all, eToro leans towards confusing investing with social interaction, while Webull is a better fit for new to intermediate investors and traders looking for a feature-rich trading platform. The mobile experience is comparable to the desktop versions at eToro and Webull. The eToro mobile app is unique within the investment app arena in that it has a social feed. This facilitates interaction with other investors and offers easy access to popular investor profiles. Beginners may like the familiar social media-like feel, while experienced investors looking to trade may be put off by the app's creative user experience. The Webull 8.0 app\u2019s features strengthen the mobile experience as well. Like the desktop version, the app has customizable charting, alerts, options trading, and financial reporting. Advanced traders can access smart trading tools, including 50 technical indicators, 15 charting tools, and the ability to place orders directly from the chart. The updated mobile app is designed for excellent performance on a small screen. The mobile app at Webull is best for serious beginners to advanced investors and traders looking to research investments and trade stocks, ETFs, and options. Beginners might like eToro, but should be mindful about copying others without a basic understanding of investment principles and markets. On March 11, 2024, Webull announced its plans to expand into commodities and futures trading, ahead of a planned listing later in the year. The new offerings will focus on highly liquid futures markets with features including market, limit, stop market, and stop-limit orders. Webull said customers will also gain exposure to underlying asset classes such as commodities, currencies, and indexes. Both eToro and Webull offer stock, ETF, futures, and options, but that\u2019s where the similarities end. Webull users can access roughly all of the 10,000 U.S. traded stocks and ETFs and can trade long and short. eToro offers a crypto wallet to support its cryptocurrency trading capabilities, while in 2023, Webull moved crypto trading into a separate business that customers now access through the new Webull Pay app. eToro users can trade 3,250 stocks, 270 ETFs, futures, and 24 cryptocurrencies. This range of crypto landed eToro our best pick for crypto in the 2024 broker review, but we should note a cryptocurrency exchange obviously has a lot more. Neither platform offers bonds, mutual funds, or other asset classes, but Webull indicates fixed income is coming. eToro clearly has the edge in crypto, but we found Webull had a deeper pool of stocks and ETFs available. The most commonly traded assets are available at both brokers, but Webull simply offers more of them. eToro enables simple orders like market, limit, and stop loss, but lacks more complex order types. At Webull, users will find all the typical orders as well as specialty conditional orders like one-cancels-the-other (OCO), one-triggers-an-OCO (OTOCO), and one-triggers-the-other (OTO), giving it the edge in this category. It is important to note that larger brokers have an even wider selection of order types. That said, Webull offers basic and complex orders that will meet the needs of the majority of traders. Both platforms offer virtual paper trading accounts, which is helpful for those practicing investment strategies before deploying real money. Other similarities between eToro and Webull include payment for order flow (PFOF) and availability of fractional shares. For example, Webull\u2019s payment for order flow averaged $0.01088, which was definitely on the high end of the brokers we evaluated. The broker acknowledges that PFOF is the only reason it can offer a robust trading platform commission-free. Webull is attentive to best execution practices and monitors the platform's metrics monthly, reporting price improvement of $0.0019 on average for the time period evaluated. eToro is vague regarding its actual execution speeds and order routing, reporting a modest $0.00028 in PFOF for the period. eToro attempts to provide traders with the best execution prices and results as is reasonably possible, according to the company. No specific data is offered to substantiate the results of the trading execution claims. The platform leans towards a social, copycat, and momentum model. The social news feed works similarly to the X (formerly Twitter) or Facebook feed, with top movers and CopyTrader portfolios highlighted while typical individual investment research and selection are minimized. Webull emphasizes transparency and achieving the best execution speeds and prices. Trades are routed based on quality of execution, not on payment for order flow. In the most recent data, orders of 100 to 499 shares are executed in 0.096 seconds, with a price improvement per share of $0.0050. The percentage of shares executed at or better than National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) is 97.80%. Overall, we found that Webull\u2019s trading technology is better than eToro\u2019s, and the trading features are more consistent with a serious investment brokerage platform. Neither eToro nor Webull charges commissions to trade stocks, ETFs, or options, while eToro levies a 1% fee to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Margin fees are competitive at Webull at 8.99% for up to $25,000 and down in steps from there to 4.99% on amounts over $3 million. eToro doesn't advertise the use of margin trading very much and restricts its use. Both are essentially no-cost brokers, but it is worth remembering that Webull offers a greater number of assets. The research capabilities at eToro are light in contrast with other investment apps. Users can access a basic detailed quote including fundamental data and lists of advancing and declining assets. The basic customizable charting includes tools and studies for those interested in technical indicators. There are no traditional screeners and limited information about individual assets. The eToro Club, which offers additional features to users with higher assets under management, offers a few financial media subscriptions for those with more than $50,000, but no actual research reports. At Webull, the research amenities include detailed quotes, screeners, tools, and calculators. The charting features are vast, and the platform offers data for both fundamental and technical investors. With the addition of Webull 8.0, the tools for intermediate and even advanced traders are on the rise and include advanced customizable charting. Hands down, the research features are superior at Webull in contrast with eToro. Neither platform wins any portfolio analysis awards. Each platform lacks linking of external accounts or in-depth asset allocation or backtesting strategies. Users can view basic account information and quotes, including price charts. The portfolio analysis at eToro lags that of most competitor investment apps. Webull narrowly improves upon eToro and offers account performance, realized and unrealized gains and losses, internal rate of return, and margin data. These two platforms are essentially tied in this category as they both lack portfolio analysis tools provided by other brokers. Neither of these two brokers is exceptional when it comes to education. The eToro Trading Academy delivers educational training in video and written formats. The content is divided between beginner and advanced. That said, advanced investors are unlikely to find the breadth of investments or research that they need at eToro. The educational topics are not comprehensive. Investing subjects largely cover crypto, options, trading, and how to use the platform. Webull\u2019s investor education is satisfactory with short courses and articles. The topics span stocks, ETFs, trading, and options. Users will also find several videos about how to navigate the Webull platform on the Learn menu. This category is a tie as well. Investors will find more extensive educational offerings on the major investment brokerage platforms. eToro lacks phone customer service and relies on digital help tickets and the FAQ/help section for user questions. Platform usage help can be obtained via videos and articles at eToro as well. Webull provides phone service with live agents during business hours. Webull also offers email support and FAQs along with platform video and article guidance. Webull ekes out a lead in the customer service category, although wait times for phone contact can be long. Both platforms offer two-factor authentication and biometric logins as well as Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) insurance. eToro also offers a digital wallet in which to store cryptocurrency. For additional security, Webull offers an extra passcode for trading access. Webull has excess SIPC insurance for larger account sizes. Both platforms are secure, but Webull wins the category with additional SIPC insurance and trading security. It is important to remember that no insurance protects account holders from changes in asset values. Instead, SIPC policies protect against the failure of the brokerage holding your assets and cash. eToro only offers individual taxable cash accounts and options accounts, while Webull offers individual taxable cash and a margin account for those with more than $2,000 in assets. Webull users also have access to the standard retirement accounts: Webull and eToro both lack the breadth of available accounts found at major brokerage firms like Fidelity, Interactive Brokers, E*TRADE, or Charles Schwab. Between eToro and Webull, Webull clearly prevails with margin, taxable, and retirement accounts. A joint brokerage account would elevate Webull\u2019s standing even more among the popular investment apps. Webull and eToro are vastly different platforms, suitable for distinct investors. If you want to take a small amount of money to invest, follow other traders, and play at investing, then eToro works. Due to eToro\u2019s emphasis on how other investors are trading, its opinions on various assets, the focus on momentum investing, and the minimal research information, we wouldn\u2019t recommend eToro as your only investment app. New investors will not get a well-rounded, research-based investment education at eToro\u2014nor will you get that at Webull, for that matter. Choosing stocks, ETFs, options, and crypto is a risk-return tradeoff and the social aspect at eToro may add to that risk by playing to the crowd-following impulses we all share. Webull is a better alternative for investors who want access to stocks, ETFs, and options. You\u2019ll still need to look elsewhere for basic investment education, but its fundamental and technical trading features are quite good, and even rival some of the more well-known investment platforms. Most technical traders will find what they need at Webull because the overall platform user interface and charting capabilities are excellent. Webull stands out in the investment app arena by demonstrating an ongoing commitment to improving the platform. If you are looking for a streamlined investment experience, Webull is a nice balance of keeping to its investment app roots while embracing some of the best features of its larger competitors. Providing readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of online brokers and trading platforms is a top priority for Investopedia. We combined our industry research, subject matter expertise, and investor survey data to guide the research and weightings for our 2024 online broker awards. To collect the data, we sent a digital survey with 110 questions to each of the 26 companies we included in our rubric. Additionally, our team of researchers verified the survey responses and collected any missing data points through online research and conversations with each company directly. The data collection process spanned from Feb. 19 to March 19, 2024. We then developed a proprietary model that scored each company to rate its performance across 11 major categories and 89 criteria to find the best online brokers and trading platforms. The score for each company\u2019s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria in the following categories: Additionally, during our 2024 research, many of the companies we reviewed gave us live demonstrations of their platforms and services via video conferencing methods and also granted our team of expert writers and editors access to live accounts so they could perform hands-on testing. Through this all-encompassing data collection and review process, Investopedia has provided you with an unbiased and thorough review of the top online brokers and trading platforms.

            "title": "Who Is Ray Dalio?",
            "content": "Michael Bromberg is a finance editor with a decade of experience. He is an expert at elucidating complex financial topics in clear, concise language. Michael received a Bachelor of Arts in literature from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a master's in linguistics from the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellin, Colombia. Ray Dalio is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, with around $130 billion in capital as of June 2022. After receiving a master of business administration (MBA) from Harvard Business School and beginning his career on Wall Street, Dalio started Bridgewater from his two-bedroom Manhattan apartment in 1975. Dalio\u2019s methods and principles\u2014sometimes the subject of critiques but also widely emulated by other executives and organizations in the financial services sector and beyond\u2014played a key role in growing Bridgewater into the financial behemoth that it is today. His philosophy is based on the notion that cause-and-effect relationships are the key to understanding complex realities. Dalio believes that studying how these relationships have shaped the past provides the key to making optimal decisions in the present and unlocking success in the future. Born in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, New York, on Aug. 1, 1949, Raymond Thomas Dalio grew up in a middle-class neighborhood on Long Island. His journey from a normal childhood to become one of the world\u2019s most notable investors began when he was just 12 years old and working as a caddy at a local golf course. The markets were booming, and stocks were a big topic of conversation on the course. Dalio saved up some of the money he was making on the links to buy his first stock\u2014opting for shares of Northeast Airlines because it was the only company he was familiar with that was trading for less than $5 per share. While he would later admit that this was not the most solid basis for choosing an investment, the shares tripled in value because of a buyout, and this initial stroke of luck was enough to transform the young Dalio into a lifelong investor. When he was in high school, although he remained engaged with the financial markets, Dalio showed little interest in academic pursuits. His C average in high school was just enough for him to be accepted into local Long Island University\u2019s C.W. Post College on a probationary basis. However, because postsecondary education offered the chance to focus on finance\u2014the subject that truly interested him\u2014Dalio excelled in school. After graduating at the top of his class in 1971, Dalio headed directly for Harvard Business School, where he received his MBA in 1973. During his time as a student, Dalio was introduced to Transcendental Meditation, which he has credited as a key to his business success. However, the young Dalio was not all peace and tranquility. Shortly after leaving Harvard, he had his first Wall Street position at a firm called Shearson Hayden Stone, where he worked with agricultural commodities futures, providing guidance to cattle ranchers on how to hedge against risks to their business. On New Year\u2019s Eve in 1974, an alcohol-fueled spat led Dalio to punch his supervisor in the face. Following his subsequent termination from Shearson, Dalio convinced some of the agricultural clients to hire him as a consultant, and he founded the firm Bridgewater Associates. Dalio\u2019s initial conception of the firm included a vision for trading commodities overseas\u2014hence the reference to bridging waters in the name\u2014but the company solidified its role as a consultancy. Bridgewater operated under Dalio\u2019s belief that cause-and-effect relationships offered tools to predict every element of a business. When it came to agricultural commodities, he zeroed in on the number of animals and how much meat would come to market, as well as how much cattle eat and thus the amount of grain like corn and soy that would be consumed. Regressions of weather forecasts and yield allowed Dalio and Bridgewater to predict the time and quantity of goods coming to market in a way that other analysts would miss. The superior level of analysis led Bridgewater to some early successes, but there were still some bumps in the road on the story of Bridgewater\u2019s growth from its founding in Dalio\u2019s small apartment to hedge-fund powerhouse. Based on the volatility seen in the markets at the end of the 1970s, Dalio publicly predicted a depression in 1982. Bridgewater\u2019s strategy is designed to function whether the markets are moving upward or downward, and it is adaptable to clients\u2019 risk preferences. However, stocks in the early 1980s instead entered a massive, long-term bull market, causing Dalio to lose almost everything. He was forced to dismiss his employees, sell his possessions, and even borrow money from his father to remain afloat. While the firm eventually recovered, the experience taught Dalio important lessons about avoiding overconfidence and learning from mistakes. These lessons clearly paid off, with Bridgewater eventually becoming the world\u2019s largest hedge fund and earning more money for its investors than any other hedge fund. The firm\u2019s success has been driven by the incorporation of Dalio\u2019s evidence-based investment principles into algorithms and computerized decision-making systems that are backtested and enhanced by human insights to determine the best investments in liquid stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities. Among his many accomplishments, Dalio is known for helping McDonald\u2019s Corp. (MCD) bring the Chicken McNugget to the market. Dalio was working as a consultant for the fast-food giant, which was concerned about securing a source of chicken at a stable price before launching the product. Dalio also advised a chicken producer. By focusing on the chicken as a simple machine based on the feed it required, Dalio helped the chicken producer use corn and soy futures to lock in its costs, which allowed it to offer McDonald\u2019s a favorable fixed price and enabled the launch of the bite-sized and dippable product known throughout the world today. Throughout Bridgewater\u2019s years of growth, Dalio served as the firm\u2019s chief executive officer (CEO), chief investment officer (CIO), and chairman. However, he has stepped down from those positions in recent years, transferring additional responsibilities to his colleagues and partners. In September 2022, Dalio completed his transition from his more formal leadership roles, but he will continue as a mentor to Bridgewater\u2019s CIOs and other top-level managers, a member of the operating board, and a senior investor. Ray Dalio\u2019s net worth as of October 2022, according to the Forbes list of the world\u2019s billionaires. Dalio conducts his business based on a series of principles that he has written down, and which he firmly believes that everyone also should write down and use in their own decision-making processes. Recognizing the cause-and-effect relationships underlying complex realities is a key to success, and unlocking these relationships is the most effective way to guide trading and investing decisions. More specifically, Dalio attributes Bridgewater\u2019s success to his adherence to the following principles, among others: Ray Dalio believes that writing things down is a way of ensuring a thorough analysis. Starting early in the history of Bridgewater, Dalio began to share his ideas with clients in a publication known as Bridgewater Daily Observations. He also published a book in 2017 titled Principles: Life and Work, in which he details his philosophy. He also regularly posts videos to a YouTube channel. Beyond these principles, it is worth mentioning a couple of other ideas central to Dalio\u2019s philosophy and the success of Bridgewater. The firm operates based on the notion of an \u201cidea meritocracy.\u201d In other words, the best ideas triumph, regardless of where they come from in the employee hierarchy. While everyone is entitled to participate in the conversation, idea meritocracy typically gives more weight to the opinions of those with more expertise in the subject at hand. Another important concept for Dalio\u2019s philosophy and Bridgewater\u2019s culture is the idea of \u201cradical transparency.\u201d This involves recording and making available all meetings and interviews within the company, limiting the potential for office politics to devolve into unspoken animosity, covert disagreements, and conflicting agendas. In Dalio\u2019s view, this radical transparency creates an environment of radical truthfulness, with openness and honesty as key ingredients in a team\u2019s success. Ray Dalio is best known as the founder of Bridgewater Associates, which is the world\u2019s largest hedge fund. Dalio founded the firm out of his apartment in 1975 and went on to serve as its chief executive officer (CEO), chief investment officer (CIO), and chairman. A hedge fund is a type of alternative investment managed by professional fund managers who adopt a variety of strategies with the goal of achieving above-average returns. Hedge funds operate as limited partnerships of private investors, and because of the levels of risk involved, they often require a high minimum investment, making them more suitable for wealthy accredited investors. Dalio\u2019s principles involve analyzing the markets like a machine in which complex realities stem from cause-and-effect relationships. He believes that studying many cases from the past provides a foundation for interpreting current conditions and making optimal decisions. Dalio also encourages a culture of \u201cidea meritocracy,\u201d in which the firm adopts the best idea regardless of hierarchy, and \u201cradical transparency,\u201d in which all meetings are recorded to ensure open and honest working relationships. Dalio is a famous investor and the founder of Bridgewater Associates, which he played a central role in growing into the world\u2019s largest hedge fund. His principles of investing, which include focusing on cause-and-effect relationships and analyzing past cases, have had far-reaching influence in the financial world and beyond. Listed as one of the world\u2019s most influential people by Time magazine in 2012, he has pledged to donate half of his wealth to charity during his lifetime.

            "title": "Interactive Brokers vs. Webull",
            "content": "Learn about these two innovative platforms and find out which one is best for you Our editors independently research and recommend the best products and services. You can learn more about our\nindependent review process\nand partners in our\nadvertiser disclosure\n. We may receive commissions on purchases made from our chosen links. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) and Webull are both online trading platforms, but that\u2019s where the similarities end. Founded by Thomas Peterffy in 1978, IBKR has grown into a massive global investment company serving intermediate to professional investors. Webull was founded in 2017 by Wang Anquan, a former Alibaba Group employee, as a low-cost trading website and mobile app. Both IBKR and Webull are self-directed platforms for trading stocks, ETFs, futures, commodities, cryptocurrency, and options, but IBKR also offers\u00a0bonds, mutual funds, forex, event contracts, warrants, and scores of managed portfolios. Moreover, U.S. and international traders can access a wide range of global investment markets at IBKR. While beginners and intermediate investors may be satisfied with Webull, all levels of traders, investors, and professionals will be well served by IBKR\u2019s deep offerings. IBKR\u2019s Lite and Pro tiers ensure there is a plan for beginners through professionals. Interactive Brokers and Webull have also made significant platform changes in recent years, with Webull putting crypto trading in a separate app and adding futures and IBKR making large upgrades to its user experience across its desktop and mobile platforms. We will dissect these two trading platforms to help you decide which one is a better fit for your portfolio needs. Comparing the usability of Webull and Interactive Brokers is similar to the contest between a Honda and a Mercedes. While both platforms offer good usability, their clients are of distinct camps. Newer investors and those seeking a streamlined desktop workstation and a well-designed mobile app for stock, ETFs, and options will find what they need at Webull. The mobile and desktop versions are similar, with easy access to the main features from the home screen. The home page user experience gives you a direct path to stock research, screening, trading, accounts, transfers, and more. Interactive Brokers is a high-end investment platform where you can access all asset classes, global markets, multiple trading platforms, and resources for beginners through professional investors. Given the breadth of the flagship platform, the user experience at IBKR is not as seamless as at Webull. Yet, despite its size, IBKR has made excellent progress in facilitating easier platform navigation. In 2024, IBKR also launched IBKR Desktop, which offers a more streamlined experience combined with the most popular trading features of Trader Workstation (TWS). Users of the downloadable desktop, web, and mobile versions will find similar functionality. At IBKR, you can trade any asset class on any platform, with access to data, charting, research, trading, news, and more. IBKR is still a trader's platform, but Webull had a slight edge in the simplicity of navigation. IBKR Desktop addresses that, If you want the breadth of IBKR products and markets, however, the usability via Trader Workstation is good even though there is a bit of a learning curve. IBKR has two comprehensive trading platforms, the desktop client portal and the downloadable Trader Workstation (TWS), as well as the new IBKR Desktop for a more streamlined experience. The client portal and IBKR Desktop are suitable for all but the most sophisticated investors. You can check your account; place trades; view quotes, news, and research; and access advanced charting. Both have more customization features than many other competing brokers's full desktop platforms. The powerhouse downloadable Trader Workstation (TWS) is for active professional traders and investors. The customizable TWS provides more than 100 order types and gives you all that you need in terms of fundamental and technical charting and portfolio management tools. You can rapidly place orders using hotkeys, trade directly from the chart, stage orders for later execution, manage risk, and access a staggering range of tradable assets across the globe. Webull, for its part, offers a customizable trading platform for stocks, ETFs, and options, and is suitable for casual through intermediate traders. The Webull workstation has customizable templates for stocks, ETFs, options, and day trading. The widget structure enables easy customization. The widgets contain different information, such as news, fundamentals, options, and so on. The advanced order screen includes contingency trading and trades directly from a chart. Webull has more features on its desktop than its WebTrade online platform, and the assets are more limited as well. Webull can work for beginners and even intermediate traders, but IBKR, the winner of our best charting platform for day traders and best online broker for advanced traders, offers an unmatched array of tools for sophisticated investors. Interactive Brokers offers several mobile apps: IBKR Mobile, GlobalTrader, and Impact. The IBKR Mobile app is nearly identical to the computer-based platforms, although advanced users will find the broadest functionality on the Trader Workstation. In a recent revamp, BKR added more dashboards and bundled some of the more popular tools to make navigation easier. The Impact app enables ESG investors to screen for companies that meet specific criteria. Global traders in the U.S. and abroad can access 90-plus stock exchanges to trade in local currency using the GlobalTrader app. Webull recently reworked its mobile app to provide users with another approach to trading with Webull Lite. Its original mode offers all the charting, data, and technical resources, while the Lite version is simplified to just the trading essentials. In the full mode, users can access the smart trading tools, including more than 50 technical indicators and 19 charting tools. We found the Webull app easier to use than the IBKR mobile app, but the difference in the size of the platforms contributes to the complexities that affect IBKR\u2019s app functionality. The GlobalTrader app is more streamlined than Webull and clearly aimed at newer investors. Both brokers have excellent apps, so we were unable to pick a clear winner here. On March 11, 2024, Webull announced its plans to expand into commodities and futures trading, ahead of a planned listing later in the year. The new offerings will focus on highly liquid futures markets with features including market, limit, stop market, and stop-limit orders. Webull said customers will also gain exposure to underlying asset classes such as commodities, currencies, and indexes. Hands down, IBKR is the winner, with access to all the important asset classes and more markets than most investors can reasonably trade. Beyond the basic stocks, ETFs, and options, you\u2019ll find bonds, futures, forex, cryptocurrency, mutual funds, warrants, hedge funds, spot gold, events contracts, and scores of managed portfolios at IBKR. Webull users can trade U.S.-listed stocks, including over-the-counter issues, ETFs, futures, and options. Webull doesn't have a bad selection by any means, but its range of offerings simply cannot match Interactive Brokers\u2019 industry-leading reach. In keeping with Webull\u2019s scope, users can trade the typical order types, including market, limit, stop, stop limit, and trailing stops. Conditional orders like one-cancel-the-other and one-triggers-the-other are also available. Here again, Webull is not weak, but it is simply outmatched. At IBKR, users can access more than 100 order types and algos on the Trader Workstation. Traders can set up order cascades that set the parameters to enter and exit trades without having to actively monitor positions if they so choose. The vast number of available order types makes IBKR the best pick for intermediate through professional investors and active traders. Pro traders will appreciate IBKR\u2019s SmartRouting, which automatically transmits the best available prices. TWS users can select their preferred stock and options smart routing strategies for non-marketable orders. Traders benefit from advanced technologies to further reduce trading costs and improve efficiency. IBKR reported a net price improvement per share of $0.0108 and reports accepting around $0.0020 per share in payment on order flow (PFOF) on the IBKR Lite side. IBKR Pro users barely see any PFOF at all because of the smart routing. In our analysis, we found the PFOF to be much lower than reported. This just confirms that price improvement and speed are the key priorities of the routing process. Webull's trading technology is basic, although it suffices and includes a net price improvement of 0.0050 a share on a 100-499 order size. Unlike IBKR, there\u2019s no smart order routing, trading automation, or ways to route your own orders at Webull. Webull also sees significantly more payment for order flow, although the company is quite open about the fact that it is how the platform is offered for free. The volume of money coming in through PFOF is higher than IBKR, which is notable because of the difference in size. Webull's PFOF was $0.0202 per share in the period analyzed. That is many times what IBKR collects. There is no comparison between the trading technology at IBKR and Webull. IBKR is designed for sophisticated traders and offers substantially more order and trading technology breadth. The cost comparison between Interactive Brokers and Webull is again complicated by the difference in the size of each trading platform\u2019s offering. IBKR\u2019s pricing is complex, especially for Pro account holders. There are three types of equity commissions for Pro traders: fixed per-share of $0.005 with a $1.00 minimum and 1% of trade maximum. Tiered per-share pricing depends upon your monthly order activity. Compounding this, Interactive Brokers serves many countries outside the U.S. and all of them have some manner of regionalized pricing. IBKR Lite users receive commission-free equity and ETF trades, similar to most brokers today, including Webull. Users of IBKR Lite receive lower interest on cash balances and pay higher interest rates on margin borrowing. IBKR is also our best broker for low margin rates, with rates starting at 7.08% (6.08% for IBKR Pro users). Webull charges 8.99% up to $25,000 and 7.99% up to $100,000. Webull\u2019s fee-free trading for stocks, ETFs, and listed options is a boon for fee-conscious investors. If trading cost is a priority, then Webull wins the category. But the limited number of products at Webull versus IBKR means that advanced traders in various assets will find a better overall deal at IBKR. In the research category, we\u2019re again confronted with the distinction between Interactive Brokers and Webull\u2019s scope. IBKR\u2019s research offerings are vast and include robust screeners and trading idea generators for stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, options, and fixed-income products. The tools include options, margin, order quantity, interest, and financing calculators. There is extensive third-party research available for free and with subscriptions. The research amenities border on overwhelming, but they are also extremely valuable in guiding your trading.\u00a0IBKR is also always expanding this list of amenities. Webull\u2019s research includes a stock screener. That\u2019s pretty much it. The stock screener is not as robust as those of larger brokers, but it does allow you to filter by financial information and some preset indicators. The Webull charting capabilities should work for the majority of average traders. When it comes to research, IBKR is the clear winner. Without tools, calculators, or third-party research, Webull falls substantially behind IBKR. The high-level IBKR portfolio analysis tool serves beginners to institutional investors. The free portfolio analysis tool, which is available to the public, has continued to see major upgrades. IBKR account holders can access advanced features and real-time updates. After linking your financial accounts, you\u2019ll receive in-depth analysis of your entire financial picture, including investment portfolio checkup, total returns, risk measures, and allocations by geography, asset class, and sector. You can also access retirement analysis through this same PortfolioAnalyst tool. There is also a new dashboard that allows you to see real-time analysis of performance across accounts with different charts and tools. Webull falls short on portfolio analysis, offering just the basics. Users have access to account performance details, including realized and unrealized gains or losses as well as capital gains or losses. You\u2019ll also have access to internal rate of return or IRR data. IBKR is better suited for those with more substantial investment portfolios who need comprehensive portfolio analysis tools. Those seeking both a basic and an in-depth investment education will be fulfilled at IBKR. Its vast education resources are available to customers and the public. These range from short videos to multi-language tutorials, daily webinars, and events. IBKR reworked its education offerings in 2023, bringing its well-established Traders Academy into IBKR Campus. This website provides beginner, intermediate, and advanced online courses. The topics range from rudimentary introductions to stocks, indexes, and trading to advanced option strategies and margin. Webull\u2019s investor education is suitable for the typical Webull customer. The short courses include the basics about stocks, ETFs, trading, and options. The learning portal includes several explainer videos and information about how to navigate the platform. The Webull educational offerings are a good start, but lack the depth and breadth of those available at IBKR. Regardless of where you open an account, the IBKR education tools are comprehensive and worth a look. IBKR is improving its customer service.\u00a0 For ready assistance, the artificial intelligence IBot is available from most screens. IBKR also provides phone support 24 hours a day and has a callback service. Live agent online chat is also accessible from within the trading platform or website. Additionally, the FAQ section is well-organized. Webull offers phone customer service during trading hours and an extensive FAQ section. Wait times are known to be long at Webull. In general, IBKR is easier to access via customer service and offers more expansive phone hours and chat features. Security protocols and asset protection at IBKR go above and beyond basic industry standards. Beyond the standard $500,000 Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) coverage, excess SIPC coverage at IBKR provides up to an additional $30 million with a cash sub-limit of $900,000, subject to an aggregate limit of $150 million. Webull also offers industry-beating security protocols, including a discrete six-digit passcode for trading access. Webull's additional SIPC insurance covers account holders up to $37.5 million including $900,000 in cash. The security features at both Webull and IBKR are both excellent. Investors can be comfortable that their data will be protected at either firm. The insurance does not protect investors from losses due to normal market fluctuations but from corporate malfeasance and bankruptcy. Both IBKR and Webull are good investment platforms. In prior years, the larger and older IBKR ran the table for many of our top-rated categories like best broker for advanced options traders, day trading, and international trading. More recently, Webull has received acknowledgment for costs, including best low-cost options broker and best low-cost day trading app. The winner of the contest between Interactive Brokers and Webull comes down to your investment needs. Active investors seeking the widest range of investment assets all under one roof will choose IBKR. Access to bonds, mutual funds, futures, forex, and international trading is rarely found within one company. The range of managed portfolios and international trading further distinguish IBKR. Finally, the TWS platform competes head-to-head with any professional trading software. It is hard to beat Interactive Brokers in its totality. IBKR responds to the breadth of features with many platform-related guides, tutorials, videos, and customer service help to make its platforms more accessible.\u00a0The recent introduction of IBKR Desktop also provides another option for investors who want more but aren't prepared to take on Trader Workstation in full. If you don\u2019t need all the bells and whistles of IBKR, however, and are seeking a streamlined trading platform with low fees, then Webull is a solid choice. The IBKR Lite plan is appropriate for most investors, with affordable fixed pricing for options, futures, and mutual funds, along with commission-free stock and ETF trading. Our main caution with Webull is that beginners might need to visit other sources to get a well-rounded investment education. We do, of course, note the PFOF dependence, but Webull has been transparent on this count and gamification is currently kept to a minimum. Providing readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of online brokers and trading platforms is a top priority for Investopedia. We combined our industry research, subject matter expertise, and investor survey data to guide the research and weightings for our 2024 online broker awards. To collect the data, we sent a digital survey with 110 questions to each of the 26 companies we included in our rubric. Additionally, our team of researchers verified the survey responses and collected any missing data points through online research and conversations with each company directly. The data collection process spanned from Feb. 19 to March 19, 2024. We then developed a proprietary model that scored each company to rate its performance across 11 major categories and 89 criteria to find the best online brokers and trading platforms. The score for each company\u2019s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria in the following categories: Additionally, during our 2024 research, many of the companies we reviewed gave us live demonstrations of their platforms and services via video conferencing methods and also granted our team of expert writers and editors access to live accounts so they could perform hands-on testing. Through this all-encompassing data collection and review process, Investopedia has provided you with an unbiased and thorough review of the top online brokers and trading platforms.

Robinhood and eToro have several things in common. Both are online discount brokers created to provide platforms for everyone to have access to trading without excessive fees. Both brokers also focus on providing simpler self-directed investing by incorporating innovative technology. Finally, both brokers were industry disruptors, with eToro entering the industry in 2007 and Robinhood following a few years later in 2013. There are, of course, important differences beyond this. Robinhood stands out for its IRA retirement accounts, including giving investors up to a 3% match on contributions, a feature unique in the industry. However, eToro has a far larger selection of crypto assets and was our pick as the best broker for cryptocurrency trading. We\u2019ll look deeper at these two trading platforms to help you decide which one is a better fit for your portfolio needs. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\u00a0Take two minutes to learn more.  This article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies nor can the accuracy or timeliness of the information be guaranteed. Both Robinhood and eToro offer streamlined platforms that make it easier for investors of any experience level to find information. Both brokers offer a website and mobile app platform. Robinhood\u2019s platforms have similar layouts and near identical experiences. Investors can customize both platforms and can customize the price charts in each platform. Robinhood has partnered with NASDAQ to provide investors with access to real-time streaming stock quotes on both of its platforms. Robinhood has significantly upgraded its charting capabilities, something long-demanded by users. New chart features include moving averages, allowing investors to better analyze stock trends. eToro also offers customizable advanced charting tools. These charts allow you to apply technical studies and use common drawing tools, putting eToro\u2019s charting capabilities ahead of Robinhood. Investors can benefit from eToro\u2019s Smart Portfolios tool, a form of automated investing using a \u201cpredetermined strategy,\u201d as well as CopyTrader, which is a tool that lets investors mimic the strategies and portfolios of more experienced traders. The platform\u2019s News Feed allows traders to share their market insights so other investors can decide whether to copy them. Robinhood and eToro both have user-friendly platforms. However, eToro leads in this category because its users have access to more robust features in the mobile app and website platforms, especially given the unique social trading elements. Robinhood and eToro have streamlined website platforms. Both brokers keep things simple for their users and do not provide a robust collection of advanced research and trading tools. However, eToro provides features that Robinhood does not, such as a trading journal, access to proprietary research, and access to international exchanges. eToro is a leader in online social investing and has some interesting features for investors, like One-Click Trading, which allows traders to quickly open positions with preset parameters. These more advanced features make eToro the winner in this category. Both eToro and Robinhood are strong choices for investors who favor user-friendly mobile trading platforms. eToro\u2019s social feel is highlighted through the mobile design. eToro\u2019s mobile users have access to a drawing tool in the charting feature, but Robinhood lacks in this area by not offering a drawing tool in either platform. Robinhood also does not allow trades to be executed directly from charts. There are some areas where eToro and Robinhood tie. Both brokers\u2019 mobile apps support the same order types and provide access to the same asset classes as the website platforms. Additionally, both brokers\u2019 mobile platforms provide real-time streaming stock quotes and real-time portfolio reports. Overall, Robinhood and eToro have all the features in their mobile app platforms to meet the needs of new and passive investors. However, more active traders may prefer eToro\u2019s mobile platform due to the availability of more tools. Robinhood offerings include stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), options, cryptocurrencies, fractional share trading for stocks and ETFs, fractional cryptocurrency trading, and a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) for stock and ETF dividends. Robinhood offers the Robinhood Cash Card (debit card) and a web3 wallet for customers who want to store their digital assets, including NFTs.\u00a0eToro\u2019s offerings include stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, options, fractional share trading, the eToro Money account, a crypto wallet, and automated investing through Smart Portfolios. eToro has a larger selection of available cryptocurrencies than Robinhood. Robinhood and eToro have limited offerings in comparison to other brokers. Neither offers mutual funds, forex, or futures trading. Neither Robinhood nor eToro allows short selling, but Robinhood offers a margin account. Robinhood also offers IRA and Roth IRA retirement accounts, while eToro does not. Robinhood matches annual IRA contributions up to 3% to encourage users to deposit more money. The winner in this category depends on what someone is looking for. Robinhood\u2019s range of offerings is better for investors saving for retirement, while eToro is better for crypto investing. Robinhood\u2019s order types are based on the asset class. Limit, market, stop, and stop limit orders are available for cryptocurrencies. Limit, stop limit, and market orders are available for options. Market, limit, stop, stop-limit, and trailing stop orders are available for stocks. Some stocks can be placed as good-for-day (GFD) or good-til-canceled (GTC) orders. Robinhood also offers a 24-hour market for select stocks and ETFs. You can set up limit orders when markets are closed and pick the time when the app will try to execute them using your set limit price. eToro provides the basic order types such as market, limit, stop loss, and take profit. Additionally, eToro offers One-Click Trading with predetermined factors such as leverage, take profit, and stop loss. Robinhood edges out eToro in this category due to the availability of more order options. Robinhood is continuing to provide new and improved trading tools to meet customers' needs. Some examples include charting tools and a web3 wallet platform for advanced cryptocurrency trading. Both Robinhood and eToro receive payment for order flow (PFOF). eToro has an agreement with Apex Clearing, which handles the order routing and discloses PFOF that was on the low end when we evaluated it\u2014although it is hard to know what is specific to eToro flow. Robinhood publicly discloses its order execution quality statistics. It reported that 95.18% of orders were executed at the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) or better in the third quarter of 2024. Both eToro and Robinhood offer a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) and fractional share trading on all platforms. In terms of innovation, eToro offers CopyTrader and Smart Portfolios, which are somewhat automated features that allow users to copy other investors\u2019 investing behaviors and choose options from portfolios that are already diversified. These are the closest options to having a robo-advisor. As an added benefit, eToro has a dedicated team that monitors the portfolio's performances and assists with other actions, such as rebalancing. eToro offers users the ability to customize charts, a trading journal, and some screening tools. Neither broker offers backtesting features. This category is a tie. Depending on what is most important to investors, either broker could meet their needs. Both brokers provide commission-free stocks, options, and ETFs. eToro charges a 1% commission for cryptocurrencies, whereas Robinhood does not charge commissions for cryptocurrencies. Robinhood\u2019s margin rate is 6.00%, and Gold subscribers get a lower rate. eToro does not have a traditional margin account, although leverage can be accessed on certain investments for a fee. eToro requires a minimum investment of $200 to use the CopyTrader feature. Robinhood provides more cost savings for investors and therefore is the leader in this category. Both Robinhood and eToro are lacking in this area in comparison to the advanced tools provided by other brokers. Platform research features that are available to investors are user-friendly but limited. eToro does not provide calculators or trading idea generators besides its CopyTrader system. New Robinhood investors can receive a first Trade recommendation for a portfolio of ETFs. However, Robinhood does not provide trading ideas or calculators beyond that. Robinhood does not offer proprietary research. Robinhood Gold users do gain access to Morningstar in-depth stock research reports, though it costs $5 per month to join Robinhood Gold. On the other hand, eToro offers its customers free proprietary and third-party research information. Both brokers offer investors daily market reports. While both brokers offer screeners and watchlists, eToro\u2019s are more comprehensive. For example, eToro offers stock and ETF screeners, while Robinhood only offers a stock screener. eToro wins in this category for providing slightly more research amenities for free. Robinhood and eToro both have limited portfolio analysis tools. Robinhood offers a sector allocation monitor, which is a portfolio tracking feature. When it comes to portfolio reports, both brokers offer these reports to investors in all platforms. Neither broker offers backtesting strategy features. Other than normal access to daily balances, positions, etc., there are no advanced analysis tools. In this category, Robinhood and eToro tie. Robinhood has been working to expand its educational resources. Robinhood Learn is a library of investing education including the basics of investing, various investing terms, financial literacy, taxes, entrepreneurship, and more. Robinhood Learn content is in the form of articles, videos, and in-app course modules. Additionally, Robinhood offers its customers a three-minute read newsletter called Robinhood Snacks that is emailed to subscribers weekly. Robinhood also runs a podcast. eToro Academy is eToro\u2019s free online investing education platform. On this platform, customers can find educational information on various financial topics and additional insight on some of eToro\u2019s trading tools. It covers material for both beginner and advanced investors. eToro also provides a free Virtual Demo account, where investors can test strategies and learn using play money. This category is a tie, given that both companies provide a variety of educational materials. Limited direct access to customer service is an issue for both Robinhood and eToro. Both brokers offer a Help Center containing answers to common questions on their website and mobile platforms. Only current Robinhood customers have direct access to customer service, which is available after logging into their accounts on the website or mobile platforms. Robinhood upport is available through a 24/7 live chat and by telephone from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET, but only via the in-app callback feature. eToro offers visitors an option to open a customer service request ticket on the website. While both companies could be better, Robinhood has a slight edge thanks to its 24/7 live chat and available phone support. Robinhood and eToro both offer two-factor authentication, encryption, and biometric logins on all trading platforms. Robinhood and eToro customer assets are protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) for up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for cash). Transparency has previously been an issue for current and prospective customers for Robinhood due to an outage on both platforms in March 2020 and a data security breach on Nov. 3, 2021. eToro edges out Robinhood in this category with no reported outages or data security breaches. New and passive investors seeking streamlined, simple platforms will most likely be satisfied with either Robinhood or eToro. Both Robinhood and eToro will appeal to investors who prefer mobile investing because both brokers' mobile app platforms offer the same features as their website platforms. Robinhood is the better choice for investors saving for retirement.\u00a0It offers both IRA and Roth IRA retirement accounts, including up to a 3% matching contribution when users deposit money. eToro does not have retirement accounts. Robinhood also has a slight edge on cost savings as it does not charge commissions on any trades. eToro is better for crypto investing thanks to its wide selection of cryptocurrencies. eToro has slightly more trading capabilities, including the ability to mimic the portfolios of successful investors using its CopyTrader system. Still, neither eToro nor Robinhood is meant for serious day traders. Both are geared toward beginner, passive, and cost-conscious investors. This group would find either broker an appealing, affordable choice. Providing readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of online brokers and trading platforms is a top priority for Investopedia.

In addition to its cryptocurrency trading offering, eToro also allows you to invest in stocks, ETFs, and other securities, with the number and types of assets depending on your location. U.S. citizens can trade 3 digital currencies and tokens, over 3,500 stocks, more than 290 ETFs, and options contracts on a range of assets. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\u00a0Take 2 minutes to learn more.  This article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies, nor can the accuracy or timeliness of the information be guaranteed. eToro was founded in 2007 as a forex trading platform in Tel Aviv by brothers Ronen Assia and Yoni Assia and co-founder David Ring. In 2010, eToro launched its flagship social trading feature that allows users to copy the trades of successful traders on the platform. Next, in 2013, eToro added stock trading to its forex and commodity trading offering and became one of the first brokers to support Bitcoin (BTC). In 2017, eToro expanded its crypto trading business by adding more assets and entered the U.S. market with its crypto trading offering the following year. Today, eToro enables its more than 25 million customers from 140 countries to trade a variety of assets, including crypto, stock, ETFs, and more, making it one of the most popular online trading platforms in the world. On September 12, 2024, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that eToro is ceasing trading for nearly all crypto assets. The announcement comes after eToro reached a settlement with the SEC for charges that the trading platform operated an unregistered brokerage and clearing agency related to its crypto dealings. eToro has also agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle with the SEC, in addition to limiting its cryptocurrency offering to just Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ether for U.S. consumers. U.S. customers holding cryptocurrency no longer offered by eToro will be able to sell their cryptocurrency for up to 180 days. Established, global platform Innovative and easy-to-use social trading experience Only available in 47 U.S. states Margin trading not available in the U.S. Lacks advanced trading tools and features eToro has a straightforward, simple user interface that makes it easy for traders to find what they\u2019re looking for. The mobile app and web-based user experience provide similar functions and features, so users can seamlessly transition to trade through their preferred version. eToro\u2019s flagship CopyTrader feature allows you to quickly and easily search for and copy the crypto trades of popular traders on the platform, making it incredibly easy to get started. The platform\u2019s News Feed highlights eToro\u2019s social trading network aspect, providing a social media-like experience, with users sharing their insights on what\u2019s happening in the markets. That enables users to get to know the thought process behind many of the successful traders on the platform, making the choice of whether to copy these traders a lot easier. eToro provides a streamlined onboarding process with a self-guided questionnaire that asks for some personal information to help set up your account. The platform supports a wide variety of financial institutions that you can link up to eToro to make deposits into your account. Getting up and running doesn\u2019t take long and you can start trading quickly. It is also easy to set up an eToro Options account, which lets you trade options in the eToro Options app. On the eToro platform, a \u201cTrading\u201d tab lets you view prices and buy, sell, or convert crypto, ETFs, or stocks. Prices are provided in real time. eToro offers 3 cryptocurrencies, over 3,500 stocks, and more than 290 ETFs, covering the most important assets and securities. However, its list of tradable assets is not as vast as some of its peers. Additionally, users won\u2019t find many order types beyond basic market and limit orders, which prevents more advanced traders from getting the most out of the system. The flagship CopyTrader and Popular Investor Program features are arguably the highlights of the platform, enabling users to copy the trades of successful traders while the most successful traders earn rewards when their trades are being copied. These offerings, combined with the site's interactive nature, can make the user experience feel more akin to a social media platform than a traditional brokerage service. Custom watchlists can be synced between the mobile and web platforms, allowing users to keep track of their interests regardless of which version they use to access eToro. Watchlists can be customized to add volatility alerts that send notifications directly to your phone. eToro\u2019s mobile app is user-friendly, with a simple, uncluttered design. The beginner-friendly user interface combined with the feel of a social media app makes for an innovative, creative user experience. The app is built with interactive functionality so you can engage with other traders and navigate to popular investor profiles. Beginner investors may feel more comfortable with the app\u2019s familiar feel since eToro is not modeled on other traditional brokerage offerings. Experienced traders looking to execute orders without the social feel may find eToro to be a bit of an adjustment, but overall the mobile app is very intuitive. eToro provides a much wider range of offerings on international versions of the experience. The U.S. platform has very limited offerings compared to competitors. There are no mutual funds, futures contracts, or forex on eToro's U.S. platform, and all trading is limited to long positions only\u2014there is no short selling. On eToro U.S., you have access to: Despite\u00a0the sharp increase in volatility\u00a0that rocked the U.S. equity market from mid July through Early August, Investopedia's latest Reader Survey\u00a0shows that most individual investors remain somewhat optimistic about their portfolios. eToro only offers a narrow range of order types on its platform. They include market order, limit order, stop-loss order, and take-profit order. eToro doesn\u2019t disclose order execution quality statistics, but it has a best execution policy and has a very low level of payment for order flow, suggesting that the broker follows it. eToro\u2019s Smart Portfolios lets you select from diversified automated portfolios so you don\u2019t have to allocate your money yourself. You can invest in a wide variety of portfolios that focus on everything from private equity and infrastructure to technology and health care while blending the allocation of ETFs, stocks, and cryptocurrency. An investment team monitors the portfolio offerings to ensure that they continue to match thematic elements and risk parameters. These portfolios are particularly appealing to beginner investors. The trading technology associated with ETF, stock, and crypto trading is relatively straightforward. Charting capability is included with all asset types, but no backtesting capabilities are included on the platform. Beyond that, screening tools and other more robust trading functionalities are largely absent. The CopyTrader product and social trading element remain the focus of eToro\u2019s trading experience. eToro's fees are in line with most other online brokerages and crypto trading platforms. eToro makes money by taking the difference between bid and ask prices. This practice is a typical way for brokers to price trades and collect fees, even if a platform notes fee-free or commission-free trading. eToro\u2019s beginner-friendly platform enables users to search for and filter assets on its trading dashboard. Stock investors have the option of a simple stock screener, while crypto traders can browse from a menu of available coins or view portfolios of other investors and decide whether to use the CopyTrader feature to automatically copy popular traders. eToro lacks many of the tools, calculators, and detailed trading functionality that most sophisticated investors would find necessary to carry out advanced trading techniques. eToro offers a simple stock screening tool that allows you to filter stocks by a range of criteria. The platform also offers a volatility tracker where you can view the biggest movers. While users can sift through a list of eToro\u2019s available ETFs based on proprietary social inputs, there is no option to customize their search with helpful technical or fundamental indicators. Currently, there are no mutual fund screener tools are available, as this asset class is not offered on the platform. Currently, eToro does not offer the ability to screen option contracts. No crypto screener tools are available. Only the biggest movers of the day and trending assets are highlighted on the platform. Currently, there are no fixed income screener tools are available, as this asset class is not offered on the platform. eToro has no tools or calculators of note. Goal and financial planning tools are not offered. eToro provides charting capabilities through a professional-grade technical tool, ProCharts. This charting feature helps you analyze an asset\u2019s history and performance by providing line, bar, and candle charts. ProCharts also lets you view two or more charts on the same screen, enabling you to compare their performance. ProChart users can filter their data by time interval or price. Some more sophisticated tools are available from the chart screen as well, including Fibonacci retracement and accumulative swing index. Users can place trades directly from the desktop chart. CopyTrader provides the extent of trading idea generators at eToro. Users can search for, follow, and copy trades of investors that match their interests and goals. This feature is only available for crypto. eToro\u2019s news feed is mainly composed of other eToro users\u2019 analysis, thoughts, and insights, highlighting the social trading network\u2019s social media-esque look and feel. eToro\u2019s third-party research is powered by TipRanks, a leading source for up-to-date recommendations from professional analysts at investment banks and financial companies from around the world. Although eToro has fractional investing, dividends paid out on the platform are not automatically reinvested in your portfolio. eToro credits payment to your cash balance if you hold a position in a stock or ETF that pays dividends. eToro offers cash management through eToro Money, which enables you to seamlessly deposit and withdraw funds to and from your eToro account. You can also use it to send and receive money and store cryptocurrency.\u00a0 Additionally, users can earn 4.15% annual interest on their cash through eToro\u2019s High Interest Cash Program. Beyond that, eToro\u2019s cash management solution doesn\u2019t provide any further banking-related service to customers in the U.S. eToro provides limited portfolio analysis, especially in comparison to competitor platforms. While you can see current balances and positions clearly, not much exists in the way of further analysis outside of charting features. eToro\u2019s charting capabilities are adequate but give you a better sense of performance as opposed to helping you see where portfolio changes might be needed. Investopedia's latest Reader Survey\u00a0shows that, despite concerns about the election, inflation, and extended valuations, individual stocks remain survey respondents' the top investment choice if they had an extra $10,000 to spend. An online educational portal is accessible through eToro Academy. While many of the articles provide information on cryptocurrency, other materials focus on products like the Smart Portfolio and trading strategies like technical indicators. A filter lets you quickly toggle the educational library between beginner and advanced material so that you can customize the experience to your skill level. A variety of educational formats are available as well, with long-form articles and videos as options. eToro provides a help center that has a large volume of FAQ articles that address a range of potential inquiries. Outside of this self-serve option, more traditional customer support options are limited. Phone and email support is available, but the contact information is not readily available for you to find. Chat functionality is provided through the help center so you can chat directly with an agent. You can also open a support ticket online. In addition to SIPC insurance, eToro's clearing partner, Apex, also added supplemental insurance, protecting eToro customers with up to $37.5 million in securities and $900,000 in cash per individual. A digital wallet, known as the eToro Wallet, is provided by eToro to store cryptocurrency. Users can transfer cryptocurrency from eToro\u2019s platform to their own digital wallet, but they should note that coin transfers are one-way\u2014which means any coins transferred can\u2019t be transferred back to the eToro trading platform. eToro generally has a transparent platform in terms of pricing but is lacking when it comes to execution statistics. Crypto pricing is explicitly laid out at 1% of all trades. There are no fees for stock and ETF trading, although some ETFs may carry additional expenses on their own. Spread pricing and payment for order flow (PFOF) information is available as well. The inability of users to transfer coins from the wallet back to the eToro trading platform may not be immediately obvious to clients. Individual brokerage and options accounts are the only types of accounts that can be opened with eToro in the U.S. Joint accounts, retirement accounts, trust accounts, and custodial accounts are not available. Just as notable, eToro doesn\u2019t support margin accounts. This aspect can be a severely limiting factor for users looking to open accounts that are better suited for a wide variety of goals. eToro is one of the most established online brokerages offering crypto trading services in the United States. The user-friendly interface and platform\u2019s CopyTrader and SmartPortfolios features further expand on the beginner-friendliness of the platform, making the crypto asset market more accessible for newcomers. In addition to crypto trading, eToro users can also invest in stocks, ETFs, and options, providing a suite of products to choose from. However, the list of tradable assets across all supported asset classes is not as long as at some eToro\u2019s competitors. Moreover, the lack of advanced trading tools, in-depth research, and margin trading makes eToro less suitable for experienced traders looking to deploy advanced trading strategies. eToro is best suited for beginners and less experienced traders looking to trade the most popular cryptocurrencies (and other assets) as well as make use of the platform\u2019s flagship copy trading feature. However, advanced traders looking to trade cryptocurrency may want to look at popular crypto exchanges to fulfill their crypto needs. To buy bitcoin on eToro in the United States, you need to sign up for an account on eToro.com, verify your identity to pass the customer onboarding process, link your bank card to your account to transfer funds, and then purchase bitcoin with the funds you have deposited on the eToro platform. The purchased BTC will then be held on your eToro account, but you can also transfer it to eToro\u2019s official crypto wallet, eToro Wallet. eToro is a licensed online brokerage company with an excellent track record for security. The company\u2019s U.S.-based securities business, under the entity eToro USA Securities Inc., is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and FINRA. eToro\u2019s U.S.-based cryptocurrency business, operating under the entity eToro USA LLC, is a registered Money Services Business (MSB) with FinCEN. Moreover, the company has not reported any major security breaches on its platform. Providing readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of online brokers and trading platforms is a top priority for Investopedia. We combined our industry research, subject matter expertise, and investor survey data to guide the research and weightings for our 2024 online broker awards. To collect the data, we sent a digital survey with 110 questions to each of the 26 companies we included in our rubric.

            "title": "The Top 5 Ways to Hedge Against Inflation",
            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. coward_lion\u00a0/ Getty Images Inflation is defined by the rate at which the value of a currency is falling and, consequently, the general level of prices for goods and services is rising. Inflation is a natural occurrence in an economy, but inflation hedging can be used to offset the anticipated drop in a currency's price, thus protecting the decreased purchasing power. Inflation hedging can also help protect the value of an investment. Although certain investments may seem to provide a decent return, they can be sold at a loss when inflation is factored in. A disciplined investor can plan for inflation by cultivating asset classes that outperform the market during inflationary climates. Although traditional bonds are the usual go-to for the income-oriented, they aren't the only investment that produces a revenue stream. Here are the top five asset classes to consider when seeking protection from inflation. They range from equities to debt instruments to alternative investments. All are feasible moves for the individual investor to make, though they carry different degrees of risk. If inflation returns, it's generally a punch in the jaw for the bond market, but it could be a shot in the arm for the stock market. Consider reallocating 10% of your portfolio from bonds to equities in order to take advantage of this possible trend. A 60/40 stock/bond portfolio is considered to be a safe, conservative mix of stocks and bonds. An example of a stock/bond portfolio is the Dimensional DFA Global Allocation 60/40 Portfolio (I) (DGSIX). A 60/40 stock/bond portfolio is an easy investment strategy and will help you hedge against inflation, but keep in mind it will underperform over the long term compared to an all-equity portfolio because of the effects of compounding interest. You may find yourself missing out on returns compared to a portfolio with a higher percentage of stocks. Buying preferred stocks is another possibility. These liquid issues will pay a higher yield than most types of bonds and may not decline in price as much as bonds when inflation appears. Utility stocks represent a third alternative, where the price of the stock will rise and fall in a somewhat predictable fashion through the economic cycle and also pay steady dividends. American investors tend to lean towards stocks and bonds in the U.S., but the practice can be costly over the long term, especially during times of inflation. Increasing international exposure can be a good strategy to hedge against inflation. Several major economies in the world do not rise and fall in tandem with the U.S. market indices, such as Italy, Australia, and South Korea. Adding stocks from these or other similar countries can help hedge your portfolio against domestic economic cycles. Bonds from foreign issuers can provide investors with exposure to fixed income that may not drop in price if inflation appears on the home front. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are two of the easiest options to diversify investments into international markets. These types of funds are a low-cost way to invest, compared to purchasing a portfolio of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) or foreign stocks. If you hold S&P 500 index funds, you may want to consider adding an international index fund to your portfolio. There are many advantages to investing in real estate. This asset class has intrinsic value and provides consistent income through dividends. It often acts as a good inflation hedge since there will always be a demand for homes, regardless of the economic climate, and because as inflation rises, so do property values, and therefore the amount a landlord can charge for rent. Because real estate is a tangible asset, however, it's illiquid. An alternative to consider is real estate investment trusts (REITs), which are more liquid investments and can be bought and sold easily in the markets. REITs are companies that own and operate portfolios of commercial, residential, and industrial properties. Providing income through rents and leases, they often pay higher yields than bonds. Another key advantage is that their prices probably won\u2019t be as affected when rates start to rise, because their operating costs are going to remain largely unchanged. An example of a REIT with broad exposure to real estate and a low expense ratio is the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ). Many of these investments are complex instruments, and novice investors may be wise to buy them through a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF). For example: Treasury inflation-protected securities\u00a0(TIPS) are a type of U.S. Treasury bond, designed to increase in value in order to keep pace with inflation. Because they\u2019re backed by the U.S. federal government, they\u2019re considered among the safest investments in the world. The bonds are linked to the Consumer Price Index and their principal amount is reset according to changes in this index. TIPS pay interest twice a year at a fixed rate, which is applied to the adjusted principal. The principal rises when there is inflation and falls when there is deflation. TIPS come in three maturities: five-year, 10-year, and 30-year. There are however a few risks that come with TIPS. They are sensitive to any change in the current interest rates, so if you sell your investment before maturity, you may lose some money. TIPS' yields dropped in value in the secondary market considerably after 2018 but rose sharply in 2022 and 2023 as high inflation hit the economy, with yields surpassing 2018 levels. Some businesses can thrive during inflation when prices are rising. Banks, for example, earn more money as interest rates rise and profit off the increased price of loans. Buying senior secured bank loans is a good way to earn higher yields while protecting yourself from a price drop if rates start to rise. Keep in mind, though, that there may be a substantial time lag until the value of loans increases as the rates rise. An example fund of this type is the Lord Abbett Floating Rate Fund (LFRAX). The best hedge against inflation, historically, depends on\u00a0your time frame. Commodities are often cited as a good bet for keeping up with the cost of living\u2014especially gold. However, research by Duke University professor Campbell Harvey and Claude Erb, former commodities and fixed income manager at TCW Group, shows that gold works best as an inflation hedge only over the very long term\u2014a century or more. Many analysts and economists feel equities are a better way to protect your portfolio over the long term, particularly against an unexpected flare-up of inflation. Corporate earnings often grow faster when inflation is higher because this indicates people are spending and the economy is growing. While it has its ups and downs, over the past 100 years, the stock market (as represented by the S&P 500) has appreciated an average of 10% annually. One of gold's traditional selling points has been its status as an inflation hedge. As an actual, tangible asset, gold tends to hold its value for the most part\u2014unlike paper currencies like the dollar, which lose purchasing power\u00a0when inflation is rampant. With rising inflation, gold typically appreciates. However, gold isn't a perfect inflation hedge. Other factors can drive its prices, which can fluctuate wildly from year to year\u2014which means its inflation-adjusted returns can too. In fact, over the last 1-, 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-year investment horizons, the variation in the nominal and real returns of gold has not been driven by realized inflation. Theoretically, Bitcoin could be a strong inflation hedge. Assets that investors run to in times of rising prices\u2014so-called safe-haven investments like precious metals and real estate\u2014are ones that are scarce or move counter to paper money or financial assets. Bitcoin fits the bill. The problem is that Bitcoin hasn't much of an investment history: Created in 2009, it's only been actively traded for a decade or so, and inflation hasn't been much of a factor for most of its short life. So no one really knows how inflation will affect Bitcoin and its characteristically volatile behavior. Certainly, its performance has been puzzling vis-a-vis inflation post-COVID. Bitcoin doubled from mid-December 2020 to early January 2021, as inflation started to heat up. But then, with no apparent easing of inflationary pressures, between Jan. 8 and Jan. 11, it lost 25% of its value. In May 2021, inflation talk intensified: As the Federal Reserve signaled a retreat from easy-money pandemic policies and a rise in interest rates, stocks trembled\u2014but Bitcoin really tumbled. On May 19, it culminated a month-long slide by closing at $38,390\u2014a 41% decline from its peak of $64,829 in mid-April. In 2022, as inflation skyrocketed and the Fed increased rates to combat it, Bitcoin dropped drastically throughout the year, ending the year at around $23,100. In 2023, with inflation easing but rates on the rise, Bitcoin began ascending, closing out 2023 at $42,500. In 2024, with inflation easing further, Bitcoin continued its ascent to approximately $90,000 by November. Real estate is one of the time-honored inflation hedges. It's a tangible asset, and those tend to hold their value when inflation reigns, unlike paper assets. More specifically, as prices rise, so do property values, and so does the amount a landlord can charge for rent so that the property earns higher rental income over time. There's also the phenomenon of \u201cdepreciating debt\u201d: that is, the cost of the real estate owner\u2019s mortgage payments actually declines. For example, say your mortgage payments add up to a fixed $8,333 per month during the first year of your loan. They will remain the same nominally\u2014$100,000 annually\u2014but may well only be worth $80,000 in the 10th year if there's been sustained inflation during that period. All these elements make real estate valuable protection in inflationary times. Inflation happens and is a risk every investor faces. Money tends to lose value over time, and also the level of inflation in an economy changes depending on current events. There are, however, many ways for investors to hedge against inflation, including some investments and inflation-hedged asset classes designed specifically for that purpose. Keeping these assets on your watch list, and acquiring them when inflation hits, can help your portfolio thrive despite the economic climate.

            "title": "5 Key Investment Strategies to Learn Before Trading",
            "content": "Choosing a Stock Market Strategy That Fits Your Portfolio Objectives and Skills skynesher / Getty Images An investment strategy is a set of principles that guides your portfolio decisions. With seemingly countless theories and approaches on offer, from simplistic learn-this-one-trick TikToks to dense tomes seemingly only for financial doctorates, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and uncertain about where to start. But don't worry: successful investing doesn't require a finance degree, complicated math skills, or a TikTok account. However, by focusing on a few key investment strategies, even beginning traders can lay a solid foundation for long-term success in the market. The truth is many successful investors use straightforward strategies that anyone can learn. These time-tested approaches help you make smarter choices about where to put your money and how to manage risk\u2014kind of like having guardrails on a set of stairs. We rounded up a group of great advisors to help us explore five key investment strategies every aspiring trader should learn before entering the market. We begin with a series of questions to answer to determine your strategy. Then, from value and growth investing to dollar-cost averaging, we'll break down the core principles and advantages of each, giving you a clear understanding of how they work and when to apply them. At the end, we have a questionnaire you can use to help you decide on which strategy is best for you. Before choosing an investment strategy, it's important to gather some basic information about your finances. Let's get you started with these important strategic questions: Even though you don't need much money to start, you shouldn't begin investing until you can afford to do so. If you have debts or other obligations, consider the impact investing will have on your short-term cash flow before you start putting money into your portfolio. Most advisors recommend paying down your debts and having a three-to-six-month emergency fund before socking significant amounts away in an investment portfolio. As you build toward getting ready to trade, you should sort out how much you can afford to put into your stock market account. Next, set out your objectives. Everyone has different needs, so you should determine yours. Are you saving for retirement? Are you looking to make major purchases like a home or car? Are you saving for your or your children's education? Answering these questions will help you narrow down a strategy since each approach requires different levels of liquidity, opportunities, and risk. Ensure you can afford to invest before you start putting money away. Prioritize paying off high-interest debt, for example, before setting money aside for the future. Next, figure out your risk tolerance. Financial advisors typically have a set of questions to determine their clients. Some are quantitative: your age, income, and how long you have until retirement. Younger investors have time on their side to recuperate losses, so it's often recommended that younger investors hold more risk than those who are older. However, some questions to determine your risk tolerance are qualitative and personal. \"Psychological components play a large factor in clients\u2019 tolerance toward risk,\" Nate Creviston, manager of wealth management and portfolio analysis at Capital Advisors in Shaker Heights, Ohio, told us. \"Simply put, some are more comfortable taking risks if they know that mathematically, over long periods, they will outperform others who aren\u2019t comfortable taking on risks. However, risk-averse clients aren\u2019t wrong. They deserve to have a portfolio tailored to their comfortability and goals.\" People who grew up in the same home and have very similar experiences and income can have very different reactions to specific financial situations. How would you feel if your investments dropped 30% overnight? How would you react if your portfolio is worth $1,000 less today than yesterday? Sometimes, the best strategy for making money could make you deeply uncomfortable. Your investment strategy will need to align with where your comfort level ultimately is. Relatedly, you'll need to handle the ups and downs of the market. Alyson Claire Basso, a managing principal of Hayden Wealth Management in Middleton, Massachusetts, told us she makes it a point \"to discuss past market experiences and potential future market volatility. This way, [clients] feel prepared and know that volatility is something we\u2019ve planned for.\" This discipline is important when thinking about investment strategies. \"We talk about their financial goals and how sticking to their plan can help them ride out the rough patches. I also remind them that diversified investing helps spread risk, so they're not putting all their eggs in one basket,\" Basso said. Once you've answered the strategic questions above, you'll want to learn the basics of investing: how to read stock charts, etc., and then begin picking some of your favorite companies and analyzing their financial statements. You'll also need to keep up to date with recent news about industries you're interested in investing in. It's a good idea to understand what you're getting into so you're not investing mindlessly. Risk isn't necessarily bad in investing. Higher-risk investments are often rewarded with higher returns. \"A holistic financial plan balances threats, opportunities, risks, and rewards,\" said Neil R. Waxman, a managing director of Capital Advisors in Shaker Heights, Ohio. Waxman emphasized the importance of understanding how risks and rewards can be balanced while providing cash flow to those who need it. \"A client who understands these connections and has a clear game plan\" will have \"the perspective and vision needed to be a patient investor.\" Passive index investing has gained significant popularity since the introduction of passive index-based mutual funds in the 1970s and then similar ETFs in 1993. Unlike actively managed funds, where an individual or team makes decisions on the underlying assets in an attempt to beat the market, passive mutual funds and ETFs track an index like the S&P 500; they don't work to beat the market so much as match it. Since the S&P 500, an index of the 500 largest publicly traded American companies, has been up over time, this has been a winning strategy for many investors. Above is a chart of the percentage of large-cap domestic equity funds that have underperformed the S&P 500 since 2001: In addition, the hands-off approach means fund managers charge lower fees given the less work required vs. active management. The passive investing strategy has the benefit of lower turnover. When assets move in and out of the fund at a slower pace, it results in fewer transaction costs and realized capital gains, which can lead to potential savings when tax filing season arrives. Lower costs because of minimal trading, research, and management fees Simplicity and ease of implementation through passive funds Broad diversification across multiple sectors Potential for long-term growth in line with the market Greater flexibility for investors to execute a buy-and-hold strategy Can't outperform the market Exposure to market downturns and volatility Missed opportunities in specific sectors or regions Reliance on the performance of the underlying index or sector Potential for tracking errors (lack of a perfect match in performance) between the fund and the underlying index  Passive index investing can be a great choice for beginner investors starting to explore the stock market. It's an ideal entry point for those who may feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the financial markets. Investing in index funds or ETFs that track broad market indexes allows you to gain exposure to a diverse range of companies and sectors without the need for extensive research or stock-picking skills. Passive investing isn't just a rookie move: experienced investors also invest heavily in such funds, which now make up about half of all volume traded in mutual funds and ETFs combined. Long-term investors benefit greatly from passive index investing, particularly those saving for retirement or other distant goals. The buy-and-hold nature of passive index investing allows investors to ride out short-term market fluctuations and benefit from the power of compound growth over time. In addition, the lower fees of passive investing can lead to significant savings over time. There's long-term opportunity for large gains as market prices meet up with a company's true intrinsic value. Value companies often have stronger risk/reward relationships. Value investing is rooted in fundamental analysis and supported by financial metrics. Value companies are more likely to issue dividends as they aren't as reliant on cash for growth. Value companies are often hard to find. Successful value investments take time, and investors must be more patient. Even after holding long-term, there's no guarantee of success since the company may even be in worse shape than before. Investing only in sectors that are underperforming decreases your portfolio's diversification. Value investors are your bargain shoppers of the investing world. They look for stocks with prices they believe don\u2019t reflect the security's intrinsic value. Value investing is premised, in part, on the idea that some degree of irrationality exists in the market. This irrationality, in theory, presents prospects to get a stock at a discounted price and make money from it. It\u2019s not necessary for value investors to comb through volumes of financial data to find deals. Thousands of value mutual funds and ETFs offer shares in baskets of stocks thought to be undervalued. For example, the Russell 1000 Value Index is a popular benchmark for value investors, and several mutual funds track this index. For those who don\u2019t have time to perform exhaustive research, the price-earnings ratio (P/E) is an often-used measure for quickly identifying undervalued or cheap stocks. The metric derives from dividing a stock\u2019s share price by its earnings per share (EPS). For a nuanced guide to using the P/E ratio to evaluate stocks, see Investopedia's Are Stocks With Low P/E Ratios Always Better? Value investors seek companies with a low P/E ratio; a lower P/E ratio means you\u2019re paying less per dollar of current earnings. Value investing is best for investors looking to hold their securities long-term. If you're investing in value companies, it may take years (or longer) for the businesses to scale up. Value investing focuses on the big picture and often attempts to approach investing with a gradual growth mindset. People often cite legendary investor Warren Buffett, who is the epitome of a value investor. Consider Buffett\u2019s words when he made a substantial investment in the airline industry. He explained that airlines \"had a bad first century.\" Then he said, \"And they got that century out of the way\u2014I hope.\" This illustrates much of the value investing approach: choices are based on decades of trends and with decades of future performance in mind. A rich set of academic studies has found that value investing can produce superior returns over the long term. However, value investing has had periods where it has underperformed growth investing, especially when tech stocks have posted outsized price gains. Rather than look for low-cost deals, growth investors want investments that offer strong upside potential for future earnings. It could be said that a growth investor is often looking for the \u201cnext big thing.\u201d However, this strategy isn't a reckless embrace of speculative investing. Instead, it involves evaluating a company's health and potential to grow. A drawback to growth investing is a lack of dividends. When a company is growing, it often needs capital to sustain its expansion. This doesn\u2019t leave much (or any) cash left for dividends. Moreover, with faster earnings growth comes higher valuations, which are, for most investors, a higher risk proposition. While there is no definitive list of hard metrics to guide a growth strategy, there are a few factors an investor should consider. Growth stocks tend to do comparatively well during periods of falling interest rates, as newer companies find it less expensive to borrow to fuel their expansion. It's essential to keep in mind, however, that at the first sign of a downturn in the economy, growth stocks are often the first to get hit. Growth investors also need to carefully consider the management of a business\u2019s executive team. Achieving growth is among the most difficult challenges for a firm. Therefore, a stellar leadership team is required. You'll also need to evaluate the competition. A company may enjoy stellar growth, but if its primary product is easily replicated, the long-term prospects are dim. Potentially quicker profits: If you make profits, it'll usually be quicker than value stocks. Growth is sudden: Once growth begin, these companies often experience the sharpest and greatest stock price increases. Less need for fundamental analysis: Growth investing doesn't rely as heavily on fundamental analysis, making it easier for some to begin. Momentum is your friend: Growth companies can often be boosted by momentum; once growth begins, future periods of continued growth (and stock appreciation) are more likely. Volatility: Growth stocks are often more volatile. Good times are good, but if a company isn't growing, its stock price will suffer. Some growth companies aren't for holding long-term: Depending on macroeconomic conditions, growth stocks may not be long-term holds. For example, increasing interest rates works against growth companies. Dividends not typical: Growth companies rely on capital for expansion, so don't expect dividends in the short term. High P/E rates: Growth companies often trade at high multiples of earnings; entry into growth stocks may be higher than entry into other types of stocks. Growth investing is inherently riskier and generally only thrives during certain economic conditions. Investors looking for shorter investing horizons with greater potential than value companies are best suited for growth investing. Growth investing is also ideal for investors not concerned with investment cash flow or dividends. According to a study from New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, \u201cWhile growth investing underperforms value investing, especially over long periods, it is also true that there are sub-periods, where growth investing dominates.\u201d The challenge, of course, is determining if these \u201csub-periods\u201d are occurring.\u00a0While trying to time the market is often unwise, growth investing is most suitable for investors who believe strong market conditions lie ahead. Because growth companies are generally smaller and younger with less market presence, they are more likely to go bankrupt than value companies. It could be that growth investing is better for investors with higher disposable income as there is more downside for the loss of capital than other investing strategies. One reason index investing with the S&P 500 is so popular is that the companies held by the funds are a mix of value and growth stocks. Momentum investors ride the wave. They believe winners keep winning and losers keep losing. They look to buy stocks experiencing an uptrend. Because they believe losers continue to drop, they may short-sell those securities. Momentum investors are heavily reliant on technical analysis. They use a strictly data-driven approach to trading and look for patterns in stock prices to guide their purchasing decisions. This adds weight to how a security has been trading in the short term. Momentum investors are thus in open defiance of the efficient-market hypothesis, which states that asset prices fully reflect all information available to the public. A momentum investor believes that given all the publicly disclosed information; there are still material short-term price moves that can be taken advantage of. Despite some shortcomings, momentum investing has its appeal. High risk/high reward: Higher risk means higher reward, and there's greater potential short-term gains using momentum trading. Short-term trading: Momentum trading is done in the short term, and there's no need to tie up capital for long periods of time. More immediate data to review: This style of trading can be seen as simpler as it doesn't rely on bigger picture elements. Exciting: Momentum trading is often the most exciting style of trading. With quick price action changes, it is a much more engaging style than strategies that require holding securities long term. Experience is a must: Momentum trading requires a high degree of skill to properly gauge entry and exit points. Volatility: Momentum trading relies on market volatility; without prices quickly rising or dropping, there may not be suitable trades to be had. Taxes: Depending on your investment vehicles, there's increased risk for short-term capital gains. Wipeouts: Losses can happen very quickly; without notice, an entry and exit point may no longer exist and you're stuck with the losses coming your way. Below, you can see the price trajectory of iShares Edge MSCI World Momentum Factor ETF (IWMO), which tracks the MSCI World Momentum Index and a typical benchmark, the S&P 500 index. Traders who adhere to a momentum strategy must always be at the switch and ready to buy and sell. Profits build over months, not years. This contrasts simple buy-and-hold strategies that take a \"set it and forget it\" approach. In addition to being heavily active with trading, momentum investing often calls for a skilled ability to use technical analysis. Momentum investing relies on data for proper entry and exit points, and these points are continually changing based on market sentiment. For those with little interest in watching the market closely there are momentum-style ETFs. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is when you make regular investments over time, as when you set aside part of your paycheck for your 401(k). It can be and often is used with the other strategies above. However, the point of this is discipline: even if the market is going down or you're most worried about investing, you still put away a set amount periodically. This means you benefit when stocks are low and you can buy more with the same amount of funds. \"When\u00a0dollar-cost\u00a0averaging into ETFs, investors should consider the index that the ETF tracks and whether it\u2019s a good fit for their portfolio, as well as all relevant fees,\" David Tenerelli, a certified financial planner at Strategic Financial Planning in Plano, Texas, told us. \"This includes not just the expense ratio of the ETF but also the average trading bid/ask spread and whether they might be paying a premium for the shares relative to the net asset value of the ETF (net asset value, or NAV, is simply the aggregate value of the underlying investments held within the ETF).\" This disciplined approach becomes particularly powerful when you use automated features that invest for you. The benefit of the DCA strategy is that it avoids the market timing strategy, which can be painful and ill-fated for many people. Even seasoned investors occasionally feel the temptation to buy when they think prices are low, only to discover that their market timing was wrong. To show the benefits of DCA, we simulated investing in an S&P 500 index-based ETF from 2004 to 2024, putting in $50 each month and accounting for fees, taxes, and dividends: As you can see, if you invest in regular increments, you can capture prices at all levels, from high to low. These periodic investments effectively lower the average per-share cost of the purchases and cut the potential taxable basis when you sell laton. DCA can be combined with the other strategies mentioned above. During periods of declining prices, your average cost basis will decrease, increasing potential future gains. DCA removes the emotional element of investing, requiring reoccurring investments regardless of how the markets are doing. Once set up, DCA can be incredibly passive and require minimal maintenance. DCA can be difficult to automate especially if you are not familiar with your broker's platform. During periods of declining prices, your average cost basis will decrease, increasing your future tax liability. You must have steady, stable cash flow to invest to DCA. Investors may be tempted not to monitor DCA accounts; however, investments\u2014even automated ones\u2014should be reviewed periodically. DCA is a wise choice for most investors. It keeps you committed to saving while reducing the level of risk and the effects of volatility. Most investors are not in a position to make a single, large investment. A DCA approach is an effective countermeasure to the cognitive bias inherent to humans. New and experienced investors alike are susceptible to hard-wired flaws in judgment. A misconception of dollar-cost averaging\u2014putting away a set amount periodically no matter what\u2014is that your portfolio suffers when the markets dip, Tenerelli, the Texas-based advisor, told us. In fact, it's when you're buying the same assets at a discount since most indexes return to normal given time. Loss aversion bias, for example, causes us to view the gain or loss of an amount of money asymmetrically. In addition, confirmation bias leads us to focus on and remember information that confirms our long-held beliefs while ignoring contradictory information that may be important. DCA circumvents these common problems by removing human frailties from the equation. You must have ongoing cash flow and reoccurring disposable income for a workable DCA strategy. Many online brokers have options to set up reoccurring deposits. You can adjust them based on changes in your personal cash flow or investment preference. Below is a short quiz to help you determine the investing strategy that best fits your finances, goals, and risk tolerance: Suppose you've narrowed down a strategy; great! There are still a few things you'll need to do before you make the first deposit into your investment account. First, figure out how much money you need to start investing. This includes your upfront investment and how much you can continue investing. You'll also need to decide on the best way for you to invest. Do you intend to go to a traditional financial advisor or broker, or is a passive, worry-free approach better for you? If you choose the latter, consider signing up with a robo-advisor. Consider your investment vehicles. Cash accounts can be immediately withdrawn but often have the greatest consequences. Accounts like 401ks can't be touched until you retire without fees and have more limited options, but your company may match your investment. Different types of IRAs also have various levels of flexibility. It also pays to diversify. To reduce the risk of one type of asset bringing down your entire portfolio, consider spreading your investments across stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and alternative assets. If you're socially conscious, you may consider responsible investing. Now is the time to figure out what you want your investment portfolio to be made of and what it will look like. A general investment strategy is formed based on your long-term goals. How much are you trying to save? What is your timeline for saving? What are you trying to achieve? Once you have your financial goals in place, you can set target performance on returns and savings, then find assets that mesh with that plan. For example, your goal may be to save $1 million. To reach this, you need to invest $10,000 per year for 29 years and achieve 8% annual returns. Armed with this information, you can analyze various historical investment performances to try and find an asset class that achieves your strategic target. Warren Buffett has long been widely regarded as among the world's most skilled and successful investors. Warren Buffett's investing strategy is based on the principles of value investing. He focuses on identifying undervalued companies with strong fundamentals, consistent earnings, and competitive advantages (which he calls \"economic moats\"). Buffett believes in long-term investing, holding stocks for many years or even decades. He also emphasizes the importance of understanding the businesses he invests in and only investing within his \"circle of competence.\" Lastly, Buffett prefers companies with strong management teams, low debt, and the ability to generate high returns on invested capital. Risk tolerance is the amount of risk that an investor is willing to endure. It plays a significant role in determining the type of investment strategy that someone chooses and how much they opt to invest. Investors with longer time horizons might be more willing to take on a riskier investment, while investors focused on a short-term financial goal might be more risk-averse. There's always a risk-return trade-off. In other words, the safer your investments are, the lower the expected returns over time (and vice versa). That said, there are ways to maximize investment returns while minimizing risk. One effective approach is to create a well-diversified portfolio across various asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. By spreading your investments across different sectors and industries, you can cut the impact of any single investment's performance on your overall portfolio. This helps to mitigate unsystematic risk, which is the risk associated with individual companies or sectors. A good way to follow this strategy is to use low-cost index funds or ETFs and follow the model of modern portfolio theory. This provides for a passive long-term portfolio that maximizes return for a given level of risk. Cash is, by definition, the lowest-risk asset since it can't incur a loss ($1 always = $1), but it will lose purchasing power because of inflation over time. U.S. Treasurys\u00a0are also considered one of the safest investments, as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Treasurys have various maturities, ranging from short-term Treasury bills (T-bills) to longer-term Treasury notes and bonds. While Treasurys are generally considered risk-free in terms of default risk, they are still subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, the value of existing bonds declines, as newer bonds are issued with higher yields. How you choose your strategy may be more important than the strategy itself. Indeed, any of these strategies can generate a significant return if the investor makes a choice and commits to it. It is essential to choose because the sooner you start, the greater the effects of compounding. Remember, don\u2019t focus exclusively on annual returns when choosing a strategy. Take the approach that suits your goals, income, and risk tolerance. With a plan in place and your goals set, you'll be on a prudent long-term investment journey.

            "title": "10 Timeless Rules for Investors",
            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications. Bob Farrell\u00a0spent decades as the head of research at Merrill Lynch, establishing himself as one of the leading market analysts on Wall Street. His insights on technical analysis and general market tendencies were canonized as \"10 Market Rules to Remember\" and have been distributed widely ever since. Here, we review these timeless axioms and how they can help you achieve better returns. Whether they face extreme optimism or pessimism, markets eventually revert to saner, long-term valuation levels. According to this theory, returns and prices will go back to whence they came\u2014reversion generally puts the market back to a previous state. So when it comes to individual investors, the lesson is clear: Make a plan and stick to it.\u00a0Try to weigh out the importance of everything else that's going on around you and use your best judgment. Don't get thrown by the daily chatter and\u00a0turmoil of the marketplace. Like a swerving automobile driven by an inexperienced youth, we can expect overcorrection when markets overshoot. Remember, a correction is represented by a move of more than 10% of an asset's peak price, so an overcorrection can mean bigger movements. During a market crash, investors are presented with really great buying opportunities. But they tend overcorrect in either direction\u2014upward or downward\u2014and trading can happen at unbelievable levels. Tuned-in investors will be wary of this and will possess the patience and know-how to take measured action to safeguard their capital. The tendency among even the most successful investors is to believe that when things are moving in their favor, profits are limitless. That's just not true, and nothing lasts forever\u2014especially in the financial world. Whether you're riding market lows which represent buying opportunities, or soaring at highs so they can make money by selling, don't count your chickens before they've all hatched. After all, you may have to make a move at some point, because as the first two rules indicate, markets revert to the mean. Markets always revert to the mean. Sharply moving markets tend to correct sharply, which can prevent investors from contemplating their next move in tranquility.\u00a0The lesson here is to\u00a0be decisive in trading fast-moving markets and to place stops on your trades to avoid emotional responses. Stop orders help traders in two ways when asset prices move beyond a particular point.\u00a0By determining a specific entry or exit point, they can help investors limit the amount of money they lose, or help them lock in a profit when prices swing in either direction. The typical investor reads the latest news on their mobile phone, watches market programs, and believes what they're told. Unfortunately, by the time the financial press gets around to reporting a given price move,\u00a0that move is already complete and a reversion is usually in progress. This is\u00a0precisely the moment when John Q decides to buy at the top or sell at the bottom. The need to be a contrarian is underlined by this rule. Independent thinking always outperforms the herd mentality. Read about Investopedia's 10 Rules of Investing by picking up a copy of our special issue print edition. Basic human emotion is perhaps the greatest enemy of successful investing. But whether you're a long-term investor or a day trader, a disciplined approach to trading is key to profits. You must have a trading plan with every trade. You must know exactly at what level you are a seller of your stock\u2014on the upside and the down. Knowing when to get out of a trade is far more difficult than knowing when to get in. Knowing when to take a profit or cut a loss is very easy to figure in the abstract, but when you're holding a security that's on a quick move, fear and greed act quickly to separate you from reality\u00a0and your money. While there's much to be gained from a focus on popular index averages, the strength of a market move is determined by the underlying strength of the market as a whole. So broader averages offer a better take on the strength of the market. That's why it can pay off to follow different indexes\u2014at least those that are beyond the usual suspects like the S&P 500. Consider watching the Wilshire 5000\u00a0index or some of the Russell indexes to get a better appreciation of the health of any market move. The Wilshire 5000 index is composed of nearly 4,000 U.S-based companies that are traded on an American exchange and whose pricing is available to the public. Russell indexes like the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 are weighted by market cap and also give investors exposure to the U.S. stock market. Market technicians find common patterns in both bull and bear market action. The typical bear pattern, as described here, first involves a sharp sell-off. During a bear market, prices tend to drop 20% or more. In most cases, bear markets involve whole indexes. This kind of market is generally caused by weak or slowing economic activity. This is followed by what's called a sucker's rally. Investors can be drawn into the market by prices that jump quickly before making a sharp correction to the downside again. These rallies, which can be a result of speculation and hype, don't last very long. But who are the suckers? The investors, of course. They're called suckers because they may buy on the temporary highs, but end up losing money when asset prices drop. The final stage of the bear market is the torturous grind down to levels where valuations are more reasonable and\u00a0a general state of depression prevails regarding investments overall. This is not magic. When everyone who wants to buy has bought, there are no more buyers. At this point, the market must turn lower. Similarly, when everyone who wants to sell has sold, no more sellers remain. So when market experts and the forecasts are telling you to sell, sell, sell\u2014or buy, buy, buy\u2014be sure to know that everyone is jumping on that bandwagon, so much so that there's nothing left to sell or buy. By the point you jump in, something else is likely to happen. This is true for most investors since prices continue to rise during these periods. Who doesn't love seeing their profits rise? Well, unless you're a short seller. A short sale is when you sell an asset that you don't own yourself. Traders who use this strategy sell borrowed securities hoping the price will drop. The seller must then return an equal amount of shares in the future. No one said investing was easy. There's a lot at stake, and so much to take in. Whether you're a novice trader or someone who's been watching the markets for a great deal of time, it's easy to get caught up in the swings of market news, emotions, and the free-for-all of the market. But if you follow Bob Ferrell's time-tested secrets, you may just come out a winner in the end. Wilshire. \"Indexes.\" FTSE Russell. \"Russell U.S. Equity Indexes,\" Page 6."

            "content": "The Importance of Investing at Any Age Investing is an effective way to have your money work for you and build wealth. Holding cash and bank savings accounts are considered safe strategies, but investing your money allows it to grow in value over time with the benefit of compounding and long-term growth. Whether you invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, options,\u00a0futures, precious metals, real estate, or small businesses, investing is important to generate future income, increase value and equity, and build wealth. An individual's goals depend on a host of factors that may include age, income, and risk profiles.\u00a0Age can be further subdivided into the following three categories: These segments\u00a0often miss their marks at the appropriate age, with middle-aged folks\u00a0considering\u00a0investments for the first time or the elderly\u00a0forced to budget, employing\u00a0the discipline they lacked as young adults. Income provides the natural starting point for investment planning\u00a0because you can\u2019t invest what you don\u2019t have. A young adult's first job issues a wake-up call, forcing decisions about IRA\u00a0contributions, savings, or money market accounts, and the sacrifices\u00a0needed to balance growing affluence with the desire for\u00a0gratification. Don't worry too much about\u00a0setbacks during this period, like getting overwhelmed by\u00a0student loans\u00a0and\u00a0car payments, or forgetting that your parents\u00a0no longer pay\u00a0the monthly credit card bill. Outlook defines\u00a0the playing field on which we operate during our lifetimes and the choices that impact wealth management.\u00a0Family planning sits\u00a0at the top of this\u00a0list for many\u00a0individuals, with couples figuring out how many kids they want, where they want to live, and how much money is needed\u00a0to accomplish\u00a0those goals. Career expectations often complicate\u00a0these calculations, with the highly-educated enjoying\u00a0increased earning\u00a0power while those stuck in low-level jobs are\u00a0forced to cut back to make ends meet. It\u2019s never too late to become an investor. You may be well into middle age\u00a0before realizing that life is moving quickly, requiring a plan to deal with\u00a0old age and retirement. Fear can take control if waiting too\u00a0long to set investment goals, but that\u00a0should go away once you set the plan into motion. Remember that all investments start with the first dollar, whatever your age, income, or outlook.\u00a0That said,\u00a0those investing for decades have the advantage, with growing wealth allowing them to enjoy the lifestyle that others cannot afford. Whether your goal is to send your kids to college, build wealth to hand down, or to retire on a yacht in the Mediterranean, investing is essential in\u00a0reaching your financial objectives in life.

            "title": "Investing vs. Speculating: What's the Difference?",
            "content": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University. Investors and traders take on calculated risk as they attempt to profit from transactions they make in the markets. The level of risk undertaken in the transactions is the main difference between investing and speculating. Whenever a person spends money with the expectation that the endeavor will return a profit, they are investing. In this scenario, the undertaking bases the decision on a reasonable judgment made after a thorough investigation of the soundness that the endeavor has a good probability of success. But what if the same person spends money on an undertaking that shows a high probability of failure? In this case, they are speculating. The success or failure depends primarily on chance, or on uncontrollable (external) forces or events. The primary difference between investing and speculating is the amount of risk undertaken. High-risk speculation is typically akin to gambling, whereas lower-risk investing uses a basis of fundamentals and analysis. Investing can come in many different forms\u2014through monetary, time, or energy-based methods. In the financial sense of the term, investing means the buying and selling of securities such as stocks, bonds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, and a variety of other financial products. Investors hope to generate income or profit through a satisfactory return on their capital by taking on an average or below-average amount of risk. Income can be in the form of the underlying asset appreciating in value, in periodic dividends or interest payments, or in the full return of their spent capital. Most often, investing is the act of buying and holding an asset for the long-term. To classify as a long-term holding, the investor must own the asset for at least one year. Let's consider a large stable multinational company as an example of investing. This company may pay a consistent dividend that increases annually, and it may have a low business risk. An investor may choose to invest in this company over the long-term to make a satisfactory return on their capital while taking on relatively low risk. Additionally, the investor may add several similar companies across different industries to their portfolio to diversify and further lower their risk. Analysis and research is a key part of the investment process. It involves evaluating different assets, sectors, and patterns or trends that occur in the market. Investors can use tools like fundamental or technical analysis to choose their investment strategies or design their portfolios. By using fundamental analysis, investors can determine what factors affect the value of securities, from microeconomic to macroeconomic factors. Technical analysis, on the other hand, uses statistical trends such as security prices and volumes to find opportunities in the market. Investors have many options available for them to invest their money. Brokerage accounts give investors access to a variety of securities. By opening an account, an investor agrees to make deposits and then places orders through the firm. The assets and income belong to the investors, while the brokerage takes a commission for facilitating the trades. With new technology, investors can now invest with robo-advisers, too. These are automated investment companies that use an algorithm to come up with an investment strategy based on investors' goals and risk tolerance. Speculating is the act of putting money into financial endeavors with a high probability of failure. Speculating seeks abnormally high returns from bets that can go one way or the other. While speculating is likened to gambling, it is not exactly the same, as speculators try to make an educated decision on the direction of their trades. However, the inherent speculative risk involved in the transaction tends to be significantly above average. These traders buy securities with the understanding that they will be held for only a short period before selling. They may frequently move into and out of a position. As an example of a speculative trade, consider a volatile junior gold mining company with an equal chance over the near-term of skyrocketing from a new gold mine discovery or going bankrupt. With no news from the company, investors would tend to shy away from such a risky trade. However, some speculators may believe the junior gold mining company will strike gold and may buy its stock on a hunch. This hunch and the subsequent activity by investors is called speculation. Speculative trading does have its downfalls. When there are inflated expectations of growth or price action for a particular asset class or sector, values will rise. When this happens, trading volume increases, eventually leading to a bubble. This happened with the dotcom bubble. Investment in Internet companies grew exponentially in the late 1990s, with valuations rising rapidly. The market crashed after 2001, causing major tech companies to lose a big chunk of their value, with many others being wiped out.\ufeff\ufeff Day trading is a form of speculation. Day traders don't necessarily have any specific qualifications, rather, they are labeled as such because they trade often. They generally hold their positions for a day, closing once the trading session is complete. A swing trader, on the other hand, holds their position up to about several weeks hoping to capitalize on gains during that time. This is accomplished by trying to determine where a stock's price will move, taking a position, and then making a profit. Speculators can make many types of trades and some of these include: Popular strategies speculators use range from stop-loss orders to pattern trading. With a stop-loss order, a trader tells a broker to buy or sell a stock when it reaches a specific price. By doing this, the investor is able to minimize their loss on the stock. Meanwhile, pattern trading uses trends in prices to identify opportunities. Used in technical analysis, investors employ this strategy by looking at past market performance to make predictions about the future of an asset; a feat which is generally very challenging. Both investors and speculators put their money into a variety of different investment vehicles including stocks and fixed-income options. Stocks or equities represent a certain percentage of ownership in a company. These are purchased on exchanges or through a private sale. Companies are ranked by market capitalization or the total market value of their outstanding shares. Mutual funds and ETFs are also popular investment options. A mutual fund is managed by a fund manager who uses the pool of money from investors to purchase various assets and securities. ETFs hold a basket of underlying assets, and their prices change throughout the trading day just like those of stocks. Fixed-income assets include bonds, bills, and notes. These can be issued by corporations or various levels of government. Many fixed-income assets are used to fund projects and (business) ventures, and pay interest before they mature, at which time the vehicle's face value is paid back to the investor. For example, a bond issued by the U.S. Treasury mature at 20 or 30 years and pays investors interest bi-annually. Investors may want to consider the holding period for their investments and their tax implications. The holding period determines how much tax is owed on the investment. This period is calculated from the day after the investment is purchased until the day it is sold or disposed of. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers holdings of one-year or more to be long-term. Anything below this is considered a short-term investment. Long-term gains are generally taxed more favorably than short-term ones. Stephen Rischall CFP\u00ae, CRPCNavalign Wealth Partners, Encino, CA In general, the difference between investing and speculating is a long-term versus short-term time horizon. Investing is synonymous with having the intention to buy an asset that will be held for a longer period. Typically, there is a strategy to buy and hold the asset for a particular reason, such as seeking appreciation or income. Speculating tends to be synonymous with trading because it is more focused on shorter-term moves in the market. You would speculate because you think an event is going to impact a particular asset in the near term. Speculators often use financial derivatives, such as options contracts, futures contracts, and other synthetic investments rather than buying and holding specific securities.

            "content": "The internet has changed the way we live our lives. Not long ago purchasing stock was not as easy as it is now. The order went through a complex network of brokers and specialists before the execution was completed. In 1983, that all changed with a dentist in Michigan who made the first online stock transaction using a system developed by what is now E*TRADE Financial.\ufeff\ufeff Online brokers and easy access to financial data make investing your money as simple as starting a savings account.\u00a0But in an internet-driven, do-it-yourself\u00a0world,\u00a0is investing also a do-it-yourself activity? If so, why not just fire your financial advisor, pay fewer fees to your mutual funds, and set up a portfolio of your own? We look at some of the basics of managing your own money before you actually become your own financial manager. That first trade, made by William Porter, changed the way investment products are researched, discussed, bought, and sold. Computerized trading has resulted in highly liquid markets, making it easy to buy and sell most securities quickly. The do-it-yourselfer now has access to the same free financial data\u00a0professionals use. Websites like StockTwits set up entire communities of investors and traders who exchange information in real time. But just because it's possible, does that mean managing your own money is a good idea? Professional investors have a saying: \"The stock market is an expensive place to learn how to invest.\" They understand that it's easier to lose money than it is to make money, and because of that, some argue that the wealth of information available to people with an inexperienced\u00a0financial background may offer a false sense of security. Tools are only as good as the knowledge and experience of the person using them. Does a high-priced software package used by the world's best composers result in beautiful music? Does the newest innovation in surgical technology make a person with no prior training in the field a top-performing surgeon? There's no doubt that the internet has given the retail investor the tools that they need to effectively manage their own money, but what about the knowledge and experience to use the tools effectively? For an investor who wants to manage their own money, what types of fundamental knowledge should they have before firing their financial adviser? It's important to get a grasp of the modern portfolio theory (MPT) and gain an understanding of how asset allocation is determined for an individual based on their individual factors. In order to gain a true understanding of these principles, you'll have to dig deeper than the top-level internet articles that tell you that MPT is simply understanding allocation. MPT is not just about the allocation, but also its efficiency. The best money managers understand how to position your money for maximum return with the least amount of risk. They also understand that efficiency is highly dynamic as the person ages and their financial picture changes. Along with efficiency comes the dynamic nature of risk tolerance. At certain points in our lives, our risk tolerance may change. Along with retirement, we might have intermediate financial goals like saving for college or starting a new business, the portfolio has to be adjusted to meet those goals. Financial advisors often use proprietary software that produces detailed reports not available to the retail investor. In the plethora of free resources available, risk is treated too benignly. The term risk tolerance has been so overused that retail investors may believe that they understand risk if they understand that investing may involve losing money from time to time. But it's not really that simple. In fact, it's much more than that. Risk is a behavior that is hard to understand rationally because investors often act against\u00a0their best interests. A study conducted by Dalbar showed that inexperienced investors tend to buy high and sell low, which often leads to losses in short-term trades.\ufeff\ufeff Risk is hard to understand rationally because investors often act against\u00a0their best interests. Since risk is a behavior, it's extremely difficult for an individual to have an accurate, unbiased picture of their true attitude towards risk. Day traders, often seen as having a high-risk tolerance, may actually have an extremely low tolerance because they're unwilling to hold an investment for longer periods. Great investors understand that success comes with fending off emotion and making decisions based on facts. That's hard to do when you're working with your own money. Do you know how likely you are to outperform the overall market? What is the likelihood of any one football player being better than most of the other NFL players, and if they are better for a season what is the likelihood that they will be the best of the best for decades? Efficient market hypothesis (EMH) might contain the answer. EMH states that everything known about an investment product is immediately factored into the price. If Intel releases information that sales will be light this quarter, the market will instantly react and adjust the value of the stock. According to EMH, there is no way to beat the market for sustained periods because all prices reflect true or fair value. For the retail investor who tries to pick individual stock names in the hopes of achieving gains that are larger than the market as a whole, this may work in the short term, just as gambling can sometimes produce short-term profits. But over a sustained period of decades, this strategy breaks down, at least, according to the proponents of EMH. Even the brightest investment minds employing teams of researchers all over the world haven't been able to beat the market over a sustained period, according to famed investor Charles Ellis in his book, \"Winning The Loser's Game: Timeless Strategies For Successful Investing.\"\ufeff\ufeff Critics of this theory cite investors like Warren Buffett who consistently beat the market, but what does EMH mean for the individual investor? Before deciding on your investing strategy, you need the knowledge and statistics to back it up. If you're going to pick individual stocks in the hopes that they'll appreciate in value faster than the overall market, what evidence leads you to the idea that this strategy will work? If you're planning to invest in stocks for dividends, is there any evidence that proves that an income strategy works? Would investing in an index fund be the best way? Where can you find the data needed to make these decisions? What do you do for a living? If you have a college degree, you might be one of the people who say that you didn't become highly skilled as a result of your degree, but instead because of the experience you amassed. When you first started your job were you highly effective from the very beginning? Before managing your own money, you need experience. Gaining experience for investors often means losing money, and losing money in your retirement savings isn't an option. Experience comes from watching the market and learning first-hand how it reacts to daily events. Professional investors know that the market has a personality that is constantly changing. Sometimes it's hypersensitive to news events and other times it brushes them off. Some stocks are highly volatile while others have muted reactions. The best way for the retail investor to gain experience is by setting up a virtual or paper trading account. These accounts are perfect for learning to invest while also gaining experience before committing real money to the markets. Many people have found success in managing their own money, but before putting your money at risk, become a student in the art of investing. If somebody wanted to do your job based on what they read on the internet, would you advise it? If you were looking for a financial advisor, would you hire yourself based on your current level of knowledge? You may answer in the affirmative,\u00a0but until you have the knowledge and experience as a money manager, managing a brokerage account with money that you could stand to lose might be okay, but leave your retirement money to the professionals.

            "content": "Adam Hayes, Ph.D., CFA, is a financial writer with 15+ years Wall Street experience as a derivatives trader. Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master's in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology. He is a CFA charterholder as well as holding FINRA Series 7, 55 & 63 licenses. He currently researches and teaches economic sociology and the social studies of finance at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The options for investing your savings are always increasing but they can all still be categorized according to three fundamental characteristics: safety, income, and growth. The first task of any successful individual investor is to find the correct balance among these three worthy goals. The success of one can come at the expense of the others. It's said that there's no such thing as an absolutely safe and secure investment but you can get pretty close. Investing in government-issued securities in stable economic systems is one. U.S.-issued bonds remain the gold standard. You have to envision the collapse of the U.S. government to worry about losing your investment in them. AAA-rated corporate bonds are also considered safe. They're issued by large, stable companies. These securities are arguably the best means of preserving your principal while receiving a pre-set rate of interest. The risks are similar to those of government bonds. IBM or Costco would have to go bankrupt to warrant worrying about losing money investing in their bonds. Extremely safe investments are also found in the money market. Because of increasing risk, these\u00a0securities include\u00a0Treasury bills (T-bills), certificates of deposit (CDs), commercial paper, or bankers' acceptance slips. But safety comes at a price. The returns are very modest compared to the potential returns of riskier investments. This is referred to as \"opportunity risk.\" Those who choose the safest investments may be giving up big gains. There's also interest rate risk to some extent. You could tie your money up in a bond that pays a 1% return then watch as inflation rises to 2%. You've just lost money in terms of real spending power. The very safest investments are short-term instruments, such as three-month and six-month CDs, for this reason. The safest investments pay the least of all in interest. Investors who focus on income may buy some of the same fixed-income assets that are described above but their priorities shift toward income. They're looking for assets that guarantee a steady income supplement and they may accept a bit more risk to get there. Income is often the priority of retirees who want to generate a stable source of monthly income while keeping up with inflation. Government and corporate bonds may be in the mix, and an income investor may go beyond the safest AAA-rated choices and go longer than short-term CDs. The ratings are assigned by a rating agency that evaluates the financial stability of the company or government issuing the bond. Bonds that are rated at A or AA are only slightly riskier than AAA bonds but they offer a higher rate of return. BBB-rated bonds carry a medium risk but more income. You're in junk bond territory beyond these ratings and the word \"safety\" doesn't apply. Income investors may also buy preferred stock shares or common stocks that historically pay good dividends. By definition, capital growth is achieved only by selling an asset. Stocks are capital assets. Barring dividend payments, their owners have to cash them in to realize gains. There are many other types of capital growth assets as well, from diamonds to real estate. They all share some degree of risk to the investor. Selling at less than the price you paid is referred to as a capital loss. The stock markets offer some of the most speculative investments available because their returns are unpredictable. Blue chip stocks\u00a0are generally considered to be the best of the bunch because many of them are reasonably safe. They offer modest income from dividends and the potential for capital growth over the long term. Growth stocks are for those who can tolerate some ups and downs. These are the fast-growing young companies that may grow up to be Amazons, or they might crash spectacularly. The dividend stars are established companies that may not grow in leaps and bounds but pay steady dividends year after year. Profits on stocks offer the advantage of a lower tax rate if they're held for a year or more. Many individual investors avoid stock-picking and go with one or more exchange-traded funds or mutual funds that can give them stakes in a broad selection of stocks. One built-in bonus of stocks is a favorable tax rate. Profits from stock sales are taxed at the capital gains rate if the stocks are owned for at least a year and this is less than the income tax rates paid by most investors. Read about Investopedia's 10 Rules of Investing by picking up a copy of our special issue print edition. Safety, income, and capital gains are the big three objectives of investing but there are others that should be kept in mind as well. Some investors pursue tax minimization as a factor in their choices. A highly-paid executive may seek investments with favorable tax treatment to lessen the overall income tax burden. Contributing to an individual retirement account or any other tax-advantaged retirement plan is a highly effective tax minimization strategy. Investments such as bonds or bond funds are relatively liquid. They can be converted into cash quickly in many cases and with little risk of loss. Stocks are less liquid because they can be sold easily but selling them at the wrong time can cause a serious loss. Many other investments are illiquid. Real estate or art can be excellent investments unless you're forced to sell them at the wrong time. The maturity terms of Treasury bills (T-bills) range from four weeks to a maximum of one year. This makes them essentially short-term investments if your goal is to make some money by a time on the near horizon. Junk bonds come with low scores from the primary raters: S&P, Moody's, and Fitch. These scores are typically less than BBB. Junk bonds are inherently risky for investors. They can be tempting because they often pay high interest but they run the risk of default so you could end up losing money despite the interest rate. Capital gains tax rates are favorable if you hold an asset for at least one day more than a year. These are classified as long-term gains and most are taxed at rates of 0%, 15%, or 20%. These rates can be significantly less than your income tax bracket for the year but qualifying for each rate depends on your overall taxable income. Nonetheless, the IRS indicates that most taxpayers fall into the 15% category. You can be liable for a capital gains tax when you sell an asset for more than you invested in it. You'll want to hold onto a profitable asset for at least one year and one day for more favorable long-term tax treatment. Otherwise, capital gains are taxed along with your other income according to your marginal tax bracket. The answer doesn't lie in a single choice among safety, growth, or capital gains for most investors. The best choice is a mix of all three that meets your needs. And it will most likely change over time. Your appetite for capital gains may be highest when you're at the start of your career, and you can withstand a lot of risks, but you might prioritize holding onto that nest egg and dialing down the risk as you approach retirement. Your portfolio will probably reflect one pre-eminent objective at any stage in life, with all other potential objectives carrying less weight in the overall scheme.

When evaluating stock screeners, several key factors to consider can significantly impact your trading experience and success. Ease of use and cost top the list, especially for beginners. A platform that is easy to navigate and understand, akin to using a familiar app, can streamline the process of finding stocks that match your criteria. Additionally, educational resources play a pivotal role in empowering traders to make informed decisions. Look for screeners that offer tutorials, guides, and educational content to enhance your understanding of the market and improve your trading strategies. Trade Ideas With its lightning-fast platform and AI-driven functionalities for screening hundreds of criteria, Trading Ideas makes our list as the best stock screener for day trading. Stock screener with AI functionalities Integration with brokerages Customizable screens Live trading room Only works with U.S. and Canadian stock exchanges Day traders need access to real-time data, and they need it now.

Trade Ideas was founded in 2003 by a group of financial technology entrepreneurs in response to the growing demand for DIY investing. Located in Encinitas, California, the customized server-based technology connects directly to the exchanges, enabling it to track every stock and ETF traded. Every tick is analyzed and tested, measuring financial securities' behavior against the past in real time. That's the kind of edge that day traders need.

With more experience, traders can choose to customize their screens with their own criteria. Traders also have access to a live trading room, real-time streaming trade ideas, and simultaneous charts. Trade Ideas connects directly to online brokerage firms such as E-Trade to allow traders to move between simulated trading and real-world trading.

A standard plan is available for $127 a month without full access to AI technology, and a further discount is available if you pay annually. A third baseline option called TI Strength Alerts for $17 a month gives you five new trade ideas every Sunday. If you still aren't convinced about the service, Trade Ideas now offers a free version that can be used to test the pre-built layouts, scans, and screeners. However, as you develop as a day trader, you might also outgrow the free version. If that time comes, you will have the ability to upgrade anytime. FINVIZ FINVIZ offers the right combination of swing trading tools, including a large selection of fundamental and technical criteria, real-time quotes, charts, backtesting, pre-market data, and email alerts. All this makes it our pick as the best stock screener for swing trading. Highly visual approach to screening Ease of use Good selection of fundamental and technical screening criteria Access to global stocks Free version is sufficient for many swing traders Fewer fundamental metrics than other screeners on this list Located in New York City, FINVIZ's stock screener has been a popular choice for investors since its inception in 2007. But what makes it stand out for swing traders is its comprehensive toolset, which includes real-time data, interactive charts, pre-market data, and backtesting using years of historical data. FINVIZ is a great choice for all types of investors and traders, but it's our pick as the best stock screener for swing trading. FINVIZ is short for Financial Visualizations, a reference to the unique and compelling way it presents information, making it easy and fun to navigate. Users can access a stock chart simply by hovering over the stock symbol in the screener. But its real claim to fame is the way it has stacked its screener with many useful tools and features. Its Elite screener is a powerful research tool with access to real-time data, advanced charts, pre-market data, customized filters, and data export capabilities. Its charts are interactive, allowing users to use a crosshair cursor to pinpoint exact data points or check a stock's relative strength indicator. You can also compare a stock's performance with the S&P 500 index. Everything is saved in your portfolio. You can use the screener for up to 100 portfolios and up to 200 screener presets. FINVIZ*Elite is an excellent value at $39.50 per month or $299.50 a year. It also offers a free plan, but the data is not available in real-time. That might be okay if you're more of a buy-and-hold investor or you set up your swing trades pre- or post-market. ZACKS Zacks Investment Research has a comprehensive stock screener solution with high functionality supported by a massive number of metrics. The free version offers enough tools to conduct thorough and informed filtering of stocks, which is why we picked Zacks as the best free option for a stock screener.

Integration is flawless if you open a TC2000 brokerage account for trading, allowing you to effortlessly move from screening on a wide range of fundamental and technical screens to managing your watchlists to executing trades. The same power and maneuverability apply to its ETF and options screening. The only downside of TC2000 is that it's limited to U.S. and Canadian exchanges. That aside, the powerful TC2000 stock screener, coupled with its solid customer support, makes it hard to beat. TradingView TradingView stacks up well with any of the stock screeners on this list, but where it excels is the breadth of securities it covers, including international stocks and funds from all over the globe. That makes TradingView our pick as the best stock screener for global investing. Excellent selection of fundamental screening criteria Extensive charting capabilities Expansive selection of global stocks Interactive trading room 30-day free trial Light on historical data For more experienced and active traders, speed and efficiency are paramount.

Day traders and stock investors need access to complex data analysis to be able to sift through the tens of thousands of stocks in the U.S. and global markets. They need access to high-quality stock screeners to do that. The best stock screeners combine ease of use with flexibility without sacrificing data accuracy or quantity. The best screeners have a broad range of stocks in their databases that can be filtered with precision using both preset and custom criteria. The interface should be intuitive, even for beginners. A stock screener is an essential tool used by stock traders and investors to sift through thousands of stocks so they can find those that best meet their criteria. Users can apply any number of filters based on fundamental and technical metrics to narrow down their lists. The more robust the screening filters, the more quickly the screener can find you a match. Users can also apply their own customized criteria to find a more precise match. The screener will instantly display the results in the categories you choose when criteria are applied. Stock screeners are used to identify stocks based on different investing scenarios, such as creating an asset allocation strategy, long-term buy-and-hold strategies, or day trading in and out of the market for quick returns. A good stock screener is well organized and easy to use, enabling you to find the filters you need and start the process with a few clicks. It's essential to use a stock screener with a wide range of filters and the ability to quickly sort through your results so you can drill down further. You should look for a stock screener most suited to your investing style. Some are ideally suited for day trading, while others are more appropriate for long-term investing. Keep in mind that some stock screeners only follow U.S. stock exchanges, while others have a global reach. Additional must haves include accurate data. Always check to ensure the data comes from a reputable and reliable source. Another feature to consider is ensuring the screener can save your screens. Otherwise, you'll have to continually re-enter your criteria, which can be time consuming. Utilizing premium stock screeners can give investors a sizable edge when trading in the market. Premium stock screeners are the way to go when it comes to getting the most out of a larger selection of tools and data. However, some of these high-profile screeners come with a learning curve as well as costs that are simply too high for inexperienced traders to justify. Below are some of the best free screeners novice traders can use while learning the ropes of trading. Zacks is the best free option for stock screeners. Beginning traders will find that they will be equipped with everything they need to research the stock market and execute timely trades. When traders are ready to upgrade to the premium version, they can easily do so without changing to another platform. Finviz is an excellent stock screening platform, but there is a learning curve that traders must overcome. The platform is a good stepping stone for traders to understand how complex screeners operate and the amount of information that traders will need to cipher before spending money on a premium stock screener. TradingView is another excellent option that traders can use before committing to a premium stock screener. The free version of TradingView offers an exceptional stock screener and a wide range of free indicators and market analyses that traders will appreciate. However, this stock screener might also have a learning curve for newer traders, but once traders get the hang of the platform, they can start considering upgrading, which is easy to manage. Investopedia collected vital data points for 30 companies offering stock screeners to identify the most essential factors. We used this data to review each screener for associated costs, functionality, available chart patterns, and other features to provide an unbiased, comprehensive review to ensure our readers decide on the right stock screener. Investopedia launched in 1999, and has been helping readers find the best best stock screeners since 2021. Stock screeners are relatively straightforward. After opening the screener, you choose the filters you want to use based on specific criteria, such as price, trading volume, price-to-earnings ratio, volatility, chart patterns, and other fundamental or technical metrics. You can layer on more filters until you get the results you want to further narrow down your choices. Google removed its stock screener in 2022 and replaced it with a more basic tool, eliminating many key features. Investors needing a stock screener with advanced features will want to find one that aligns with their trading style and fits their budget. Investors who actively trade on the market will find that there are several stock screeners to choose from. Although a good stock screener will be able to handle a wide range of demands, certain stock screeners are better equipped to handle different trading styles. For instance, there are stock screeners that focus on day trading, swing trading, and option trading. If traders do not adhere to a particular style, they can reap the benefits of a free stock screener either from an external screener or their preferred brokerage. Stock screeners can be a complex tool to learn and understand, especially for new traders. While having the best and most up-to-date screeners in trading is always nice, that level of sophistication will require a high degree of comprehension for these tools to work as intended. Keep in mind that aside from the intricate nature of screeners, they are costly. A beginner will want to find a screener that is not only cost-effective but one that can gradually introduce the trader to how a stock screener works. The stock screener that we feel fits this criteria is Zacks. It offers a free stock screener with the option to upgrade to better versions when you are ready. Yes, most stock screeners can screen for Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), but if you are an investor and are focused solely on ETF investing, then you may want to look for an ETF screener designed specifically for ETFs; Finviz not only has such capabilities but also allows ETF investors to use its screener free of charge. Our initial search revealed 30 stock screeners for our consideration. We narrowed the list to 16 by running them through our criteria of ease of use, selection of fundamental and technical filters, depth of filter criteria, customization, and extra functionality. After a more rigorous comparison, we identified the best stock screeners in six distinct categories.

Consistent in their release, wide in their scope and range, metrics such as the\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0(CPI) and written reports like the Beige Book are free for all investors to inspect and analyze. Policymakers, most notably those at the\u00a0Federal Reserve, use indicators to determine not only where the economy is going, but how fast it's getting there. Although investors should get to know economic indicators, the reports are admittedly often dry and the data is raw. In other words, information needs to be put into context before it can be helpful in making any decisions regarding investments and\u00a0asset allocation. But there is valuable information in those raw data releases. The various government and nonprofit groups that conduct the surveys and release the reports do a very good job of collating and cohesively presenting what would be logistically impossible for any one investor to do by themselves. Most indicators provide nationwide coverage and many have detailed industry breakdowns, both of which can be very useful to individual investors. In its simplest form, an indicator could be considered any piece of information that can help an investor decipher what is going on in the economy. The\u00a0U.S.\u00a0economy is essentially a living thing where, at any given moment, there are billions of moving parts\u2014some acting, others reacting. This simple truth makes predictions extremely difficult. They must always involve a large number of assumptions, no matter what resources are put to the task. But with the help of a wide range of economic indicators, investors are able to gain a better understanding of various economic conditions.\u00a0There are also indexes for\u00a0coincident indicators\u00a0and\u00a0lagging indicators\u2014the components of each are based on whether they tend to rise during or after an economic\u00a0expansion.\ufeff Once an investor understands how various indicators are calculated and their relative strengths and limitations, several reports can be used in conjunction to make for more thorough decision making. For example, in the area of employment, consider using data from several releases. By using the hours-worked data (from the\u00a0Employment Cost Index) along with the labor report and\u00a0nonfarm payrolls, investors can get a fairly complete picture of the state of the labor market. Additionally, are increasing retail sales figures being validated by increased personal expenditures? Are new factory orders leading to higher factory shipments and higher\u00a0durable goods\u00a0figures? Are higher wages showing up in higher personal income figures? The savvy investor will look up and down the\u00a0supply chain\u00a0to find validation of trends before acting on the results of any one indicator release. Some people may prefer to understand a couple of specific indicators really well and use this expert knowledge to make investment plays based on their\u00a0analyses. Others may wish to adopt a jack-of-all-trades approach, understanding the basics of all the indicators without relying on any one too much. For example, a retired couple living on a combination of\u00a0pensions\u00a0and long-term\u00a0Treasury bonds\u00a0should be looking for different things than a stock trader who rides the waves of the\u00a0business cycle. Most investors fall in the middle, hoping for stock market returns to be steady and near long-term historical averages (about 8% to 10% per year). Knowing what the expectations are for any individual release is helpful, as well as generally knowing the\u00a0macroeconomic\u00a0forecasts. Forecast numbers can be found at several public websites, such as\u00a0Yahoo! Finance\u00a0or\u00a0MarketWatch. On the day a specific indicator release is made, there will be press releases from newswires such as the Associated Press and Reuters, which will present figures with key pieces highlighted. It is helpful to read a report on one of the\u00a0newswires, which may parse the indicator data through the filters of analyst expectations, seasonality figures, and year-over-year results. For those that use investment advisors, these individuals will probably analyze recently released indicators in an upcoming newsletter or discuss them during upcoming meetings. Many investors, especially those who invest primarily in\u00a0fixed-income securities, are concerned about\u00a0inflation. Current inflation, how strong it is, and what it could be in the future are all vital in determining prevailing interest rates and investing strategies. There are several indicators that focus on inflationary pressure. The most notable in this group are the\u00a0Producer Price Index\u00a0(PPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Many investors will use the PPI to try and predict the upcoming\u00a0CPI. There is a proven statistical relationship between the two, as economic theory suggests that if producers of goods are forced to pay more in production, some portion of the price increase will be passed on to consumers. Each index is derived independently, but both are released by the\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Other key inflationary indicators include the levels and growth rates of the money supply and the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The\u00a0gross domestic product\u00a0(GDP) may be the most important indicator out there, especially to equity investors who are focused on corporate profit growth. Since the GDP\u00a0represents the sum of what our economy is producing, its growth rate is targeted to be in certain ranges. If the numbers start to fall outside those ranges, fear of inflation or\u00a0recession\u00a0will grow in the markets. To get ahead of this fear, many people will follow the monthly indicators that can shed some light on the quarterly\u00a0GDP\u00a0report. For example, capital goods shipments from the Factory Orders Report are used to calculate producers' durable equipment orders within the\u00a0GDP\u00a0report. Indicators such as retail sales and\u00a0current account\u00a0balances are also used in the computations of\u00a0GDP, so their release helps to complete part of the economic puzzle prior to the quarterly\u00a0GDP\u00a0release. Other indicators that aren't part of the actual calculations for\u00a0GDP\u00a0are still valuable for their predictive abilities. Metrics such as wholesale inventories,\u00a0the Beige Book, the\u00a0Purchasing Managers' Index\u00a0(PMI), and the labor report all shed light on how well our economy is functioning. With the assistance of all these monthly data,\u00a0GDP\u00a0estimates will begin to tighten up as the component data slowly gets released throughout the quarter. By the time the actual\u00a0GDP\u00a0report is released, there will be a general consensus of the figure that is remarkably accurate. If the actual results deviate much from the estimates, the markets will move, often with high\u00a0volatility. If the number falls right into the middle of the expected range, then the markets and investors can collectively pat themselves on the back and let prevailing investing trends continue. Sometimes indicators take on a more valuable role because they contain very timely data. The Institute for Supply Management's\u00a0PMI\u00a0report, for instance, is typically released on the first business day of every month.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff As such, it is one of the first pieces of aggregate data available for the month that just ended. While not as rich in detail as many of the indicators to follow, the category breakdowns are often picked apart for clues to things such as future labor report details (from the employment survey results) or wholesale inventories (inventory survey). The relative order in which the indicators are presented does not change month to month, so investors may want to mark a few days on their monthly calendars to read up on the areas of the economy that might change how they think about their investments or time horizon.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff Overall, asset allocation decisions can fluctuate over time, and making such changes after a monthly review of macro indicators may be wise. Benchmark pieces of economic indicator data arrive with no agenda or sales pitch. The data just\u00a0is,\u00a0and that is hard to find these days. By becoming knowledgeable about the\u00a0whats\u00a0and whys of the major economic indicators, investors can better understand the stock market and the economy in which their dollars are invested, and they can also be better prepared to revisit an investment thesis when the timing is right.\u00a0While there is no one \"magic indicator\" that can dictate whether to buy or sell, using economic indicator data in conjunction with standard asset and securities analysis can lead to smarter portfolio management for both the professional asset manager and the do-it-yourself investor.

            "title": "7 Ways to Invest $1,000",
            "content": "Investing is an incremental game, and building a solid portfolio takes time. Here are seven ways to invest $1,000 to help you get started. Paying off debt ensures a guaranteed return. The interest you save is essentially a risk-free investment. Once debt-free, you will be able to target your $1,000 toward an emergency fund into an account that earns interest, such as a savings account or money market account. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and index funds are a way to invest in the market with a small amount of money. These funds are transparent investments offered by financial institutions, and information is readily available for ETFs and index funds, including their holdings, commissions, and expense ratios. Pick the best broker for buying ETFs from our list of Best Brokers for ETFs. Index funds are a passive, broad market investment through the major indexes, while ETFs offer more choices to customize a portfolio. With $1,000, you can choose multiple ETFs with different risk profiles. For example, you might invest $250 in a higher-risk, growth-oriented ETF, $250 into a dividend ETF, and $500 into a bond ETF. Target-date funds offer similar diversity to ETFs, but they require less effort when choosing. A target-date fund may have a higher expense ratio than your basic ETF, but in return, the fund will allocate and rebalance the account for you over time based on the target date. Robo-advisors like Betterment, Acorns, and AssetBuilder use artificial intelligence (AI) and offer active management at lower expense ratios than the prices of human fund managers. This has prompted traditional advisors like Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab to use AI for some of their offerings. ETFs, index funds, and mutual funds are commonly stock funds with higher risk and return profiles than investments in debt instruments. U.S. Treasuries and savings bonds may carry competitive yields comparable to funds but at a lower risk. Investment bank Morgan Stanley expects inflation to be around 3.5% by the end of 2023, with Treasuries offering modest inflation-adjusted returns. Treasury bond income is also exempt from state and local taxes. Stock investment commonly requires a higher risk tolerance, but may garner higher potential returns for your $1,000. Over the last decade, an investment in Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), or Alphabet (GOOGL or GOOG) would have doubled or tripled $1,000. Stock investment requires research and timing. According to Morgan Stanley, stocks are priced to return 1.8% more than Treasuries in 2023, below the average spread of 3.5% over the last decade. Options trading and foreign exchange (forex) trading are very high-risk investments and are commonly used by experienced investors. Options are a form of derivative contract that gives buyers of the contracts the right to buy or sell a security at a chosen price at some point in the future. The forex market is a global marketplace for exchanging national currencies. Many traders lose more than $1,000 as they spend years learning this trading craft and making consistently profitable trades. An emergency fund is the money set aside as a financial safety net for unexpected expenses. Emergency funds should typically have three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses. Each investor has different financial goals and objectives. It\u2019s always advisable to pay down outstanding debt or build an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses. If you plan on putting the money to work in the markets, consider spreading it across several different asset classes, such as stocks, ETFs, and bonds to start building a balanced and diverse portfolio. History shows that time in the market rewards investors over the long term. Although there may be short-term fluctuations, stocks generally trend higher over time. Significant market downturns during the 2007\u201308 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic turned out to be buying opportunities for those prepared to wait patiently for returns. As investor Warren Buffett famously said, \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.\u201d With many available options, investors can use $1,000 to purchase ETFs, stocks, or bonds. Simply paying off outstanding debt may save money in interest payments over time and prove to be a wise investment.

            "title": "8 Common Investing Mistakes to Avoid",
            "content": "Investing is by no means always easy and profits are never guaranteed. There are countless books on investing and everyone has different tips and tricks that work for them. Even professional investors aren't always right even after years of practice. Additionally, every investor is different, with different investment goals, risk tolerances, and knowledge. However, there are some common mistakes that all investors should avoid, which we discuss below. One of the world's most successful investors, Warren Buffett, cautions against investing in companies whose business models you don't understand. The best way to avoid this is to build a diversified portfolio of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds. If you do invest in individual stocks, make sure you thoroughly understand each company those stocks represent before you invest. Too often, when we see a company we've invested in do well, it's easy to fall in love with it and forget that we bought the stock as an investment. Always remember,\u00a0you bought this stock to make money. If any of the fundamentals that prompted you to buy into the company change, consider selling the stock. A slow and steady approach to portfolio growth will yield greater returns in the long run. Expecting a portfolio to do something other than what it is designed to do is a recipe for disaster. This means you need to keep your expectations realistic with regard to the timeline for portfolio growth and returns. Read about Investopedia's 10 Rules of Investing by picking up a copy of our special issue print edition. Turnover, or jumping in and out of positions, is another return killer. Unless you're an institutional investor with the benefit of low commission rates, the transaction costs can eat you alive\u2014not to mention the short-term tax rates and the opportunity cost of missing out on the long-term gains of other sensible investments. Trying to time the market also kills returns. Successfully timing the market is extremely difficult. Even institutional investors often fail to do it successfully. A well-known study, \"Determinants of Portfolio Performance\" (Financial Analysts Journal, 1986), conducted by Gary P. Brinson, L. Randolph Hood, and Gilbert L. Beebower covered American pension fund returns. This study showed that, on average, nearly 94% of the variation of returns over time was explained by the investment policy decision. In layperson's terms, this means that most of a portfolio's return can be explained by the asset allocation decisions you make, not by timing or even security selection. Getting even is just another way to ensure you lose any profit you might have accumulated. It means that you are waiting to sell a loser until it gets back to its original cost basis. Behavioral finance calls this a \"cognitive error.\" By failing to realize a loss, investors are actually losing in two ways. First, they avoid selling a loser, which may continue to slide until it's worthless. Second, there's the opportunity cost of the better use of those investment dollars. While professional investors may be able to generate alpha (or\u00a0excess return over a benchmark) by investing in a few concentrated positions, common investors should not try this. It is wiser to stick to the principle of diversification. In building an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or mutual fund portfolio, it's important to allocate exposure to all major spaces. In building an individual stock portfolio, include all major sectors. As a general rule of thumb, do not allocate more than 5% to 10% to any one investment. Perhaps the number one killer of investment return is emotion. The axiom that fear and greed rule the market is true. Investors should not let fear or greed control their decisions. Instead, they should focus on the bigger picture. Stock market returns may deviate wildly over a shorter time frame, but, over the long term, historical returns tend to favor patient investors. An investor ruled by emotion may see this type of negative return and panic sell, when in fact they probably would have been better off holding the investment for the long term. In fact, patient investors may benefit from the irrational decisions of other investors. Below\u00a0are some other ways to avoid these common mistakes and keep a portfolio on track. Proactively determine where you are in the investment life cycle, what your goals are, and how much you need to invest to get there. If you don't feel qualified to do this, seek a reputable financial planner. Also, remember why you are investing your money, and you will be inspired to save more and may find it easier to determine the right allocation for your portfolio. Temper your expectations to historical market returns. Do not expect your portfolio to make you rich overnight. A consistent, long-term investment strategy over time is what will build wealth. As your income grows, you may want to add more. Monitor your investments. At the end of every year, review your investments and their performance. Determine whether your equity-to-fixed-income ratio should stay the same or change based on where you are in life. We all get tempted by the need to spend money at times. It's the nature of the human condition. So, instead of trying to fight it, go with it. Set aside \"fun investment money.\" You should limit this amount to no more than 5% of your investment portfolio, and it should be money that you can afford to lose. Do not use retirement money. Always seek investments from a reputable financial firm. Because this process is akin to gambling, follow the same rules you would in that endeavor. Common investing mistakes include not doing enough research, reacting emotionally, not diversifying your portfolio, not having investment goals, not understanding your risk tolerance, only looking at short-term returns, and not paying attention to fees. Good assets for new investors include certificates of deposit, money market funds, high-yield savings accounts, Treasury bonds, index funds, and 401(k) retirement accounts. These are all fairly low-risk investments that should generate some returns for the investor and will allow them to understand the fundamentals of investing. Yes, you can invest with $100. You can invest with any amount of money, it just depends on the specific asset. You can invest $100 in a certificate of deposit as well as in any stock that costs $100 or less. Mistakes are part of the investing process. Knowing what they are, when you're committing them, and how to avoid them will help you succeed as an investor. To avoid committing the mistakes above, develop a thoughtful, systematic plan, and stick with it. If you must do something risky, set aside some fun money that you are fully prepared to lose. Follow these guidelines, and you will be well on your way to building a portfolio that will provide many happy returns over the long term.

            "title": "The 7 Best Investing Books",
            "content": "\u2018Don\u2019t lose\u2019 is author Benjamin Graham\u2019s best advice for investors Michelle Lodge is a contributor to Investopedia, who is also a writer, editor, and podcaster. If you\u2019re like many astute people, you are always on the lookout for solid books on investing. You may want to start with a book that lays out the entire landscape of investing opportunities, from stocks and bonds to real estate, fine art, and cryptocurrencies. You may want to zero in on an area of investing or to understand the thinking behind how experts approach investing and money. Below, we have covered all areas, starting with our best overall book on investing: \"The Bond King,\" by NPR \u201cPlanet Money\u201d podcaster and journalist Mary Childs, who delivers a powerful biography of Bill Gross, formerly of PIMCO, who made a whole new market on trading bonds and ended up revered by some, but not by others, while becoming extremely wealthy. For value investing, we recommend Benjamin Graham\u2019s \"The Intelligent Investor,\" a favorite of many of the world\u2019s most successful investors. For a solid book on investing overall, we cite \"The Only Investment Guide You\u2019ll Ever Need\" by Andrew Tobias. This may be the year for books about Bill Gross. In addition to The Bond King by Mary Childs, which we rank the best overall investing book on our list, the subject himself has released a self-published autobiography titled I\u2019m Still Standing: Bond King Bill Gross and the PIMCO Express. Childs\u2019 authoritative, engaging book about pioneering bond trader Gross, from the investment management firm PIMCO, portrays him as brilliant and a visionary, who devised a new way to invest by making a market for trading bonds. Yet he also comes across as an egotistical, mercurial boss who was so verbally abusive to his staff that some avoided walking by his office to keep from running into him. After many years, enough staff members quit\u2014including PIMCO\u2019s former co-CEO and co-CIO, economist Mohamed El-Erian, whom Gross had recruited from Harvard Management Co. as his eventual successor\u2014that Gross was forced to resign from the company he built. Childs, a co-host of NPR\u2019s \u201cPlanet Money\u201d podcast who has also reported for Barron\u2019s, the Financial Times and Bloomberg News, takes the reader through the subprime mortgage crisis, in which many Americans lost their homes due to predatory lending practices. At the time, Gross\u2019 number was on the speed dial, so to speak, of many top federal and banking officials who valued his opinion and sway. Early on, Gross learned about strategy by successfully counting cards as a blackjack player at various Las Vegas casinos. He took that same push-to-the-limit mentality to the bond market, where he was dubbed the \u201cBond King\u201d by Fortune in 2002. During those years, he was a darling of the financial press\u2014beaming from business magazine covers, being interviewed on CNBC, and being a sought-after speaker at financial gatherings. After he was ousted from PIMCO, he went to Janus Capital Group, where he was unable to duplicate his earlier success. In 2019, Gross revealed that he had been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, which affects communication skills. In 2022, far from having \u201clost it all,\u201d Forbes put Gross\u2019 net worth at $2.6 billion. The key lesson from Benjamin Graham\u2019s much-lauded tome: \u201cDon\u2019t lose.\u201d Easier said than done, of course. So read on. The reason why this book, originally published in 1949, is still in print is that it offers investors\u2014be they beginners, those with some knowledge and success, or old hands\u2014the nuts and bolts of value investing, which is buying stocks of quality companies whose worth is undervalued. The practice is akin to buying a finely made piece of furniture at a discount. It was most recently updated in 2006. Graham largely shuns the practice of analyzing securities in favor of expanding on investment principles and investors\u2019 attitudes. He notes that the intelligence of any investor has nothing to do with IQ or SAT scores. \u201cIt simply means being patient, disciplined, and eager to learn; you must also be able to harness your emotions and think for yourself,\u201d he writes. Chapters cover investment vs. speculation, the investor and inflation, general portfolio strategy, stock selection for both the enterprising and defensive investors, comparisons of companies, and many other subjects. To bolster the book\u2019s relevance, Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Zweig added commentary after each chapter with recent examples. In the preface to the fourth edition, Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, wrote: \u201cI read the first edition of this book in early 1950, when I was 19. I thought then that it was by far the best book on investing. I still think it is.\u201d \u201cMany of society\u2019s most intractable problems\u2014from addressing the environment, to revitalizing decaying infrastructure in developed and developing nations alike to national security, to the hunger for innovation to stimulate economic growth\u2014resist easy solutions. Rather, they can only be addressed with the thoughtful application of time and money,\u201d write Victoria Ivashina and Josh Lerner, both Harvard Business School professors. The authors cite the Rockefeller family\u2019s wealth as an example of the use of patient capital. The patriarch, John D. Rockefeller, turned a $4,000 investment in the oil refinery Standard Oil into the initial source of the family\u2019s vast holdings. Two generations later\u2014led by his grandchildren, especially Laurance\u2014long-term capital brought about the development of Eastern Air Lines, a carve-out from General Motors; military contractor McDonnell Aircraft Corp., which eventually was folded into Boeing Co.; the unfolding of tourism and conservation in the U.S. Virgin Islands, including building the exclusive and environmentally friendly Caneel Bay resort on St. John Island; and providing critical funding for the expansion of national parks in the United States. \u201cRather than having a set life, RBI [Rockefeller Brothers, Inc., which included Laurance, four brothers, and sister, Babs] was organized as an evergreen fund. Laurance anticipated that the investments would be held for a decade and then sold or taken public,\u201d write Ivashina and Lerner. \u201cRather than being returned to investors (as in today\u2019s standard fund), the proceeds of the successful would flow back into the fund, ready to be used for subsequent investments.\u201d The authors explain that the use of patient capital, or long-term capital, means that the investor, like the Rockefeller family, is willing to wait as long as decades for a return. Governments aren\u2019t able to underwrite many of these projects, due to the lack of political will to fund such long-term plans. However, pools of capital in pensions, insurers, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, and family holdings matched with the right entities can do the job. These arranged marriages, the authors maintain, can yield \u201cbenefits for investors, fund managers, and society as a whole.\u201d This book about how investing went south reads like a thriller, and covers: Author Anita Raghavan characterizes Rajaratnam as the \u201cking of wealth\u201d and Gupta as the \u201cking of thought.\u201d Of the title, it was Gupta, a decade older than Rajaratnam, who was lured by the chance to become a billionaire after spending three decades at the consulting firm where he drew a salary in the millions. At the time of their arrests\u2014prosecuted by Indian-born Preet Bharara, then U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York\u2014some reporters lamented the men\u2019s downfall, saying it reflected poorly on the ascendant South Asian community. Raghavan\u2014herself of South Asian descent and a contributor to The New York Times, who also had held positions at The Wall Street Journal and Forbes\u2014noted that the Gupta-Rajaratnam affair is a part of the South Asian story but not its defining moment. In The Billionaire\u2019s Apprentice, she closes with a surprising Gupta family secret that foreshadows Rajat Gupta\u2019s crimes. After explaining\u00a0to readers that\u00a0The Ultimate Day Trader\u00a0 is for the experienced investor, Jacob Bernstein\u00a0welcomes beginners in the first chapter, \u201cDefinitions and Directions\u2014What It Means to Day\u00a0Trade Today,\u201d for those who are considering joining the market or simply want to know more about the subject. \u201cA day trader,\u201d he writes, \u201cis an individual who enters and exits a position in the markets during the course of the trading day.\u201d Of course, the \u201ctrading day\u201d is now 24 hours, due to the advent of 24-hour trading in many markets. Bernstein suggests there are 11 reasons to day trade, including reduced headline risk, knowing the results by the end of the \u201cday,\u201d the availability\u00a0of reliable forecasting, the chance for instant execution, market volatility, and the sheer pleasure of doing it. The downsides, which may not be drawbacks to all, are that day trading is very hard work, subject to random events that impact prices, time consuming, competitive, and\u00a0stressful. The author is the founder of the money management firm Bernstein Investments Inc. and has written 35 books on trading, investor, investor psychology, and economic forecasts, including\u00a0The Compleat Day Trader. Bernstein employs his straightforward, understandable writing style\u00a0and\u00a0punctuates it with charts and graphs to lead the reader through day trading markets and methods, gap day trading, volume spikes and their use in day trading, the importance of structure, exit strategies, and the \u201c10 Cardinal Rules of Day Trading.\u201d Among his rules are doing your homework, showing consistency, avoiding any stocks or futures markets that \u201cscare\u00a0you,\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0being willing and able to make big moves, which is the way to make\u00a0profits.\u00a0At the end, Bernstein asks whether you have what it takes to be a day trader. That is, can you own up to your losses and move on? If so, get started. This breezy book takes the reader on a journey across 19 short chapters, which spell out the sometimes odd ways that people think about money and the behavioral psychology surrounding it, then suggest ways to become more financially secure. One example: Author Morgan Housel recommends staying wealthy, as opposed to getting wealthy. To illustrate the point, he draws on the life and work of Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, who began investing as a child and simply loves to make money, while he famously shuns the modern trappings of wealth. Housel maintains that the goal of having money is the freedom it affords people to make choices that make them happy. \u201cIt is the highest dividend money pays,\u201d writes Housel, a former Wall Street Journal columnist, who has won many journalism awards. One place where we disagree with Housel: He considers Benjamin Graham\u2019s above-mentioned The Intelligent Investor dated and not useful for today\u2019s investors. However, the rest of his advice is excellent. \u201c[Housel\u2019s book] covers some of the most important topics in finance, which are unexpected and fun to contemplate. Why were Warren Buffett and Bill Gates so successful? Sure, they\u2019re smart people, but there are a lot of smart people out there. Buffett used time to his advantage and Gates was fortunate enough to attend a school where there was access to a computer [at a time when few schools had them],\u201d writes Certified Financial Planner Justin Pritchard. \u201cLives up to its brash title\u201d is how the Los Angeles Times described Andrew Tobias\u2019s investment book, which debuted in 1978 and has been revised several times, including in 2022. In the latest revision, this best-selling author covers the economic effects of the COVID-19 epidemic and how investors and taxpayers fared during the Trump administration and others prior. With knowledge and wit, Tobias takes readers through the basics of investment vehicles\u2014stocks, bonds (savings, municipal, corporate, convertible, zero-coupon), mutual funds, U.S. Treasury bills, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the various retirement accounts. He also delves into tax strategies and discusses finding and dealing with brokers. Tobias suggests a stock market strategy of putting the bulk of your savings in mutual funds and ETFs, and no more than 20% into funds you direct. Throughout, he assumes the role of the wise, well-off uncle, especially in the chapter \u201cA Penny Saved is Two Pennies Earned,\u201d in which he dispenses commonsense money advice on everything from credit cards to saving on vacations, monitoring your bank accounts, and buying cubic zirconium jewelry instead of diamonds (\u201cridiculous,\u201d he writes). In the appendices, Tobias tackles Social Security, life insurance, saving money by buying wine by the case, the national debt, and selected discount brokers. About the book, Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban wrote: \u201cThis is the only investment book I\u2019ve read that truly made sense.\u201d \"The Bond King,\" by NPR \u201cPlanet Money\u201d podcaster and journalist Mary Childs, is our best book overall. The tale of how Bill Gross, formerly of PIMCO, made a whole new market on trading bonds reveals how Wall Street works and how you can be fired from the company you built up and still end up with $2.6 billion.

            "content": "Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. There's not one best way to invest $100,000 in cash. You have many options depending on your goals and needs. You can choose the investment vehicle or a combination of vehicles that's right for you after determining that investing is something you should do with your money right now. Finding an extra $100,000 in discretionary cash on hand is a problem that most people would be happy to have. The key word here is discretionary. Your $100,000 in extra cash really is extra and you don't have any outstanding debt, especially high-interest credit card debt. Most finance professionals would otherwise say that your priority for that chunk of change should be to pay down your debts. You're already ahead of the game when that's been accomplished and if you already have some other assets in place such as a viable retirement plan, an adequate emergency fund, and some other well-placed capital. It may not be the most exciting prospect but consider paying off your mortgage if you have one. Consider investing in real estate if you don't already own your home or purchase an investment property. Real estate can be a solid investment but it has risks and requires that you do your due diligence. Most people think of purchasing and flipping properties or purchasing and renting out for income when they consider investing in real estate. Several factors contribute to whether gains would be realized quickly, over a long period, or even at all. First: location, location, location! A property's location is one of the most important determinants of its value. Choosing the right location is just as important as choosing the right property to get the biggest bang for your buck. The condition of the market is perhaps the best indicator of whether traditional real estate investing is a good idea. It might be a good time to sit back and wait for prices to settle if they're volatile. Real estate purchases command a significant outlay of capital. An investor should consider their return on investment (ROI), the property's profitability, and the associated costs before investing in it. Consider how much of your $100,000 will be used toward the purchase, repairs, renovations, and marketing of the property. Selling costs should be factored in for flips. Maintenance costs must be considered for rentals. Real estate is one of the few assets that tends to appreciate over time. Some investors hold their properties until such appreciation is large enough to generate the desired profit. A real estate investment trust (REIT) could be a great option if you want to invest in real estate without the complexities associated with directly purchasing property. Investing is simple and doesn't necessarily require a lot of money. Some investment platforms allow investments as low as $100. REITs have properties in their portfolios that generate income, unlike traditional real estate investments that are flipped and resold. They include retail spaces, medical facilities, residential properties, and commercial properties such as office buildings. You can purchase REIT shares through a broker or directly from a REIT company. REITs pay their shareholders dividends that are taxed as regular income but gains are taxed as capital gains. Your earnings or capital gains will be considered taxable income if you put your extra cash into taxable investments. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are among the most common. Some of these instruments such as dividend-paying stocks could generate periodic income. You can invest in high-yielding certificates of deposit (CDs) or a high-interest savings account if you're squeamish about investing in the\u00a0market\u00a0and want your money to be safe. Your principal is even insured by the federal government if the bank is an FDIC member and almost all banks are. CDs are paying better interest rates due to inflation. Rates above 4% can be found for short-term CDs as of late 2024. Compare offers for the best rates. Don't just drop by your local bank branch. Shop around for the best bank rates. Those for high-yield savings accounts may be offered by the online platforms of various financial services firms whose names you might already know such as Goldman Sachs, American Express, and Barclays Bank. You can also find out-of-state banks with competitive offers online. You could look into opening a Roth IRA account if your retirement plan is an individual retirement account (IRA) or a 401(k). Contributions to traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are tax-deductible but not tax-free. You pay the income tax due in the year you deposit the money to a Roth account but you'll owe no further tax on the principal or investment gains when you withdraw the money. Converting to a Roth IRA from a traditional account is a taxable event. The amount of the conversion is reported as ordinary taxable income. Not only can Roth earnings grow tax-free but these accounts aren't subject to the IRS minimum distribution rules. They allow funds to accumulate past retirement. There's no maximum age limit to participate unlike with traditional IRAs. Investing the entire $100,000 wouldn't be possible, however, unless you're rolling over from an eligible retirement account. The IRS limits how much you can contribute to a Roth annually. The maximum contribution is $7,000 or $8.000 for individuals age 50 or older in 2024. A taxpayer's adjusted gross income (AGI) can't exceed the limit for Roth eligibility. Married couples filing jointly can't contribute if their incomes are $240,000 or more in 2024. Your $100,000 is a respectable sum that allows you to apply the investing 101 mantra of diversification. Consider dividing up the $100,000. Put a portion of it into vehicles that you already own like your IRA and try some new investment tools with the balance. Deciding how to allocate this kind of extra capital involves weighing your options carefully, considering your short- and long-term financial goals, and being realistic about your risk\u00a0tolerance. It's always a good idea to seek the advice of a financial professional before investing. You have plenty of options for investing your $100,000 including building and managing a portfolio of investments. You might be able to go at it alone, picking your stocks, bonds, and other securities if you're a savvy investor. Enlisting the services of a licensed financial advisor makes sense if you're a novice. These professionals create investment solutions that help you achieve your financial goals. They can also manage how and where to invest your money in addition to making recommendations. Understanding how your money will be taxed is crucial for protecting it and determining where you should put it because investments can produce different tax situations. You'll want to consider tax-efficient investments if your $100,000 came to you tax-free. Consider rollover or transfer options that defer taxation and offer features that match your financial goals if the source of your $100,000 is a qualified retirement account. You could invest your $100,000 in real estate, real estate investment trusts (REITs), stocks, or other securities. Thoroughly research your options and speak with a professional such as a broker or investment advisor to help you choose the investment that will generate the income you desire. It's possible to make $1 million from a $100,000 investment but this likely requires long-term investing. Some investments can generate monstrous returns quickly but they're extremely risky. Financial advisors can help you choose what best suits your needs and aligns with your goals. Real estate flipping is one common real estate investment option. It involves purchasing, renovating, and later selling a property for profit. Real estate investors can also rent out their properties to generate monthly income while the property's value appreciates. Purchasing real estate requires a large amount of cash, however. Another option is to invest in a real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in income-producing real estate and requires less capital. You have $100,000 and want to know where to invest it. The recommended first step is to research your options to make an informed decision. Exercise due diligence so your funds land where you want. Plenty of options are available from real estate to managed portfolios. The journey to find the right investment can be rewarding.

            "title": "Best Investment Accounts for Young Investors",
            "content": "Roger Wohlner is an experienced financial writer, ghostwriter, and advisor with 20 years of experience in the industry. What are the best investment accounts for young investors? Though encouraged to invest for their future, which is good advice, the big question for young investors is how to get started. The types of investment accounts to consider can be particularly confusing. Retirement accounts can be tax-deferred. This means that the money invested in the account grows and compounds free of taxation year to year. Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and company-sponsored retirement accounts, such as 401(k), 403(b), and 457\u00a0plans,\u00a0are examples of tax-deferred retirement accounts, meaning that the money is not taxed until it is withdrawn for retirement. Remember that the money has to be from employment. You can't invest other money you might have, from an inheritance perhaps, into a retirement account. In many cases, there is a tax break upfront when the money is contributed to these accounts. Workplace retirement plans allow you to make contributions from each paycheck. The contribution amount is withdrawn, leaving less income to be taxed. In the case of a traditional IRA, contributions are made in a similar fashion to a 401(k), with pre-tax dollars, and can be tax-deductible. An IRA or a 401(k) contribution might be one of the few tax breaks available for a younger worker, an added benefit for doing something you should do anyway. A contribution to a Roth IRA is made with after-tax employment income\u2014in other words, money on which you've\u00a0already paid taxes. As with a traditional IRA or 401(k), the money grows free of taxes while invested. However, at retirement, the money can be withdrawn completely tax-free if certain rules are followed. Note that you can only open a Roth IRA account if your income is below a certain level. That makes these a good option for younger investors, as their income may be lower and the benefit of the current-year tax breaks is not as valuable as it will be down the road when their income rises. Taxable accounts can include brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit (CD), higher-interest depository accounts, and accounts with mutual fund companies. Gains and interest from these accounts are taxable each year as incurred. Losses can also be deducted in many cases. With a taxable account, you generally have greater access to your money without worrying about the taxes and potential penalties that can come with a tax-deferred or Roth account. Your 401(k) plan will not offer you a choice of where to open an account and will come with a set investment menu through your employer. As for other types of accounts, you have a lot of choices. Taxable accounts and IRAs can be opened at many popular investment custodians, such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, and a host of others. Additionally, many mutual fund companies offer account options as well. Robo advisors such as Betterment, Ellevest, Titan, Acorns, SoFi, and Wealthfront are also an option. These technology-based advisors invest your money in low-cost investment options, such as exchange traded funds (ETFs), based on computer algorithms tied to your specific needs and goals. This can be a great option for someone just starting out, with little money to invest and with a preference for a mobile-based service with no human interaction. In today\u2019s online world there are many new types of accounts and account providers. There is even an app called Acorns that rounds up the amount from purchases from linked accounts and invests your \u201cspare change.\u201d Technology can enable many wonderful twists on basic savings and brokerage accounts, for example by using personal finance apps to manage your accounts. As with any type of financial account or transaction, be sure you understand how the account and its technology works, who is behind it, and if it is right for you. CDs and other vehicles for saving are available at banks and many brokerage firms. In fact, the lines separating traditional financial service providers are blurring as more firms attempt to offer a full range of accounts and services. Investing is a lifelong activity, and getting started is sometimes the hardest part. Understanding the different types of accounts available to you is a good first step in this process.

            "title": "The Costs of Investing",
            "content": "STR\u00a0/\u00a0Contributor / Getty Images All investments carry costs\u2014real costs\u2014not merely the opportunity costs of an investor choosing to forego one asset in favor of another. Rather, these costs and comparisons are not that dissimilar to those consumers face when shopping for a car. Unfortunately, many investors ignore critical investment costs because they can be confusing or obscured by fine print and jargon. But they don't have to be. The first step is understanding the different types of costs. Different investments carry different types of costs. For example, all mutual funds\u2014one of the most common investment instruments\u2014charge what\u2019s called an expense ratio. This is a measure of what it costs to manage the fund expressed as a percentage. It is based on the total assets invested in the fund and is calculated annually. This fee is typically paid out of fund assets, so you won\u2019t be billed for it, but it will come out of your returns. That means if the mutual fund returns 8% and the expense ratio is 1.5%, you\u2019ve really only earned 6.5% on your shares. There are two problems with a high expense ratio. First, a higher portion of your money is going to the management team instead of to you. Second, the more money the management team charges, the more difficult it is for the fund to match or beat the market\u2019s performance. Ironically, many higher-cost funds claim they\u2019re worth the extra cost because they enjoy stronger performance. But, expense ratios, like a leak in a bathtub, slowly drain some of the assets. Therefore, the more money management takes out in the form of fees, the better the fund must perform to earn back what\u2019s been deducted. Moreover, in some cases, these fees help pay for marketing or distribution costs. This means that you are paying managers to promote a fund to other potential investors. This particular cost is called a 12b-1 fee. Annual fees are often low, about $25 to $90 a year, but every dollar adds up. Custodian fees usually apply to retirement accounts (e.g., IRAs) and cover costs associated with fulfilling IRS reporting regulations. You can expect to pay anywhere from $10 to $50 per year. A front-end load is a fee charged when you buy shares, a back-end load is a fee incurred when selling. Commissions are essentially fees that are paid to the broker for their services. As you can see, the financial world has not made it easy to untangle all of these complex and often hidden expenses; however, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken steps to clarify these costs for investors. In an effort to protect retail investors, the SEC, in its 2018 priority list, indicated its intent to \u201cfocus on firms that have practices or business models that may create increased risks that investors will pay inadequately disclosed fees, expenses, or other charges.\u201d In other words, the SEC planned to take aim at firms that engage in practices like receiving compensation for recommending specific securities, ignoring accounts when the assigned manager has left the firm, and changing fee structures from commission-only to a percentage of client assets under management. While the SEC plays a valuable role in safeguarding investors, the best defense against excessive or unwarranted fees is doing careful research and asking plenty of questions. Taking the time to understand what you\u2019re paying is critical because fees, over the long term, rob investors of their wealth. Some mutual funds include other costs, like purchase and redemption fees, which are a percentage of the amount you\u2019re buying or selling. Fees almost always appear deceptively low. An investor might see an expense ratio of 2% and dismiss it as inconsequential. But it\u2019s not. A fee expressed as a percentage doesn\u2019t reveal to investors the dollars they\u2019ll actually be spending, and more importantly\u00a0how those dollars will grow. Just as compounding delivers growing returns to long-term investors, high fees do exactly the opposite; a static cost rises exponentially over time. The result may be anchoring bias, in which irrelevant information is used to evaluate or estimate something of unknown values. Simply put, everything is relative. This means that if our first exposure to investing involves excessive fees, we may view all subsequent expenses as low even though they are, in fact, high. Suppose you have an investment account worth $80,000. You hold the investment for 25 years, earning 7% per year and paying 0.50% in annual fees. At the end of the 25-year period, you\u2019ll have approximately $386,000. Now, consider the same scenario, but with one difference; you aren\u2019t paying attention to costs and you hand over 2.0% annually. After 25 years you\u2019re left with approximately $271,000. That \u201ctiny\u201d 2.0% cost you $115,000. This is usually an annual or monthly fee charged for the use of the brokerage firm and its research tools. This fee is occasionally tiered. Those who want to use more robust data and analytic tools pay more. As mentioned above, some mutual funds include a load or a commission paid to the broker who sold you the fund. Be wary of these charges for two reasons. First, many mutual funds today are no-load and are therefore cheaper alternatives. Second, some brokers will push funds with larger loads to pad revenue. This is also sometimes referred to as a management fee for the expertise the broker brings to the table in the form of wealth strategies. This cost is a percentage of the total assets the investor has under the broker's management. As discussed earlier, this is a fee charged by those managing the mutual fund. These are common and they add up fast. As mentioned above, commission fees are the cost of executing any buy or sell trade. This payment goes directly to the broker. This cost usually ranges from $1 to $5 per trade and, in some cases, will be waived if the investor reaches an account minimum.\u00a0Occasionally this fee is calculated as a percentage of the value of the trade. Remember that full-service brokers who provide complex services and products like estate planning, tax advice, and annuities, will often charge higher fees. Fees range between 0.5% and 1.0% of the value of the assets managed. The burden of expensive fees becomes greater over a longer period. Therefore, young investors just getting started face a bigger risk because the total dollars lost to costs will grow exponentially over the decades. For this reason, it\u2019s particularly important to pay attention to costs in accounts that you will hold for a long period of time. Passive management describes investments like mutual funds that are designed to replicate market indexes like the S&P 500 or the Russell 2000. The managers of these funds only change the holdings if the benchmarked fund changes. Passive management seeks to match the market\u2019s return. An example of actively managed funds is hedge funds, which seek to significantly outperform the market; however, studies have shown that hedge funds still can't beat the S&P 500. In contrast, an active management strategy is a more involved approach, with fund managers making a concerted effort to outperform the market. Not happy with simply matching the return of the S&P 500, they want to make strategic moves that seek to exploit the value of unrecognized opportunity in the market. Active and passive funds carry different costs. The average fee for actively managed funds in 2023 was 0.42%, whereas passive mutual funds averaged just 0.05%. Despite a continued decline since the 1990s, it's important to note that as the total amount of assets in an actively managed fund decreases, these funds, in general, raise the expense ratio. As one study from ICI Research determined, \u201cDuring the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis, actively managed domestic equity mutual fund assets decreased markedly, leading their expense ratios to rise in 2009.\u201d This finding underscores an important truth: Expense ratios are often not tied to performance. Instead, they\u2019re tied to the total value of assets under management. If the assets decrease\u2014usually due to poor performance\u2014the managers will simply raise their prices. Some investors will argue that \u201cyou get what you pay for.\u201d In other words, while an active fund may charge more, the higher returns are worth the expense because investors will earn back the fee and then some. In fact, these advocates for active management occasionally have the annual performance to back up such claims. There is, however, often a problem with this assertion: survivorship bias. Survivorship bias is the skewing effect that occurs when mutual funds merge with other funds or undergo liquidation. Why does this matter? Because \u201cwhen funds are merged into other funds or liquidated, and...tend to be underperformers\u2026this skews the average results upward for the surviving funds, causing them to appear to perform better relative to a benchmark,\u201d according to research at Vanguard. Of course, there are some actively managed funds that do outperform without the help of survivorship bias. The question here is do they outperform regularly? The answer is no. The same body of research from Vanguard shows that \"on average and over time, active managers as a group fail to outperform.\" The researchers looked at two separate, sequential, non-overlapping five-year periods. These funds were ranked into five quintiles based on their excess return ranking. Ultimately, they determined that while some managers did consistently outperform their benchmark, \u201cthose active managers are extremely rare.\u201d Moreover, it is nearly impossible for an investor to identify these consistent performers before they become consistent performers. In attempting to do so, many will look at previous results for clues on future performance; however, a critical tenet of investing is that past returns are no predictor of future gains. The more you move money around, the more costs accrue. As discussed above, there are fees and charges associated with buying and selling. Like a pail of water passed from one person to another, each successive hand-off causes a little spill. Moreover, buy-and-hold strategies typically yield better returns than those based on frequent trading. This is the most ignored aspect of investing costs. It's also the most complicated. Even seasoned investors find it beneficial to get help from a professional when it comes to taxes. The savings generated often more than compensate for the professional's fee. For example, many investors are unaware that realized losses on investments\u2014that is, money lost after selling a stock for less than it cost, can be used to offset taxable gains. This is called tax-loss harvesting. Ordinarily, an investor will pay either a long-term capital gains tax (securities held over one year) or short-term capital gains tax (securities held for less than one year). If it's a long-term capital gain the investor will pay either 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on their income level and their filing status (single, married filing jointly, married filing separately). Short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. These rates range from 10% to 37% again, depending on your income level and filing status. Investors might be surprised to see how much they hold on to with a tax-deferred, or tax-exempt account. Tax-deferred accounts, which safeguard investments from taxes as long as the assets remain untouched, include 401(k)s and traditional IRAs. These account options are great ways to save big on burdensome taxes. However, there\u2019s a catch. As mentioned earlier, you\u2019ll lose the tax advantage (and get hit with penalty costs) if you withdraw money early; before the age of 59\u00bd. Younger investors should consider Roth IRA accounts. Provided you have owned the Roth for five years, both earnings\u00a0and withdrawals made after 59\u00bd are tax-free. These are great ways to save over the long term if you know you won\u2019t need to touch the money. Common fees investors incur when investing are expense ratios, investment management/advisory fees, transaction fees, load fees, surrender charges, commissions, account fees, and custodian fees. To avoid or reduce investment fees, start out with no-fee brokers. Most online brokers now do not charge fees or commissions for transacting buy and sell orders of stocks. Utilize low-cost index funds with low expense ratios. Similarly, choose no-load mutual funds. Using a free robo-advisor can also be a good strategy. Fees impact investments by creating costs that reduce the returns an individual has achieved on their investment. This is particularly true if an investor buys and sells often and each transaction has a fee. It is also true if a long-term investor has to pay an annual fee for their investment portfolio. Small fees add up over time. Do your homework. We live in times of unprecedented access to information. While some investments may obscure their costs in the fine print, anyone can quickly get to the bottom line with the wealth of information available online. There\u2019s no excuse for investing in an asset without knowing the full costs and making the choices that are right for you.

Although markets may change, this investing advice is timeless. 1. \"An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.\" \u2014 Benjamin Franklin When it comes to investing, nothing will pay off more than educating yourself. Do the necessary research and analysis before making any investment decisions. 2. \"Bottoms in the investment world don't end with four-year lows; they end with 10- or 15-year lows.\" \u2014 Jim Rogers While 10- to 15-year lows are not common, they do happen. During these times, don't be shy about going against the trend and investing; you could make a fortune by making a bold move or lose your shirt. Remember the first quote in this article and invest in an industry you've researched thoroughly. Then, be prepared to see your investment sink lower before it turns around and starts to pay off. 3. \"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful.\" \u2014 Warren Buffett Be prepared to invest in a down market and to \"get out\" in a soaring market, as per the philosophy of Warren Buffett. 4. \"With a good perspective on history, we can have a better understanding of the past and present, and thus a clear vision of the future.\" \u2014 Carlos Slim Helu It's far too easy for investors to lose perspective. Whenever something big goes wrong, a lot of people panic and sell their investments. Looking at history, the markets recovered from the 2008 financial crisis, the dotcom crash, and even the Great Depression, so they'll probably get through whatever comes next as well. 5. \"It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong.\" \u2014 George Soros Too many investors become obsessed with being right, even when the gains are small. Winning big and cutting your losses when you're wrong is more important than being right. 6. \"Given a 10% chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time.\" \u2014 Jeff Bezos Most people dismiss many of the best and most profitable investment ideas simply because they probably won't work. These investors never stop to consider how much they could make if unlikely outcomes actually occur. Jeff Bezos took those bets and became one of the richest people in the world. 7. \"Don't look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack!\" \u2014 John Bogle If it seems too hard to find the next Amazon, John Bogle came up with the only sure way to get in on the action. By buying an index fund, investors can put a little bit of money into every stock. That way, they never miss out on the stock market's biggest winners. 8. \"To the extent we have been successful, it is because we concentrated on identifying one-foot hurdles that we could step over rather than because we acquired any ability to clear seven-footers.\" \u2014 Warren Buffett Investors often make things too hard for themselves. The value stocks that Buffett prefers frequently outperform the market, making success easier. Supposedly sophisticated strategies, such as short selling, lose money in the long run, so profiting is much more difficult. 9. \"The stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing.\" \u2014 Phillip Fisher That is another testament to the fact that investing without education and research will ultimately lead to regrettable investment decisions. Research is much more than just listening to popular opinion. 10. \"In investing, what is comfortable is rarely profitable.\" \u2014 Robert Arnott At times, you will have to step out of your comfort zone to realize significant gains. Know the boundaries of your comfort zone and practice stepping out of it in small doses. As much as you need to know the market, you need to know yourself too. Can you handle staying in when everyone else is jumping ship? Or getting out during the biggest rally of the century? There's no room for pride in this kind of self-analysis. The best investment strategy can turn into the worst if you don't have the stomach to see it through. 11. \"How many millionaires do you know who have become wealthy by investing in savings accounts? I rest my case.\" \u2014 Robert G. Allen Though investing in a savings account is a sure bet, your gains will be minimal due to the extremely low interest rates. But don't forgo one completely. A savings account is a reliable place for an emergency fund, whereas a market investment is not. 12. \"If there is one common theme to the vast range of the world\u2019s financial crises, it is that excessive debt accumulation, whether by the government, banks, corporations, or consumers, often poses greater systemic risks than it seems during a boom.\" \u2014 Carmen Reinhart Beware of debts that seem sensible during periods of prosperity. When a crisis comes, individuals, companies, and even governments that ran up debts during the boom usually suffer the most. 13. \"We don't prognosticate macroeconomic factors, we're looking at our companies from a bottom-up perspective on their long-run prospects of returning.\" \u2014 Mellody Hobson It's very difficult to predict when the next recession or stock market crash will come, so many of the best investors don't even try. Instead, look for good companies with the strength to make it through the occasional challenging economic environment. 14. \"Courage taught me no matter how bad a crisis gets ... any sound investment will eventually pay off.\" \u2014 Carlos Slim Helu Don't despair amid the inevitable setbacks that all investors face, especially during a crisis in the market. If the reasoning behind the investment is sound, stick with it, and it should eventually turn around. 15. \"The individual investor should act consistently as an investor and not as a speculator.\" \u2014 Ben Graham You are an investor, not someone who can predict the future. Base your decisions on real facts and analysis rather than risky, speculative forecasts. 16. \"The biggest risk of all is not taking one.\" \u2014 Mellody Hobson There is a direct tradeoff between risk and returns. If investors stick to low-risk assets like the money market and bonds, then they run a high risk of low long-term returns. 17. \"Returns matter a lot. It's our capital.\" \u2014 Abigail Johnson The long-run rate of return on investments ultimately determines how much wealth people accumulate over time. Always look at returns when considering mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 18. \"It's not how much money you make, but how much money you keep, how hard it works for you, and how many generations you keep it for.\" \u2014 Robert Kiyosaki If you're a millionaire by the time you're 30 but blow it all by age 40, you've gained nothing. Grow and protect your investment portfolio by carefully diversifying it, and you may find yourself funding many generations to come. 19. \"Know what you own, and know why you own it.\" \u2014 Peter Lynch Do your homework before making a decision. Once you've made a decision, make sure to re-evaluate your portfolio on a timely basis. A wise holding today may not be a wise holding in the future. 20. \"Financial peace isn't the acquisition of stuff. It's learning to live on less than you make, so you can give money back and have money to invest. You can't win until you do this.\" \u2014 Dave Ramsey By being modest in your spending, you can ensure you will have enough for retirement and can give back to the community as well. 21. \"Investing should be more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take $800 and go to Las Vegas.\" \u2014 Paul Samuelson If you think investing is gambling, you're doing it wrong. The work involved requires planning and patience. However, the gains you see over time are indeed exciting. Many of the best quotes about investing urge thoughtfulness over impulsiveness, boldness instead of caution, and smart research over flavor-of-the-month decision-making. 22. \"The four most dangerous words in investing are, it\u2019s different this time.\" \u2014 Sir John Templeton Follow market trends and history. Don't speculate that this particular time will be any different. For example, a major key to investing in a specific stock or bond fund is its performance over five years. 23. \"Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing.\" \u2014 Warren Buffett In the beginning, diversification is relevant. However, there are dangers of over-diversifying your portfolio. Once you've gotten your feet wet and have confidence in your investments, you can adjust your portfolio accordingly and make bigger bets. 24. \"You get recessions, you have stock market declines. If you don't understand that's going to happen, then you're not ready, you won't do well in the markets.\" \u2014 Peter Lynch When hit with recessions or declines, you must stay the course. Economies are cyclical, and the markets have shown that they will recover. Make sure you are a part of those recoveries. 25. \"The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.\" \u2014 Peter Thiel As a beginner, it's usually recommended to start investing with an amount you feel comfortable risking. Many experts suggest a percentage of your income, such as 10% to 15%. It can even be less. Starting small allows you to get accustomed to market fluctuations and see how your investment choices perform without too much financial pressure. It's also helpful to consider low-cost, diversified options like index funds or ETFs, as these reduce the risk of putting all your money into one stock. Diversifying your portfolio involves spreading your investments across different asset classes, sectors, and regions. This approach minimizes risk because different investments often perform differently in response to market events. For instance, you could allocate funds into stocks, bonds, real estate, and high-yield savings. Within stocks, consider a mix of industries (e.g., healthcare, consumer goods), and geographic markets. Low-cost index funds or ETFs are also effective for achieving broad diversification with minimal effort. While a savings account is safe and provides liquidity, it offers lower returns, often below inflation rates. In contrast, the stock market historically provides long-term returns, allowing your money to grow more substantially over time. Stocks, although riskier, provide opportunities for compounding returns, meaning your money has the potential to generate more wealth over the years. For goals like retirement or major life expenses, stock investments are usually better suited than savings alone. The world of investing can be cold and hard. Refer back to these quotes when you're feeling shaky or confused about investing. How are they relevant to your experience? Do you have any favorite quotes to add? Is there something you're overlooking that you could be doing differently?

            "title": "Tips for Long-Term Investors in Volatile Markets",
            "content": "During volatile times, many investors get spooked and begin to question their long-term investment strategies. This is especially true for novice investors, who can often be tempted to pull out of the market altogether and wait on the sidelines until it seems safe to dive back in. The thing to realize is that market volatility is inevitable. It's the nature of the markets to move up and down over the short term. Trying to time the market\u00a0is extremely difficult. One solution is to maintain a long-term horizon and ignore the short-term fluctuations. For many investors, this is a solid strategy, but even long-term investors should know about volatile markets and the steps that can help them weather this volatility. In this article, we'll show you how to do just that. Volatility is a statistical measure of the tendency of a market or security to rise or fall sharply within a short period of time. It is typically measured by the standard deviation of the return of an investment over a certain period. Standard deviation is a statistical concept that denotes the amount of variation or deviation that might be expected and is the square root of the variance of returns. The volatility of different types of investments will vary based on how much and how often their prices or returns move in a time period. For example, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) may have a standard deviation of around 15%, while a more stable investment, such as a certificate of deposit (CD), will typically have a standard deviation of nearly zero because the return never varies. Volatile markets are usually characterized by wide and rapid price fluctuations along with heavy trading. They can result from an imbalance of trade orders in one direction (for example, all buys and no sells). Some say volatile markets are caused by things like economic releases, company news, a recommendation from a well-known analyst, a popular initial public offering (IPO), or unexpected earnings results. Others blame volatility on day traders, short-sellers, and high-frequency firms. Volatility can also spike whenever fear or uncertainty in the market rises. One explanation is that investor reactions are caused by psychological forces. This theory, however, flies in the face of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), which states that market prices are correct and adjust to reflect all information. This behavioral approach says that substantial price changes (volatility) result from a collective change of mind by the investing public. It's clear there is no consensus on what causes volatility; but because volatility exists, investors must develop ways to deal with it. One way to deal with volatility is to avoid it altogether. This means staying invested and not paying attention to short-term fluctuations. Sometimes this can be harder than it sounds\u2014watching your portfolio take a 50% hit in a bear market can be more than most can take. But, the standard advice is that for most long-term investors, the best way to deal with volatile markets is to remain calm and stay the course. Staying the course, however, is predicated on having a well-diversified and sound strategy, to begin with. One common misconception about a buy-and-hold strategy is that holding a stock for 20 years is what will always make you money. Long-term investing still requires homework because markets are driven by corporate fundamentals. The average return of the S&P 500 from 2011 to 2021. If you find a company with a strong balance sheet and consistent earnings, the short-term fluctuations won't affect the long-term value of the company. In fact, periods of volatility could be a great time to buy if you believe a company is good for the long term. The main argument behind the buy-and-hold strategy is that missing the best few days of the year will cut your return significantly. It varies depending on where you get your data, but the statistic will usually sound something like this: \"Missing the 20 best days could cut your return by more than half.\" For the most part, this is true.\u00a0But\u00a0on the other hand, missing the worst 20 days will also increase your portfolio considerably and in some cases, you may want to make trades during volatile market conditions. Investors, especially those that use an online broker, should know that during times of extreme volatility, many brokerages implement procedures designed to decrease the firm's exposure to extraordinary market risk. For example, in the past, some market-maker firms have temporarily discontinued normal automatic order executions and handled orders manually. How securities are executed during times of volatile prices and high volume is also different in other ways. The following are some things you should be aware of: The type of order you choose is very important when the markets aren't moving in their normal fashion. A market order will always be executed, but, in fast markets, you might be surprised at what price you get. It can be substantially different from the quoted price. In a volatile market, the limit order\u2014an order placed with a brokerage to buy or sell at a predetermined amount of shares and at or better than a specified price\u2014is your friend. Limit orders may cost slightly more than market orders but are always a good idea to use because the price at which you will purchase or sell securities is set. On the flip side, a limit order does not guarantee you an execution if the limit price is never triggered. Investors need to be aware of the potential risks during times of volatility. Choosing to stay invested can be a great option if you're confident in your strategy. If, however, you do decide to trade during a spike in volatility, be aware of how the market conditions will affect your trade. In general, the answer is no (with caveats). Over time, market volatility subsides, and prices increase. Maintaining a long-term strategy through rocky patches can also allow you to accumulate more shares when stocks are on sale. If, however, you are in a position where you need the value of your assets fairly immediately or for income to live on (for instance, if you're a retiree), it may be best to rotate out of stocks and into more conservative investments when volatility strikes. For long-term investors, buying into a down market can be a way to lower the dollar-cost-average (DCA) and pick up shares at better prices. If you were planning to buy $100 of stocks every month anyway over the course of several years, for instance, a volatile market can create lucrative buying opportunities. If you want to limit losses but do not want to sell your holdings, you can buy protective puts. These are options contracts that give you the right to sell the underlying stock or index at a specified price. You can set that specified price at some level below the current market, below which you want to be stopped out for losses (e.g., 10% below the current price). Buying options does incur some cost, so think of it as buying insurance on your portfolio. Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. \"Benchmark Study: Thrift Savings Plan, October 2017,\" Page 12.

He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. The old saying that it takes money to make money is true. For those living paycheck to paycheck, there often isn't enough money left over to put toward investing. When you need the money now, finding a broker for an individual retirement account (IRA) and investing in the stock market might be far down on your priority list. However, by reading this article and gaining knowledge, you are taking one of the necessary first steps in building a retirement nest egg. The fact remains that you must put money away for later years or face a possible catastrophic situation. Someday, you won't be able to work and Social Security won't be enough to live on\u2014assuming the fund is around in 20 or 30 years. You can start investing now with less money than you think it will take. First, we have to solve the problem of limited funds and the advice isn't new or revolutionary. Something in your life has to go, but it doesn't have to be a big life change. Simple changes that save $1 here and $5 there can add up to make a big impact. We've put together a few ideas for those people who don't see any available funds for investing. As with anything else, make sure you consult a financial professional about your investment options. This is especially important if you're trying to juggle saving while paying off your debts. Dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPS) allow you to invest small amounts of money into a dividend-paying stock, by purchasing directly from the company. Companies like GE, Coca-Cola, Verizon, Home Depot, and Johnson & Johnson are just a few of the companies that allow you to make regular purchases of very small amounts of stock, and reinvest the dividends. This can add up to a big investment over time and, as you gain a larger balance, you may consider diverting some of these funds into other investments. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are financial products that track the performance of a certain sector of the investment market. You can buy as little as one share of an ETF through a broker, and some of these ETFs track the performance of the total stock market, the bond market, and many others. Many ETFs also pay a dividend, so purchasing a fund like the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) will bring exposure to an instantly diversified portfolio that also pays a dividend. Target-date funds, as the name implies, target your retirement date by changing the percentage of stocks and bonds to ensure that your money remains safe as you approach retirement age. Some of these funds require a minimum investment of $1,000, but they may serve as great products for investors who don't want to manage their portfolios on their own. But make sure you use caution when picking a target-date fund because of the high fees that some of these vehicles charge. The 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that allows you to put away a portion of your paycheck into an investment account. The plan comes with tax savings depending on the type of plan you have: If you have a 401(k) that will match your contributions, invest there first. Since your company is giving you free money to invest, you should consider funding your 401(k) before outside investments. If you have some money saved or invested, you want to see it grow over time. Many factors can prevent this from happening. Debt is one of the biggest obstacles for some people. If you have a sizable amount of debt to deal with, whether it's a mortgage, line of credit (LOC), student loan, or credit card, you can still learn how to balance your debt with saving and investing. Having debt can make it very difficult for investors to make money. In some cases, investing while in debt is like trying to bail out a sinking ship with a coffee cup. For instance, if you owe money on a LOC with 7%\u00a0interest, the money you put aside will have to make more than 7% (after taxes and fees) to make it more profitable than paying down the debt. Some investments deliver such high returns, but you have to be able to find them, knowing you are under the burden of debt. It is important to briefly distinguish between the different kinds of debt that\u00a0may be incurred. High interest is relative, but anything above 10%\u00a0is a good candidate for this category. Having said that, you can probably count your credit card as a high-interest debt. Carrying any kind of balance on your credit card or similar high-interest vehicle makes paying it down a priority before starting to invest. This type of low-interest debt\u00a0may often\u00a0be a car loan, a line of credit, or a personal loan from a bank. The interest rates are usually described as a prime plus or minus a certain percentage, so there is still some performance pressure from investing with this type of debt. It is, however, much less daunting to make a portfolio that returns 12%\u00a0than one that has to return 25%. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that your credit score determines your interest rate. The better your score, the lower your rate. But if you have a less-than-stellar credit history, the chance of obtaining a low-interest loan may be small. If there is such a thing as good debt, this is it. Tax-deductible debts include mortgages, student loans, business loans, investment loans, and all the other loans in which interest paid is returned to you in the form of tax deductions. Since this debt is generally low interest as well, you can easily build a portfolio while paying it down. The types of debt we focus on here are long-term low-interest and tax-deductible debt, such as mortgage payments. If you do have high-interest debt, you'll likely want\u00a0to focus on\u00a0paying it off before you begin your investing adventure. Not all interest-bearing loans are tax-deductible. Be sure to check with your lender or a financial professional whether you can deduct the interest on your loan. Debt elimination, particularly of something like a loan that will take long-term capital, robs you of time and money. In the long term, the time (in terms of the\u00a0compounding time of your investment) that you lose is worth more to you than the money you actually pay (in terms of the money and interest that you are paying to your lender). You want to give your money as much time as possible to compound. This is one of the reasons to start a portfolio despite carrying debt, but not the only one. Your investments may be small, but they will pay off more than investments you would make later in life because these small investments will have more time to mature. Instead of making a traditional portfolio with high- and low-risk investments that are adjusted according to your tolerance and age, the idea is to make your loan payments in place of low-risk and/or fixed-income investments. This means that you will be seeing returns from decreasing your debt load and interest payments rather than the 2% to 8%\u00a0return on a bond or similar investment. The rest of your portfolio should focus on higher-risk, high-return investments like stocks. If your risk tolerance is very low, the bulk of your investing money will still be going toward loan payments, but there will be a percentage that does make it into the market to produce returns for you. Even if you have a high-risk tolerance, you may not be able to put as much as you'd like into your investment portfolio because, unlike bonds, loans require a certain amount in monthly payments. Your debt load may force you to create a conservative portfolio with\u00a0most of your money being invested in your loans and\u00a0only a little going into your high-risk and return investments. As the debt gets smaller, you can adjust your distributions accordingly. Before you start investing, it is wise to have your finances in as much order as possible. The first step would be to save up cash in an emergency fund, usually three to six months of your salary. The next would be to start paying down high-interest debt, such as credit card debt. Once that is resolved, it is wise to start putting money in a retirement plan, such as a 401(k) at work or an IRA. This should be a monthly contribution and is investing. From there, you can start investing outside of retirement plans, even if it is a small amount of money. A simple way to start investing is to choose an ETF, such as one that tracks the S&P 500, which will give you exposure to the broad market. You do not need a lot of money to start investing. You can start investing in a retirement plan with any amount of money. If you have a 401(k) at work or your own IRA, putting any amount of money into the accounts will count as investing. If you want to invest in the stock market, having enough money to buy one share of a company's stock that you like will also be enough to get you started. A beginner should start investing with contributions to a retirement plan. They should then choose index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A good way to start is also by choosing a robo-advisor that will make investment decisions for you based on the criteria you decide. You can invest despite debt. The important question is whether or not you should. The answer to this question is personalized to your financial situation and risk tolerance. There are certainly\u00a0benefits from getting your money into the market as soon as possible, but there is also no guarantee that your portfolio will perform as expected. These things depend on your\u00a0investing strategy and market timing. The biggest benefit of investing while in debt is psychological. Paying down long-term debts can be tedious and disheartening if you are not the type of person who puts your shoulder into a task and keeps pushing until it is done. For many people who are servicing debt, it seems like they are struggling to get to the point where their regular financial life\u2014that of saving and investing\u2014can begin. Debt becomes like a limbo state where things seem to be happening in slow motion. By having even a modest portfolio to track, you can keep your enthusiasm about the growth of your personal\u00a0finances from ebbing. For some people, building a portfolio while in debt provides a much-needed ray of light.

            "title": "How to Use Benchmarks in Investing",
            "content": "Richard Rosen is a financial planner and an expert in writing about financial planning topics. He has 20+ years of experience as a CFP\u00ae. A\u00a0benchmark\u00a0is a standard or measure that can be used to analyze the allocation, risk, and return of a given portfolio. Individual funds and investment portfolios will generally have established benchmarks for standard analysis. A variety of benchmarks can also be used to understand how a portfolio is performing against various market segments. Investors often use the S&P 500 index as an equity performance benchmark because the S&P contains 500 of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies. However, there are many types of benchmarks that investors can use depending on their investments, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Benchmarks represent a portfolio of unmanaged securities that represent a designated market segment. Institutions manage these portfolios which are known as indexes. Some of the most common institutions known for index management are Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P), Russell, and MSCI. Indexes act as a market proxy and represent various investment asset classes. A benchmark can include broad measures, such as the\u00a0Russell 1000, or specific asset classes\u00a0like U.S. small-cap\u00a0growth stocks, high-yield bonds, or\u00a0emerging markets. Many mutual funds in the investment industry use indexes as the base for a replication strategy. Mutual funds contain pools of investment funds that are actively managed by portfolio managers and invested in various securities, such as stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. Fund\u00a0money managers attempt to produce capital gains or income for the fund's investors. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also use indexes as the base for a passive replication strategy. ETFs typically track an index, such as the S&P 500 for equity ETFs. These ETFs invest in all the securities of the underlying index which is why they're considered to be passively managed funds. Investing in a passive fund is the primary way that a retail investor can invest in an index. But the evolution of ETFs has brought about the introduction of smart beta indexes. These offer customized indexes that rival the capabilities of active managers. Smart beta indexes use advanced methodologies and a rules-based system for selecting investments to be held in portfolios. Smart beta funds represent the middle ground between a mutual fund and an ETF. A variety of benchmarks can also be used to understand how a portfolio is performing against various market segments. Most people invest in a diversified portfolio that includes numerous asset classes to help manage risk. They generally use equities and bonds.\u00a0Risk metrics can be used to help understand the risks of these investments. Risk is most often characterized using variability and volatility. The size of the change in portfolio value measures volatility. Investment funds that contain commodities that have larger moves up and down in value have an increased amount of volatility. Variability measures the frequency of the change in value. Overall, the more variability, the greater the risk. Several measures are used to evaluate portfolio risk and reward. Standard deviation is a statistical measure of volatility. It calculates the variance in price moves of an investment to the mean or average return over a period. The greater the variance between each price of the investment and the mean, the greater the price range or standard deviation. A higher standard deviation indicates more volatility and greater risk. Beta\u00a0is used to\u00a0measure volatility\u00a0against a benchmark. A portfolio with a beta of 1.2 is expected to move 120% up or down for every change in the benchmark. A portfolio with a lower beta would be expected to have less up-and-down movement than the benchmark. Beta is usually calculated with the S&P 500 as the benchmark. The\u00a0Sharpe Ratio\u00a0is a widely used measure of\u00a0risk-adjusted return. It's the\u00a0average return\u00a0earned more than a risk-free investment, such as a U.S.\u00a0government bond. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates a superior overall risk-adjusted return. These measures are commonly reported with managed investment funds and also by index providers. Fund companies use benchmarks as a gauge for the performance of a portfolio against its investing universe. Portfolio managers will generally choose a benchmark that's aligned with their investing universe. Active managers seek to outperform their benchmarks. They look to create a return beyond the return of the benchmark. But an investor can't necessarily invest in all the securities of an index because all investing comes with some associated fees that will detract from the return of an index. Investors can also use individual indexes combined with risk metrics to analyze their portfolios and choose portfolio allocations. Three benchmarks are commonly used for analyzing and understanding the market environment and various investment opportunities. An investor may want to use the S&P 500 index as a benchmark for equities because it's the best gauge for large U.S. publicly traded companies. The S&P is the most widely used benchmark for equities. It's typically the litmus test for a portfolio's or fund's performance. The Agg or the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index measures the performance of various fixed-income securities. These include corporate bonds, U.S. government bonds, asset-backed securities, and commercial mortgage-backed securities that are traded in the United States. The Agg is used by bond traders, mutual funds, and ETFs as a benchmark to measure the relative performance of the bond or fixed-income market. U.S. Treasury securities are bonds that typically pay a fixed rate of return and they're backed by the U.S. Treasury. Treasuries are considered to be as safe an investment as possible. Many investment funds and portfolio managers use short-term Treasuries maturing in one or two years as a benchmark for the risk-free rate of return. The investment isn't worth the risk for investors if the rate cannot beat a one-year Treasury security. An investor must first consider their risk to help determine an appropriate investment benchmark. An appropriate benchmark could be a 60% to 40% allocation if you're willing to take a moderate amount of risk because your profile is a six on a scale of 1-10. It would include: An investor would use the Russell 3000 Index as a benchmark for equity and the Bloomberg Agg as a benchmark for fixed income in this scenario. They might also want to use the Sharpe Ratio to ensure that they're optimally diversified and achieve the greatest reward in each allocation for their risk. Risk is a central component of all investing decisions. An investor can better understand how to allocate their investments most prudently by simply using the performance and risk metrics of an index in comparison to investments. Risk levels usually vary across equity, fixed-income, and savings investments. Most investors with longer time horizons are willing to invest more heavily in higher-risk investments. Shorter time horizons or a higher need for liquidity or the ability to convert to cash will lead to lower-risk investments in fixed-income and savings products. Investors can also use indexes and risk metrics to monitor their portfolios within the macro investing environment using these allocations as a guide. Markets can gradually shift their levels of risk depending on various factors. Economic cycles and monetary policies can be leading variables affecting risk levels. Active investors who use appropriate benchmarking analysis techniques can often more readily capitalize on investment opportunities as they evolve. Comparing the performance and risk of various benchmarks across an entire portfolio or specifically to investment fund mandates can also be important to ensure optimal investing. An index is effectively a benchmark. It's a measurement of changes in a securities market based on statistics. An index fund is a pooled investment vehicle that tracks specific indexes. Many mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) track and mimic the performance of indexes so they're considered to be safer than some other types of investments. An ETF is a pooled investment vehicle that's funded by numerous investors who receive an interest in the fund that's typically proportionate to their contributions. The fund is usually managed by an SEC-registered advisor firm. Some ETFs, such as index funds, are passively managed and track markets. Others are more actively managed and they trade on a more consistent basis. Whether should you invest in an ETF and which type of fund would work best for you can depend on your appetite for risk, but ETFs are considered to be on the safe side of investments overall. Volatility is a measurement of how frequently and by how much the price of a given security shifts over a designated period. It has less of an effect on long-term investors because their goal is growth over a matter of years. It can create a bumpy, nerve-wracking road for short-term investors who want to buy in or out of the market at a specific, imminent time. Benchmarks are tools that can be used in a variety of ways for investors. All managed funds will have an established benchmark by which you can measure the performance of the fund. Investors can also go beyond standard uses of benchmarking. Using indexes to allocate investments to passive funds with specific portfolio allocations can be one advanced use of benchmarking. Active investors may also choose to follow an array of benchmarks across the risk spectrum, analyzing these benchmarks along with risk characteristics to ensure that their investments are optimally placed with the lowest risk and highest return possible. Benchmark and risk metric monitoring also allow investors to potentially identify opportunities for shifting portfolio investments to take advantage of market opportunities. Considering different benchmarks simultaneously with their risk characteristics can be a simple technique for all types of investors. Using benchmarks can be very valuable in analyzing current and potential investments. It can also be an effective way to ensure that an investor\u2019s portfolio is optimally diversified and aligned with their goals.

            "content": "Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. The most successful investors were not made in a\u00a0day. Learning the ins and outs of the financial world and your personality as an investor\u00a0takes time and patience, not to mention trial and error. In this article, we'll lead you through the first seven steps of your expedition into investing and show you what to look out for along the way. Successful investing is a journey, not a one-time event, and you'll need to prepare yourself as if you were going on a long trip. Begin by defining your destination,\u00a0then plan your investment journey accordingly. For example, are you looking to retire in 20 years at age 55? How much money will you need to do this? You must first ask these questions. The plan that you come up with will depend on your investment goals. Read books or take an investment course that deals with modern financial ideas. The people who came up with theories such as portfolio optimization, diversification, and market efficiency received their Nobel prizes for good reason. Investing is a combination of science (financial fundamentals) and art (qualitative factors). The scientific aspect of finance is a solid place to start and should not be ignored. If science is not your strong suit, don't fret. There are many texts, such as Stocks for the long run\u00a0by Jeremy Siegel, that explain high-level finance ideas in a way that is easy to understand. Once you know what works in the market, you can come up with simple rules that work for you. For example, Warren Buffett is one of the most successful investors ever. His simple investment style is summed up in this well-known quote: \"Never invest in a business you cannot understand.\" It has served him well. While he missed the tech upturn, he avoided the subsequent devastating downturn of the high-tech bubble of 2000. Nobody knows you and your situation better than you do. Therefore, you may be the most qualified person to do your own investing\u2014all you need is a bit of help. Identify the personality traits that will\u00a0assist you or prevent you from investing successfully, and manage them accordingly. A very useful behavioral model that helps investors to understand themselves was developed by\u00a0fund managers Tom Bailard, Larry Biehl, and Ron Kaiser. The model classifies investors according to two personality characteristics: method of action (careful or impetuous) and level of confidence (confident or anxious). Based on these personality traits, the BB&K model divides investors into five groups: Not surprisingly, the best investment results tend to be realized by an individualist, or someone who exhibits analytical behavior and confidence and has a good eye for value. However, if you determine that your personality traits resemble those of an adventurer, you can still achieve investment success if you adjust your strategy accordingly. In other words, regardless of which group you fit into, you should manage your core assets in a systematic and disciplined way. Beware of false friends who only pretend to be on your side, such as certain unscrupulous investment professionals whose interests may conflict with yours. You must also remember that, as an investor, you are competing with large financial institutions that have more resources, including greater and faster access to information. Bear in mind you are potentially your own worst enemy. Depending on your personality, strategy, and particular circumstances, you may be sabotaging your own success. A guardian would be going against their personality type if they were to follow the latest market craze and seek short-term profits. Because you are risk-averse and a wealth preserver, you would be affected far more by large losses that can result from high-risk, high-return investments. Be honest with yourself, and identify and modify the factors preventing you from investing successfully or\u00a0moving you away from your comfort zone. Your level of knowledge, personality, and resources should determine the path you choose. Generally, investors adopt one of the following strategies: Most successful investors start with low-risk diversified portfolios and gradually learn by doing. As investors gain greater knowledge over time, they become better suited to taking a more active stance in their portfolios. Online brokers have an abundance of tools that can help investors of all levels; we've done an extensive review and ranking of more than 70 online brokers to find the best one for you. Sticking with the optimal long-term strategy may not be the most exciting investing choice. However, your chances of success should increase if you stay the course without letting your emotions, or \"false friends,\" get the upper hand. The market is hard to predict, but one thing is certain: it will be volatile. Learning to be a successful investor is a gradual process and the investment journey is typically a long one. At times, the market will prove you wrong. Acknowledge that and learn from your mistakes. The first step a new investor should take is to determine their investment goals \"Why are you investing?\" Are you planning for retirement? Saving up to buy a house? Knowing your goals will guide your investment decisions. From there, determine your investment vehicles, such as purchasing stocks, investing in ETFs or mutual funds, setting up a retirement account, and so on. You should also consider how much you want to invest as well as your time horizon. One of the best ways to start investing is by contributing to your retirement account at work if you have one. If your company has a 401(k) for example, you can start contributing there. If it does not, you can start retirement planning on your own with an IRA. From there, a simple way to invest is by putting money in an index fund; funds that track an index such as the S&P 500. These funds, particularly exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are easy to buy and sell, come with low fees, and provide a wide breadth of exposure to the markets. You can start investing with any amount of money. If you have a retirement plan at work, you can allocate part of your salary to contribute to the plan. If there is a stock you want to buy, you only need enough to buy one share to get started. Starting to invest can be an exciting time but also challenging for newcomers. There are lots of financial products and plenty of different investment advice out there. As you start, first educate yourself on investing, lay out your financial goals, and don't rush to make a fortune. Taking the time to learn about investing and carefully making the right choices for you should allow you to generate a tidy return. Jeremy J.

            "title": "How to Invest in Uncertain Times",
            "content": "Every day it seems like the world is more interconnected. If you watch any financial television channel or read the news online, you are most likely aware of how events in one country seem to have an ever-increasing effect on other countries around the world. Certain aspects of\u00a0globalization\u00a0can\u00a0have\u00a0positive benefits, but when threats of a financial crisis, war, global recession, trade imbalances, etc. do occur, it often leads to the talk of moving money to safer investments and increasing government deficits. This rising uncertainty can confuse even the well-informed investor. Any time you put money at risk in an attempt to profit, there is an inherent level of uncertainty. When new threats such as war or recession arise, the level of uncertainty increases significantly as companies can no longer accurately predict their future earnings. As a result, institutional investors will reduce their holdings in stocks considered unsafe and move the funds to other asset classes\u00a0like precious metals, government bonds, and money-market instruments. This sell-off, which occurs as large portfolios reposition themselves, can cause the stock market to depreciate. Uncertainty is the inability to forecast future events. People can't predict the extent of a possible recession, when it's going to start/end, how much it will cost, or what companies will be able to make it through unscathed. Most companies normally predict sales and production trends for the investing public to follow assuming normal market conditions, but increasing uncertainty levels can make these numbers significantly inaccurate. Uncertainty itself can affect the economy on both the micro and macro levels.\u00a0Uncertainty on a micro-level centers around\u00a0the effect on individual companies within an economy faced with the threat of war or recession, while uncertainty on a macro-level tends to look more\u00a0at the economy as a whole. From a micro-level, company-specific viewpoint, uncertainty provides a major concern for those that produce consumer goods every day. For example, consumption may fall on the threat of a recession as individuals refrain from purchasing new cars, gadgets,\u00a0and other non-essentials. This uncertainty may force companies in certain sectors to lay off some of their employees to combat the impacts of lower sales. The level of uncertainty that surrounds a company's sales also extends into the stock market. Consequently, stock prices of companies that produce non-essential goods sometimes experience a sell-off when levels of uncertainty rise. On a macro-level, uncertainty is magnified if the countries at war are major suppliers or consumers of goods. A good example is a country that supplies a large portion of the world's oil. Should this country go to war, uncertainty regarding the level of the world's oil reserves would grow. Because the demand for oil would be high and the supply uncertain, a country unable to produce enough oil within its own borders would be required to ensure that enough oil was stored to cover operations. As a result, the price of oil would increase. Another macro-level event that affects companies and investors is the flight of capital and devaluation of exchange rates. When a country faces the threat of war or recession, its economy is considered uncertain. Investors attempt to move their currency away from unstable sources to stable ones; the currency of a country under a threat of war may be\u00a0sold and the currencies from countries without the threat are bought instead. The average investor probably would not do this, but the large institutional investors and currency futures traders would. These actions translate into a devaluation of exchange rates. When situations of heightened uncertainty arise, the best defense is to be as well-informed as possible. Keep updated by following news that impacts markets\u00a0and researching individual companies. Analyze which sectors have more to gain and lose in a crisis, and decide on a long-term plan. Investing in gold has been a popular strategy during hard economic times, primarily because gold has an intrinsic value. Times of heightened uncertainty can lead to great opportunities for investors who position themselves to take advantage of it. Some investors might decide to go on the\u00a0offensive and search for companies that provide goods or services that will lead to great returns when things turn around. It is difficult to commit capital during uncertain times, but it can often reap huge rewards in the long run. Those who want to mitigate uncertainty and risk might be content leaving their money where it is or perhaps moving it to safer securities. Diversification is always a key investing tactic and not only in times of uncertainty. Having your investments spread across a variety of assets, such as stocks, bonds, and precious metals, helps soften the blow if one area depreciates quickly. Furthermore, investing in different regions and different sectors and industries also increases diversification. For example, if you had all of your investments in oil companies and oil prices took a dive because of an outbreak of war in the Middle East, you are at a significant risk of loss. Now, if you also had investments in the technology sector and renewable energy, your portfolio would not be impacted as much. Regardless of which strategy you decide to take (if any), you can't go wrong over the long term by keeping yourself well-informed and getting into a position to take advantage of prices when things reverse. Being able to keep on top of news and adjust your portfolio accordingly will help you to invest wisely during uncertain times."

            "title": "How New York Became the Center of American Finance",
            "content": "Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street. New York City is not only the financial capital of America but also of the world. While the city's financial dealings grew out of Wall Street, at the southern tip of Manhattan, large financial institutions and companies are now spread out throughout the city. Though New York's power in American finance is undisputed, it was not always this way. The very first bank and stock exchange in the U.S. were actually established in Philadelphia, PA, and for a time, it was that city, and not New York, that stood as the pillar of the American financial world. Despite Philadelphia\u2019s first-mover advantage, however, several geographic, economic, and political factors helped The Big Apple overtake the city of brotherly love to become the nation\u2019s leading financial center. One of the first signs of Philadelphia\u2019s initial financial supremacy came with the establishment of the Bank of Pennsylvania in 1780 and its role in helping to finance the Revolutionary War. As the nation\u2019s largest city and acting capital during the last decade of the 18th century, it would become the location for the nation\u2019s first federally chartered bank\u2014the First Bank of the United States. Acting as a de facto central bank, it established Philadelphia as the initial center of American finance. The failure of the First Bank to renew its charter in 1811 for political reasons did not disrupt this supremacy, as financial instability following the War of 1812 would help to bring about the chartering of the Second Bank of the United States in 1816, also located in Philadelphia. As the nation\u2019s only federally chartered bank\u2014and given the special privileges that came with it\u2014the bank exerted its power and influence over the rest of the nation\u2019s state-chartered banks, which was notable in the\u00a0history of U.S. banking regulation. Philadelphia\u2019s stock exchange further illustrated its place as the leading financial center. Indeed, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, established in 1790, is older than the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and even as late as 1815, London banks looked to Philadelphia rather than New York to buy American securities. Realizing the dominance of Philadelphia\u2019s security exchange market, New York decided to formalize its exchange by establishing the New York Stock and Exchange Board in 1817, which later became the NYSE. With a new exchange and home to more banks than its southern competitor, New York looked to lure investors away from Philadelphia. By this time, New York had already surpassed Philadelphia as the nation\u2019s leader in commercial trade. It was a top coastal trade city by 1789, overtaking Philadelphia in the value of imports in 1796, and in the value of exports in the following year. While New York\u2019s superiority in commercial trade was clearly evident by 1815, it wasn't until the Erie Canal was completed in 1825 that New York's ascendancy became clear. New York\u2019s supremacy in trade has a lot to do with geographical factors, but it was also helped by many more contingent developments. Not only was New York a central location for inbound European merchants, but its ports proved to be much more convenient than either Philadelphia\u2019s or Boston\u2019s. Being deeper, the Hudson River proved to be much more navigable and less prone to freezing over than both the Delaware\u00a0River and the Charles River. New York\u2019s geographical advantage was supplemented by the construction of the Erie Canal (1817\u20131825) and the establishment of Black Ball Lines in 1818. While the Erie Canal connected the Hudson River to the Great Lakes and consequently to the fastest-growing parts of America west of the Appalachian Mountains, the Black Ball Line provided the first-ever regularly scheduled transatlantic passenger service. Both the Canal and the Line helped to solidify New York\u2019s place as America\u2019s center of commercial trade and central transportation hub. As the first port of entry for many immigrants, New York became a convenient place for them to settle, helping stimulate an unstoppable rise in the city\u2019s population that would grow to be 10% larger than Philadelphia\u2019s by 1820 and as much as twice as large by 1860. The flow of immigrants also helped to increase manufacturing and commercial activity even further. The largest bank in the U.S. by total assets is JPMorgan Chase, which is headquartered in New York City. These new immigrants also brought with them a more adventurous risk-taking spirit that stood in contrast to the more cautious nature of Philadelphia\u2019s Quaker heritage. As a result, New York quickly developed a reputation for being a city of innovative business enterprise with an entrepreneurial ethos that lent itself to speculative investment behavior. Speculation further enhanced the voluminous trade in New York\u2019s securities markets by keeping them awash with liquidity. In order to finance the increasing amount of stock trading in New York, a market for call loans developed. Using securities as collateral, stock traders could borrow money from the banks to be used for further speculative investments. This behavior proved mutually beneficial for New York\u2019s banks, and its stock market as the banks earned interest off of the loans while the borrowed money allowed for further securities trading. By the 1830s, having become the nation\u2019s dominant commercial center, Wall Street was now keeping the major deposit balances of all of America\u2019s banks. The only thing really keeping New York from claiming the title of the nation\u2019s leading financial center was the existence of the Philadelphia-located Second Bank of the United States, whose charter\u00a0was set to expire in 1836. What had become extremely irritating to Wall Street bankers was the fact that New York was the main source of Federal Customs receipts, but rather than being deposited in New York banks, they were deposited at the Second Bank. While then-President Andrew Jackson had his own reasons for being antagonistic towards the Second Bank, the Wall Street bankers\u2019 interests were given a voice through Martin Van Buren, an influential New Yorker who became Jackson\u2019s advisor. Regardless of the precise motives, the Second Bank of the United States failed to renew its charter in 1836, essentially determining New York\u2019s fate as the center of American finance. This fate would be further strengthened by the National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864, which would put New York at the top of a hierarchical banking structure. The 1864 version of the act stipulated that all national banks must maintain 15% reserves of lawful money in New York. New York is the economic capital of the world because many of the largest companies in the world, specifically financial institutions, are headquartered there. Also, New York has the largest and the second-largest stock markets in the world. These markets are the center of global financial markets and include some of the largest corporations in the world. The financial capital of Europe is London. It contains large stock markets, banks, and other financial institutions. Much of the financial business done in Europe is done in or through London. Even after Brexit, London remains the foremost financial center in Europe. The largest stock market in the world by market capitalization is the New York Stock Exchange. As of 2023, it had a market cap of $25.24 trillion. Despite being home to the nation\u2019s first bank and stock exchange, Philadelphia\u2019s initial advantages would not be enough for it to maintain its financial dominance over New York City\u2019s growing influence. By utilizing its unique geographical features, New York was able to overtake Philadelphia as the nation\u2019s transportation and immigration hub. From there, New York quickly surpassed its southern competitor in commercial trade and finally gained American financial supremacy\u2014a role that it maintains to this day.

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate.  Pattanaphong Khuankaew / EyeEm\u00a0/ Getty Images While the stock market is riddled with uncertainty, certain tried-and-true principles can help investors boost their chances for long-term success. Some investors lock in profits by selling their appreciated investments while holding onto underperforming stocks they hope will rebound. But good stocks can climb further, and poor stocks risk zeroing out completely. Below we discuss 10 tips for successful long-term investing that can help you prevent mistakes and hopefully generate some profits. Peter Lynch famously spoke about \"tenbaggers\"\u2014investments that increased tenfold in value. He attributed his success to a small number of these stocks in his\u00a0portfolio. But this required the discipline of hanging onto stocks even after they\u2019ve increased by many multiples if he thought there was still significant upside potential. The takeaway: avoid clinging to arbitrary rules and consider a stock on its own merits. There is no guarantee that a stock will rebound after a protracted decline, and it\u2019s important to be realistic about the prospect of poorly performing investments. And even though acknowledging losing stocks can psychologically signal failure, there is no shame in recognizing mistakes and selling off investments to stem further loss. In both scenarios, it\u2019s critical to judge companies on their merits to determine whether a price justifies future potential. Read about Investopedia's 10 Rules of Investing by picking up a copy of our special issue print edition. Regardless of the source, never accept a stock tip as valid. Always do your own analysis of a company before investing your hard-earned money. Tips do sometimes pan out, depending upon the reliability of the source, but long-term success demands deep-dive research. Rather than panic over an investment\u2019s short-term movements, it\u2019s better to track its big-picture trajectory. Have confidence in an investment\u2019s larger story, and don\u2019t be swayed by short-term volatility. Don't overemphasize the few cents difference you might save from using a\u00a0limit\u00a0versus\u00a0market order. Sure, active traders use minute-to-minute fluctuations to lock in gains but long-term investors succeed based on periods lasting 20 years or more. Investors often place great importance on price-earnings ratios, but placing too much emphasis on a single metric is ill-advised. P/E ratios are best used in conjunction with other analytical processes. Therefore, a low P/E ratio doesn't necessarily mean a security is\u00a0undervalued, nor does a high P/E ratio necessarily mean a company is\u00a0overvalued. Some mistakenly believe there\u2019s less to lose with low-priced stocks. But whether a $5 stock plunges to $0 or a $75 stock does the same, you've lost 100% of your initial investment, so both stocks carry similar downside risks. In fact, penny stocks are likely riskier than higher-priced stocks because they tend to be less regulated and often see much more volatility. There are many ways to pick stocks, and it\u2019s important to stick with a single philosophy. Vacillating between different approaches effectively makes you a\u00a0market timer, which is dangerous territory. Consider how noted investor Warren Buffett stuck to his value-oriented strategy and steered clear of the dotcom boom of the late '90s\u2014consequently avoiding major losses when tech startups crashed. Investing requires making informed decisions based on things that have yet to happen. Past data can indicate things to come, but it\u2019s never guaranteed. In his 1989 book \"One Up on\u00a0Wall Street\" Peter Lynch stated: \"If I'd bothered to ask myself, 'How can this stock possibly go higher?' I would never have bought Subaru after it had already gone up twentyfold. But I checked the\u00a0fundamentals, realized that Subaru was still cheap, bought the stock, and made sevenfold after that.\" It\u2019s important to invest based on future potential versus past performance. It's best to avoid the \"get in, get out\" mentality of quickly trying to profit from trades. If you've done your research and found a solid stock that continues to be a good investment, holding onto it for the long term should bring profits. While large short-term profits can often entice market neophytes, long-term investing is essential to greater success. And while short-term active trading can make money, this involves greater risk than\u00a0buy-and-hold\u00a0strategies. Many great companies are household names, but many good investments lack brand awareness. Furthermore, thousands of smaller companies have the potential to become the blue-chip names of\u00a0tomorrow. This is not to suggest that you should devote your entire portfolio to small-cap stocks, but there are many great companies beyond those in the\u00a0Dow Jones Industrial Average\u00a0(DJIA). Putting taxes above all else can cause investors to make misguided decisions. While tax implications are important, they are secondary to investing and securely growing your money. While you should strive to minimize tax liability, achieving high returns is the primary goal. Long-term investing is generally considered to be three years or more. Holding onto an asset, such as stocks or real estate for more than three years is considered long-term. When individuals sell assets at a profit, capital gains taxes are charged for investments held for longer than one year. Investments held for less than a year are charged taxes at an investor's ordinary income, which is not as favorable as the capital gains tax rate. No investment is 100% safe but some are safer than others, and of those, some have higher returns. Such assets include certificates of deposit, high-yield savings accounts, Series I savings bonds, Treasury Bills, and money market funds. The primary con of long-term investing is its opportunity cost. Funds that are tied up in long-term investments cannot be used for other investments, particularly short-term profitable opportunities. This may not be an issue in the future if the long-term investments bring in enough profit. Investing in stocks never guarantees profits and can be challenging due to the constant fluctuation of the markets, movements in the economy, policy changes, world events, and more. Even with a lot of research, it can be hard to pick a winner or know when a winner becomes a loser and vice versa. Heeding to the above 10 tips can help make you a better investor and hopefully bring in some profits. Peter Lynch via Google Books. \"One Up on Wall Street,\" Pages 32-33. Simon & Schuster, 2000.

            "title": "Are You Investing or Gambling?",
            "content": "Gambling is defined as staking something on a contingency \u2014 wagering money on something that has an uncertain and potentially negative outcome. However, when trading is considered, gambling takes on a much more complex dynamic than the definition presents. Many traders are gambling without even knowing it \u2014 trading in a way, or for a reason that is completely dichotomous with success in the markets. In this article, we will look at the hidden ways in which gambling creeps into trading practices, as well as the stimulus that may drive an individual to trade (and possibly gamble) in the first place. It is quite likely that anyone who believes they don't have gambling tendencies will not happily admit to having them if it turns out they are in fact acting on gambling impulses. Yet discovering the underlying motives behind our actions can help us change the way we make decisions in the future. Before delving into gambling tendencies when actually trading, one tendency is apparent in many people before trading even takes place. This same motivator continues to impact traders as they gain experience and become regular market participants. Some people may not even have an interest in trading or investing in the financial markets, but social pressure induces them to trade or invest anyway. This is especially common when large numbers of people are talking about investing in the markets (often during the final phase of a bull market). People feel pressure to fall in line with their social circle. Thus\u00a0they invest so as not to disrespect or disregard others' beliefs or feel left out. Making some trades to appease social forces is not gambling in and of itself if people actually know what they are doing. However, entering into a financial transaction without a solid investment understanding is gambling.\u00a0Such people lack the knowledge to exert control over the profitability of their choices. There are many variables in the market, and misinformation among investors or traders creates a gambling scenario. Until knowledge has been developed that allows people to overcome the odds of losing, gambling is taking place with each transaction that occurs. If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, call the National Council on Problem Gambling Helpline at 1-800-522-4700, or visit NCPGambling.org/Chat to chat with a helpline specialist. Once someone is involved in the financial markets, there is a learning curve, which based on the social proofing discussion above may seem like it is gambling. This may or may not be true based on the individual. How the person approaches the market will determine whether they become a successful trader or remain a perpetual gambler in the financial markets. The following two traits (among many) are easily overlooked but contribute to gambling tendencies in traders. Even a losing trade can stir emotions and a sense of power or satisfaction, especially when related to social proofing. If everyone in a person's social circle is losing money in the markets, losing money on a trade will allow that person to enter the conversation with\u00a0their own\u00a0story. When a person trades for excitement or social proofing reasons, it is likely they are\u00a0trading in a gambling style, rather than in a methodical and tested way. Trading the markets is exciting\u2014it links the person into a global network of traders and investors with different ideas, backgrounds, and beliefs. Yet getting caught up in the \"idea\" of trading, the excitement, or emotional highs and lows, is likely to detract from acting in a systematic and methodical way. Speculation involves making a risky investment, but one with a positive\u00a0expected return. The expected return for gambling is always negative for the player, even though some may get lucky and win in the short run. Trading in a methodical and systematic way is important in any odds-based scenario. Trading to win seems like the most obvious reason to trade. After all, why trade if you can't win? But there is a hidden detrimental flaw when it comes to this belief and trading. While making money is the desired overall result, trading to win can actually drive us further away from making money. If winning is our prime motivator, the following scenario is likely to play out: Taylor buys a stock they feel is oversold. The stock continues to fall, placing Taylor in a negative position. Instead of realizing the stock is not simply oversold and something else must be going on, Taylor continues to hold, hoping the stock will come back so they can win (or at least\u00a0break even) on the trade. The focus on winning has forced the trader into the position where they don't get out of bad positions, because to do so would be to admit they lost. Good traders take many losses\u2014they admit they are wrong and keep the damage small. Not having to win on every trade and taking losses when conditions indicate they should is what allows them to be profitable over many trades. Holding losing positions after original entry conditions have changed or turned negative means the trader is now gambling and no longer using sound trading methods (if they ever were). Investing is the act of committing capital to an asset like a stock, with the expectation of generating income or profit. Gambling, on the other hand, is wagering money on an uncertain outcome, that statistically is likely to be negative. A gambler owns nothing, while an investor owns a share of the underlying company. Statistically, gambling is not a smart way to make money. The odds are against the gambler, with the house having a built-in mathematical advantage that grows over time. While it is possible to win a big payout, or to mitigate risk through selective playing based on research and odds, overall, most gamblers will end up losing money. While both involve minimizing risk to reap rewards, an investor's odds are generally better than that of a gambler. That's because with gambling, the house has an edge, a statistical advantage over the gambler that grows the longer the person is playing. A gambler can still strike it big, but it's more likely the person will ultimately lose. Investing can yield great losses, but the stock market generally appreciates over time, and if you keep investing, the odds are generally in your favor, certainly more so than for a gambler. Gambling tendencies run far deeper than most people initially perceive and well beyond the standard definitions. Gambling can take the form of needing to socially prove one's self, or acting in a way to be socially accepted, which results in taking action in a field one knows little about. Gambling in the markets is often evident in people who do it mostly for the emotional high they receive from the excitement and action of the markets. Finally, relying on emotion or a must-win attitude to create profits\u2014rather than trading in a methodical and tested system\u2014indicates the person is gambling in the markets and unlikely to succeed over the course of many trades.

Amanda Bellucco-Chatham is an editor, writer, and fact-checker with years of experience researching personal finance topics. Specialties include general financial planning, career development, lending, retirement, tax preparation, and credit. Investment bankers are financial professionals who advise corporations, as well as governments or\u00a0other entities. They help these clients\u00a0raise capital (money) by issuing shares of stock or offering bonds. Investment bankers also can assist clients with financial transactions such acquisitions, mergers, and even the sale of the company. Investopedia / Jake Shi Investment bankers facilitate large, complicated financial transactions. These transactions may include structuring an acquisition, merger, or sale for clients. Another responsibility of investment bankers is issuing securities as a means of raising capital. This involves creating detailed documentation for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) necessary for a company to go public. An investment banker can save a client time and money by identifying the risks associated with a particular project before a company moves forward. In theory, the investment banker is an expert in their field or industry, who has a finger on the pulse of the current investing climate. Businesses and nonprofit institutions often turn to investment bankers for advice on how best to plan their development. An investment banker also assists with pricing financial instruments and navigating\u00a0regulatory requirements. When a company holds its initial public offering (IPO), an investment bank will buy all or much of that company\u2019s shares directly, acting as an intermediary. In this case, acting on behalf of the company going public, the investment bank will subsequently sell the company\u2019s shares into the public market, creating immediate liquidity. An investment bank stands to make a profit in this scenario, generally pricing its shares at a markup. While experienced analysts at the investment bank use their expertise to price the stock accurately, an investment banker can lose money on the deal if they have overvalued the shares. Investment bankers and their firms take on a high level of risk during an IPO. They must have a strong sense of the market and the industry in which their clients are positioned to decide whether the risk is worth the potential profit. When a company works with an investment banker for the IPO, the investment banker's firm buys the shares from the client at an agreed-upon price, based on how the firm's analysts value the company and how much they expect shares of the stock to be worth. Then, on the day of the IPO, the firm sells those shares to the public at a higher price than it paid to make a profit. As an example, suppose that Pete\u2019s Paints Co. wants to go public. Pete, the owner, gets in touch with Catherine, a prominent investment banker. Pete and Catherine strike a deal in which Catherine (on behalf of her firm) agrees to buy 100,000 shares of Pete\u2019s Paints for the company\u2019s IPO at the price of $24 per share, based on her analyst team's recommendations. The investment bank pays $2.4 million for the 100,000 shares. After filing the appropriate paperwork, such as SEC Form S-1, and setting the IPO's date and time, Catherine and her team offer the stock into the open market at $26 per share. If the market supports the $26 per share price, Catherine's firm would make $2.6 million from the IPO, for a profit of $200,000. However, if public demand is weak, the firm might not be able to sell all the shares at this price. Catherine and her team would be forced to reduce the price to sell the rest of the holdings. In this case, the firm could incur a loss on the sale, but Pete's Paints Co. would still receive $2.4 million. The investment banking field is popular because investment bankers are typically well paid. However, these positions require specific skills, such as: Investment bankers must abide by their firm's stipulated code of conduct and ethics. Because of the sensitive nature of the information they receive, they must typically sign a confidentiality agreement for each client. Moreover, there is potential for conflict of interest if the advisory and trading divisions of investment banks interact. A hierarchy of positions typically exists in investment banking. These positions usually go from analyst (from junior to senior), associate, vice president, senior vice president, and then managing director. Educational requirements for investment bankers usually include an MBA from a top-notch institution, and some may have an advanced degree in mathematics. They may also need the chartered financial analyst (CFA) designation, which is offered by the CFA institute. An investment banking analyst, which is the lowest level of investment banker, can expect an average annual pay of $137,000 to $235,000 in 2024. More experienced investment bankers can earn much higher salaries, depending on their firm and clients. Many investment bankers receive bonuses, tips, or profit-sharing as part of their pay. Investment bankers often work as part of a financial institution. Examples of investment banker employers are Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC), and Deutsche Bank (DB). Investment bankers are financial advisors who work with corporations, governments, and other large entities. They assist clients with raising capital, often through stock offerings or floating a bond issue. They can also assist with major financial transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, or the sale of a company. Investment bankers usually have an MBA or an advanced degree in mathematics, usually from a highly-ranked university. They work for a financial institution\u00a0and are highly compensated, with annual salaries (plus bonuses) that are typically worth six figures.

            "title": "Short-Term Investments: Definition, How They Work, and Examples",
            "content": "Short-term investments, also known as marketable securities or temporary investments, are financial investments that can easily be converted to cash, typically within five years. Many short-term investments are sold or converted to cash after a period of only three-12 months. Some common examples of short-term investments include CDs, money market accounts, high-yield savings accounts, government bonds, and Treasury bills. Usually, these investments are high-quality and highly liquid assets or investment vehicles. Short-term investments may also refer specifically to financial assets\u2014of a similar kind, but with a few additional requirements\u2014that are owned by a company. Recorded in a separate account, and listed in the current assets section of the corporate balance sheet, short-term investments in this context are investments that a company has made that are expected to be converted into cash within one year. Short-term investments can be contrasted with long-term investments. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol The goal of a short-term investment\u2014for both companies and individual or institutional investors\u2014is to protect capital while also generating a return similar to a Treasury bill index fund or another similar benchmark. Companies in a strong cash position will have a short-term investments account on their balance sheet. As a result, the company can afford to invest excess cash in stocks, bonds, or cash equivalents to earn higher interest than what would be earned from a normal savings account. There are two basic requirements for a company to classify an investment as short-term. First, it must be liquid, like a stock listed on a major exchange that trades frequently or U.S. Treasury bonds. Second, the management must intend to sell the security within a relatively short period, such as 12 months. Marketable debt securities, aka \"short-term paper,\" that mature within a year or less, such as U.S. Treasury bills and commercial paper, also count as short-term investments. Marketable equity securities include investments in common and preferred stock. Marketable debt securities can include corporate bonds\u2014that is, bonds issued by another company\u2014but they also need to have short maturity dates and should be actively traded to be considered liquid. Unlike long-term investments, which are designed to be bought and held for a period of at least a year, short-term investments are bought knowing they will be quickly sold. Typically, long-term investors are willing to accept a higher level of volatility or risk, with the idea that these \"bumps\" will eventually smooth out over a long period\u2014as long as, of course, the investment is growing in a positive trajectory Long-term investments are also used by individuals that are able to stow away their money and don't have immediate needs for it (such as to buy a car or a house). Short-term investments help ground an investor's portfolio. Although they typically offer lower rates of return compared to investing in an index fund over time, they are highly liquid investments that give investors the flexibility of making money they can withdraw quickly, if needed. For a business, long-term investments are not counted as income until they are sold. This means that companies that decide to hold or invest in short-term investments count any fluctuations in price at the market rate. This means short-term investments that decline in value are marked down as a loss for the company on\u00a0the income statement. Short-term investment gains are reflected directly on the income statement. Short-term investments take on lower risk, making them stable options. Short-term investments help diversify income types, in case of market volatility. Short-term investments typically have lower rates of return. Any declines in value of a short-term investment will directly affect the net income of a business. Some common short-term investments and strategies used by corporations and individual investors include: If you have excess cash, using it to pay off higher-interest debt may be more advantageous than investing it in low-risk but low-return short-term investments. On its quarterly statement dated Apr. 21, 2022, Microsoft Corp. reported holding $92.2 billion of short-term investments on its balance sheet. The biggest component was U.S. government securities, which was $78.4 billion. This was followed by corporate notes/bonds worth $11.7 billion, mortgage/asset-backed securities at $590 million, foreign government bonds worth $501 million, municipal securities at $269 million, and certificates of deposit (CDs) at $2 billion. Some of the best short-term investment options include short-dated CDs, money market accounts, high-yield savings accounts, government bonds, and Treasury bills. Check their current interest rates or rates of return to discover which is best for you. Common short-term investment vehicles include six-month CDs, money market accounts, high-yield savings accounts, government bonds, and Treasury bills. Based on experience and risk tolerance, investors will differ on this question. However, many financial analysts will say the best way to invest $5,000 is to put it in a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 and keep it for the long run. Individuals with only a little bit of cash have a lot of options. They can put the money in any investments that don't require a minimum balance, such as certain savings accounts, fractional shares of an index fund, or even cheaper stocks, bonds, and CDs. Short-term investments can be great investments for individual investors and corporations who are looking for both liquid and stable options to grow their wealth. The options are plenty: from CDs to bonds and high-yield savings accounts, it's only up to each investor to do their homework.

            "title": "How To Be a Conservative Investor",
            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications. Mention conservative investing, and people think of putting money away in the biggest, most stable and risk-averse enterprises and assets, which in turn guarantees safety of principal (if the invested capital happens to also appreciate in value, that's even better). While it's true that some industries (such as utilities) are defined as conservative, simply buying the large, well-known companies does not fulfill the goal of a successful conservative investment approach. Instead, such a viewpoint increases the confusion between acting conservatively and behaving conventionally. Conservative investing, when understood and applied properly, is not a low-risk, low-return strategy. Investors must understand two definitions to appreciate the appropriate means by which to invest conservatively. Where many investors falter in attempting to invest conservatively is blindly assuming that, by purchasing any security that qualifies as a conservative investment, they are in fact conservative investors. In other words, such investors simply focus on the first definition. Such a viewpoint is limited and costly. A successful conservative investment approach requires not only an understanding of what a conservative investment is, but\u2014more importantly\u2014the correct approach to take in order to identify what truly qualifies as a conservative investment. If, based on the first definition, investors already know what qualifies as a conservative investment, they needs to know which characteristics define a conservative investment, which is where the second definition comes into play. There are three broad categories which investors can use to identify a conservative investment. Even when a company satisfies the obvious conditions of being a conservative investment, you should always remember to consider this third condition. Great examples of those businesses that pass the test include names such as Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). These companies have demonstrated time and time again the strengths of their franchises. Even more importantly, these companies will likely continue to have very favorable future prospects. Coke essentially competes with Pepsi and no one else. What's more, it's unlikely that entrepreneurs are sitting in garages thinking about creating the next great soft drink company. The existence and continued success of Walmart should raise a red flag for most other retailers, save for Target. Remember Circuit City, which used to be number two in electronics stores? It's now bankrupt, in no small part due to Walmart. Of course, once a passing company has been identified, the stock price only matters in determining the value gained. Investing conservatively is not about simply identifying large, well-known businesses, but also going through a process that identifies why a particular company qualifies as a conservative investment. And as you can see from the names of conservative investment companies above, being a conservative investor can lead to some of the most dependable and respectable returns in the market."

            "title": "6 Investment Styles: Which Fits You?",
            "content": "Do you know what your investment style is? If you're like most investors, you probably haven't given it much thought. Yet, gaining a basic understanding of the major investment styles is one of the fastest ways to make sense out of the thousands of investments available in the market today. The major investment styles can be broken down into three dimensions: active vs. passive management, growth vs. value investing, and small cap vs. large cap companies. Walking through each one and assessing your preferences will give you a quick idea of what investment styles fit your personality. In determining investment style, an investor should first consider the degree to which they believe that financial experts can create greater than normal returns. Investors who want to have professional money managers carefully select their holdings will be interested in active management. Actively managed funds typically have a full time staff of financial researchers and portfolio managers who are constantly seeking to gain larger returns for investors. Since investors must pay for the expertise of this staff, actively managed funds typically charge higher expenses than passively managed funds. Some investors doubt the abilities of active managers in their quest for outsized returns. This position rest primarily on empirical research shows that, over the long run, many passive funds earn better returns for their investors than do similar actively managed funds. Passively managed funds have a built-in advantage\u2014since they do not require researchers, fund expenses are often very low. The next question investors must consider is whether they prefer to invest in fast-growing firms or underpriced industry leaders. To determine which category a company belongs to, analysts look at a set of financial metrics and use judgment to determine which label fits best. The growth style of investing looks for firms that have high earnings growth rates, high return on equity, high profit margins and low dividend yields. The idea is that if a firm has all of these characteristics, it is often an innovator in its field and making lots of money. It is thus growing very quickly, and reinvesting most or all of its earnings to fuel continued growth in the future. The value style of investing is focused on buying a strong firm at a good price. Thus, analysts look for a low price to earnings ratio, low price to sales ratio, and generally a higher dividend yield. The main ratios for the value style show how this style is very concerned about the price at which investors buy in. The final question for investors relates to their preference for investing in either small or large companies. The measurement of a company's size is called \"market capitalization\" or \"cap\" for short. Market capitalization is the number of shares of stock a company has outstanding, multiplied by the share price. Some investors feel that small cap companies should be able to deliver better returns because they have greater opportunities for growth and are more agile. However, the potential for greater returns in small caps comes with greater risk. Among other things, smaller firms have fewer resources and often have less diversified business lines. Share prices can vary much more widely, causing large gains or large losses. Thus, investors must be comfortable with taking on this additional level of risk if they want to tap into a potential for greater returns. More risk averse investors may find greater comfort in more dependable large cap stocks. Amongst the names of large caps, you will find many common names, such as GE, Microsoft, and Exxon Mobil. These firms have been around for a while, and have become the 500 pound gorillas in their industries. These companies may be unable to grow as quickly, since they are already so large. However, they also aren't likely to go out of business without warning. From large caps, investors can expect slightly lower returns than with small caps, but less risk, as well. Investors should think carefully about where they stand on each of these three dimensions of investment style. Clearly defining the investment style that fits you will help you select investments that you will feel comfortable holding for the long term.

Considering his wealth of experience and his professional\u2019s understanding of the investment world, the cost for his course is quite reasonable.

Coursera There is no shortage of cryptocurrency education, but there aren\u2019t many courses that approach the topic with unbiased academic rigor the way this course does. This course also delivers it in an easy-to-consume fashion through the Coursera platform, which students praise. Very practical evaluation of cryptocurrency Instructors who take a serious approach but remain curious instead of arrogant Wide variety of learning aids Certificate of completion Potentially complex for a casual crypto investor or trader Quizzes can get a bit heavy Evergreen content limits discussion on new or emerging altcoins It\u2019s important to understand the evolving crypto universe as more than just an extension of Bitcoin. At the same time, it is important to be able to evaluate Bitcoin alone as an asset. This course covers both of those learning objectives, leaving enough flexibility for students to shift their emphasis based on personal interest. The course is not burdensome to complete. Students can hurry through it in about four hours, but there are over 15 hours of material for those who want to take a deeper dive.

It is the only course we found that includes one-on-one instruction in its teaching approach. In-depth courses, tailored for kids, that can start from zero Highly customized lesson plan Simulated stock market One-on-one instruction Project-based curriculum, focused on desired outcomes Course takes six months Requires focused attention from child Costly The course is an amazing concept with a stratospheric goal: Tailor individual learning for motivated children between the ages of 9 and 18 and get them to learn and perform meaningful simulated investments within six months. Access to the course comes with individual coaching and a stock market simulator. It comes at a cost of $275 a month ($1,650 for six months) and requires a reasonable time commitment from the child. The course cost is not trivial and students must be dedicated. But if a child is interested in learning and mastering investment topics at a young age, there could hardly be a better approach. Most parents would likely agree that the value of acquiring such skills at a young age surpasses the price of the course. The course materials are very good, and they scored a 4.4 on our quality scale. This is a standout program for standout students. Investopedia collected 13 criteria that are critical to investors, from 18 online investing courses. We used this data to review each platform for course structure, costs, available amenities, and other key features to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decision for their investing needs. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best online investing courses since 2020. Investing courses certainly do not have the same value for all investors. Just as investors have different goals and investing styles, online learners have a variety of objectives. That\u2019s why it is important for someone who wants a good investing education to clearly define their investment goals. Whether it is preparing for a career, saving for retirement, attaining a particular net worth, or building a legacy for future generations, the education you need is characterized by the primary goal you have. When selecting which courses are best for you, consider what you want the material to accomplish. You should also consider what it is worth to you in money and time so that you can make selections that fit with the resources available to you. All of the education in this review is tailored to various investing styles, primarily with the goal of building career knowledge and skills or planning for retirement. None of these courses feature education on short-term trading\u2014which is different from long-term investing. It is useful for you to distinguish what topics of investing you want help on in your education. It makes a difference whether you want to know about value investing, growth investing, momentum investing, or something else. What assets you want to trade also makes a difference: Do you want to invest in stocks, options, futures, forex, or cryptocurrency? Online courses can be divided into two groups: those that seek to inform you and those courses that also help you gain experience through practice. Courses that are strictly lecture-oriented are great for delivering information you don\u2019t have and maybe didn\u2019t know to ask about. If that\u2019s all you need, this kind of course fits perfectly. By contrast, courses that allow for simulated environments encourage students to try the things they are learning. These are courses specifically designed to help build skills. That\u2019s where defining your goals comes into play. Consider the following list of course types, and see which kind meets your goals. Depending on what kind of courses you need to fit your goals (information-based courses or skill-building courses) you can begin to select them based on additional criteria such as the following: This industry is rife with scams. Organizations developing material to market coursework designed to help people acquire great wealth rapidly should naturally be met with skepticism. The telltale sign of a scam appears when the information you are reading appears to be designed to stir emotions in the reader, more than it seeks to inform the reader. Scams are built to sell people based on strong emotion, not boring facts. If you are suspicious that what you are evaluating might be a scam, notice whether the description includes the following elements. Worthwhile investing courses should give you the ability to either be well-informed or moderately skilled by the time you complete the course. Here are additional characteristics to look for: Courses that don\u2019t assume previous knowledge, keep their information at a basic level, and have practice tools are usually the best-designed courses for beginners. Comprehensive courses with a large amount of content are usually not best for beginners. A beginner needs to become familiar with basic concepts before they can take on a large collection of information. Among all possible topics, the three key topics a good investing course should cover include how to: Once you have determined your educational needs, it becomes simpler to define your clear action goals and start making practice trades. Beginners should prepare to learn about modern portfolio theory and learn how to construct a portfolio, but then they should practice doing so. This activity takes at least three months to complete. Beginners should complete this, or a similar activity, before risking any money in the marketplace.

Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. CBS Photo Archive\u00a0/\u00a0Getty Images \"Billions,\" the hit series from CBS's Showtime network, ran for seven seasons before the series finale aired in October 2023. The show, which debuted in 2016 as the brainchild of veteran TV writers Bryan Koppelman and David Levien, takes us deep into the opulent and cutthroat world of hedge funds, white-collar criminals, and prosecutors willing to cross the line to catch a whale. The series follows billionaire hedge fund king Bobby Axelrod (Damian Lewis from the hit \"Homeland\"), the show\u2019s main protagonist, and founder of Axe Capital, on his endless pursuit of an edge to tilt the capital markets in his favor. For the first three seasons, Axe, as he is called, is relentlessly pursued by U.S. Attorney Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti, of \"Sideways\" and \"John Adams\" fame). Rhoades' wife, Dr. Wendy Rhoades (Maggie Siff) just happens to be Axe Capital's in-house psychologist, which, to say the least, complicates matters. \"Billions\" exposes viewers to the genius and, as\u00a0some would have it, dirty tricks, of hedge fund managers who weave their portfolio trading strategies around financial regulators, insider trading,\u00a0corporate actions, and more. It also tracks the relentless pursuit of these hedge fund titans by U.S. attorneys, who sometimes bend the law themselves in order to gain an edge and\u00a0win their cases. The show is laden with investing and financial terminology, which makes it irresistible for us. It offers a fascinating look into the way financial markets work at the extremes, and how the system is played by its richest participants.

            "title": "What Is Wall Street? Role in Investing and Why It's Famous",
            "content": "Wall Street is literally a street located in New York City at the southern end of Manhattan. Figuratively, Wall Street is much more. It's synonymous with the financial industry and the firms within it. This connotation has its roots in the fact that so many brokerages and investment banks historically have established their headquarters in and around the street. All the better to be close to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Being on or near Wall Street is no longer considered essential for financial institutions. In fact, these days they are located all around the country. However, the term \"Wall Street\" still means business\u2014the investment business\u2014and the interests, motivations, and attitudes of its players. Wall Street and its surrounding southern Manhattan neighborhood\u2014known to locals as the Financial District\u2014remain an important location where a number of financial institutions are based. The financial district is iconic with the bronze Arturo Di Modica statue of the Charging Bull. However, the globalization and digitization of finance and investing have led to the rise of many U.S. broker-dealers, registered investment advisors, and investment companies located elsewhere. Still, Wall Street remains a collective name for the financial markets, the companies that trade publicly, and the investment community itself. Stock exchanges, investment banking firms, commercial banks, brokerages and broker-dealers, financial services, and underwriting firms all symbolize Wall Street. It's a globally recognized expression that, to some extent, ever refers to the U.S. financial system. Both the NYSE (the largest equities-based exchange in the world) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2014arguably the most important regional bank of the Federal Reserve System\u2014are based in the Wall Street area. Wall Street is often shortened to \"the Street,\" which is how the term is frequently used by those in financial circles and the media. For example, when reporting a company's earnings, an analyst might compare a company's revenues to what the Street was expecting. In this case, the analyst is comparing the company's earnings to what financial analysts and investment firms were expecting for that period. Wall Street has had an important impact both economically and culturally. The U.S. is the largest economy in the world and New York City is its financial center. As such, Wall Street's global importance is unparalleled. Wall Street consists of some of the largest financial institutions in the world and employs hundreds of thousands of people. It's home to the NYSE and Nasdaq stock exchanges, two of the largest stock exchanges in the world. On these exchanges are listed some of the biggest companies, including Amazon, Google, Apple, and Exxon. The economic importance of Wall Street extends throughout the American and international economies, as many financial firms do business worldwide, extend loans to a variety of businesses and individuals, and finance large-scale, global projects. Wall Street's cultural influence extends to movies, TV shows, books, and more. Films such as Wall Street, Margin Call, Boiler Room, Barbarians at the Gate, and more from previous decades, highlight what the fast-paced life is like on Wall Street. They display an exciting, wealthy, and interesting lifestyle. Large players on Wall Street have become celebrity icons. Warren Buffett, Jamie Dimon, Carl Icahn, Bernie Madoff, George Soros, and Larry Fink are names familiar to many. In the imaginations of some in contemporary society, the term Wall Street may evoke a sense of power, the elite, and often, unscrupulous behavior. During times of economic trouble, such as the financial crisis of 2008, Wall Street sometimes becomes a scapegoat and the ills of the economy are blamed on the assumed greed associated with it. No other financial term has become so woven into the global culture. Wall Street got its name from the wooden wall Dutch colonists built in lower Manhattan in 1653 to defend themselves from the British and Native Americans. The wall was taken down in 1699, but the name stuck. Given its proximity to New York's ports, the Wall Street area became a bustling center of trade in the 1700s. Its origins as a financial center began in\u00a01792, when 24 of the most prominent\u00a0brokers\u00a0and merchants in the U.S. signed the\u00a0Buttonwood\u00a0Agreement. They reportedly gathered on Wall Street, under a buttonwood tree, to do business. The agreement outlined the common\u00a0commission-based form of trading securities. In effect, it was an effort to establish a members-only stock exchange. Some of the first securities traded were war bonds and\u00a0the stocks of such institutions as the Bank of New York. Out of this acorn of an agreement, the oak that became the NYSE grew. In 1817, the Buttonwood brokers renamed themselves The New York Stock and Exchange Board. The organization rented out spaces for trading in several locations until 1865, when it settled on a location of its own, at the corner of Wall and Broad Streets. The location of the beating heart of Wall Street, the NYSE, is a 1903 Neo-Classical structure of white marble. An adjacent annex, constructed in 1922, is located at 11 Wall Street, and another subsidiary building is at 20 Broad Street. These three buildings fill the block bounded by Wall Street on the north, Broad Street on the East, Exchange Place on the south, and New Street on the west. As the U.S. grew, several other major exchanges established headquarters in the Wall Street area. These included the\u00a0New York Mercantile Exchange, the\u00a0New York Board of Trade, the New York Futures Exchange (NYFE), and the\u00a0American Stock Exchange, now known as the NYSE American Options. To support the exchanges and to be where the action was, banks, brokerage firms, and financiers clustered offices around Wall Street. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the House of Morgan, officially J.P. Morgan & Co.\u2014the forerunner to JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley\u2014was directly opposite the NYSE, at 23 Wall Street. After World War I, New York City surpassed London to become the world's largest and most significant financial center. Wall Street is often compared and contrasted to Main Street. The term \"Main Street\" is used as a metaphor for individual investors, small businesses, employees, and the overall economy. It's derived from the common name for the principal street of a town where most of the local businesses are located. There is often a perceived conflict between the goals, desires, and motivations of Main Street and Wall Street. Wall Street tends to represent big businesses and financial institutions, while Main Street represents mom-and-pop shops, small companies, and individuals. Events that happened on or around Wall Street often have impacted not just the investment industry, but the global economy and society. Here are some significant moments in Wall Street history. On July 8, 1889, Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser\u00a0launched The Wall Street Journal, a four-page afternoon newspaper devoted to objective financial and business news. The three men were reporters, but Dow was also a numbers-cruncher who came up with the idea of creating a benchmark list of companies and their stock prices to represent the entire stock market. Soon, the Journal was publishing the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index along with hundreds of prices of company stocks, bonds, and futures, and the average prime rate for bank loans. For nearly a century, before the advent of real-time internet listings, the Journal was the paper of record for the financial markets. It evolved into a six-day-a-week periodical (that's been online since 1996). The Journal is a leading and well-respected source of financial and business journalism. The three founders operated out of offices in lower Manhattan. The fact that they chose to name their new publication The Wall Street Journal indicates that Wall Street already was something of an umbrella term for the world of finance and its denizens. Over the years, the paper helped fix this meaning in the public's mind. It was around noon on Sept. 16, 1920. A horse-drawn cart pulled up at 23 Wall Street right in front of the headquarters of J.P. Morgan & Co. A bustling corner of the neighborhood, it was especially crowded with those headed out for lunch. The cart suddenly exploded. It had been packed with dynamite and filled with sash weights that sailed through the air. At that time, it was the worst domestic bombing in U.S. history. Ultimately, 40 people were killed or died from their injuries, and another 300 were injured. The J.P. Morgan building's interior was gutted. Marks from the shrapnel still are visible on the exterior. No one claimed credit and the case was never solved. But because the explosion occurred in front of the Morgan building, known as a symbol of American capitalism, the bombing was ultimately decided to have been an act of terrorism performed by \u201cReds\u201d\u2014anarchists and communist sympathizers. A stack of anarchist flyers found in a mailbox a block away from Wall Street supported this theory. As a result, the authorities arrested hundreds of suspected Reds and deported those of foreign nationality. The bombing also encouraged the nativist sentiments that developed in the U.S. during the 1920s, which led to tighter restrictions on immigration. The stock market crash of 1929 remains the worst financial crisis in U.S. history. In a pre-digital trading era, its epicenter was the NYSE. The crash began on October 24 when, after nearly a decade of unparalleled, uninterrupted growth, the stock market opened lower than the previous session. Equities' prices continued to drop throughout the day and, as the news spread, crowds began to gather outside the Exchange. They groaned as the market closed down again that day, cheered brokers during the next two days when the market seemed to rally, and then panicked on October 28 and October 29, when the declines resumed. Inside the stock exchange, the scene was sheer pandemonium as prices fell too fast for ticker tapes and blackboards to record them. Ultimately, the DJIA was to fall 89% from its September 1929 peak, wiping out both corporate and individual wealth. The crash ushered in the\u00a0Great Depression. A quarter of America\u2019s working population lost their jobs as the U.S. economy went into a tailspin. Economies throughout Europe followed suit. In the end, the stock market crash and the ensuing decade-long depression\u00a0directly impacted nearly every segment of society and altered an entire generation's perspective of, and relationship to, the\u00a0financial markets. On what is known as Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 25% in value, leading exchanges around the world to drop in a similar frenzy. The week prior, indices had fallen an approximate 10%, priming the pump for the ensuing panic. Up until that time, a bull market had been in control since 1982. Thanks to the actions of chairman Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve, a seeming disaster on a global scale was averted. But the crash brought to light the potential for disruption that the then-new technique of computer programs instigating large-scale amounts of trading might cause (even though enormous amounts of trading were handled by humans that day, as well). The exact cause of this short-term crash has never been pinpointed. However, afterwards, exchanges implemented circuit breaker rules to prevent program trading from spurring runaway selling. It was hoped that this and other trading curbs would allow the markets time to stabilize and give regulators (and investors) the chance to take appropriate steps. The global financial crisis of 2007-2008 resulted from years of deregulation, easy credit, predatory mortgage lending, the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, and the unregulated use of derivatives. It led to the Great Recession. The root cause of the crisis was unethical and exploitative behavior by banks, investment banks, and insurance firms. Borrowers with unsatisfactory credit were given mortgage loans without concern for their ability to pay them off and without their comprehension of the risks involved with the loans. As rates rose, those borrowers' mortgage rates reset higher and they couldn't afford to make monthly payments. What's more, as home prices fell dramatically, homeowners couldn't sell their houses for enough to cover their loans. This caused massive numbers of defaults. Risky derivative securities had been created with the subprime mortgage loans sold by banks. In addition, banks and other large investors used customer deposits to invest in these derivatives. With the defaults on home loans, the derivatives plunged in value. Many financial institutions had ties to the loans, derivatives, and credit default swaps, an insurance product that investors in the derivatives bought to protect against the risk of default. Thus, they found themselves in severe trouble after the housing market bubble burst. From housing industry crash to a U.S. financial industry on the brink of collapse to the near ruin of other financial systems across the globe. It was the worst financial crisis since the stock market crash of 1929. The U.S. government had no choice but to bail out financial institutions that had always been considered \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d Occupy Wall Street was a 2011 protest\u00a0movement\u00a0against social and economic inequality\u00a0that was centered in\u00a0Zuccotti Park, located in Manhattan's Financial District. It began on September 17, as hundreds of protesters camped out in the park. The police forcibly removed and arrested them two months later, on November 15. During the intervening period, there were marches and speeches, calling for more balanced income distribution, better-paying jobs, bank reform, and less corporate influence in politics.\u00a0\"We are the 99%,\" was the Occupy protestors' slogan. Regulatory measures were put into place to address the lack of government oversight that was considered to have led to the crisis that began in 1929. Among other things, the Securities Act of 1933 required financial institutions to provide investors with all significant information about securities being offered for sale. It also prohibited fraud in securities sales. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and gave it significant power over the securities industry. This included the authority to regulate brokerage firms and to require financial reporting by publicly traded companies. In 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). It created new government agencies with financial system oversight. The idea behind the act was to address the risky behaviors of financial institutions and the dearth of regulatory oversight that led to the crisis. One area of grave concern was the predatory mortgage lending that had occurred. Another focus was the stability of financial institutions. The act made it possible to liquidate or restructure firms, if necessary, to prevent the use of taxpayer funds to keep them afloat. The act's Volker Rule restricted the investing practices of banks and regulated derivative securities. It also set up the SEC Office of Credit Ratings to ensure that credit agencies henceforth issued appropriate ratings for institutions, rather than the fabricated favorable ratings that were part of the lead-up to the crisis. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act signed in 2018 by President Trump addressed criticisms of Dodd-Frank and rolled back some of its provisions. Among other things, it exempted banks with assets of less than $10 billion from the Volker Rule requirements, gave consumers the ability to freeze their credit files at no cost, and eased capital requirements for banks that didn't offer lending or traditional banking services. Speculation refers to the act of investing in securities that have a high risk-reward profile with the goal of obtaining substantial gains, despite the risk of substantial losses. An investor who speculates is likely focused on price fluctuations. They may believe that the market has inaccurately priced a security and they're trying to capitalize on that disparity. Wall Street speculators tend to be professional traders as opposed to retail investors who buy and hold stocks or other assets for the long term. The major U.S. stock markets, including the NYSE and the Nasdaq, are normally open 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday. However, there are also extended-hour sessions earlier and later. Black Wall Street was a nickname given to the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, one of the largest and most prosperous African-American business communities in the U.S. in the early 20th century. From May to June, 1921, its 35 blocks were destroyed during the Tulsa Race Riot. It was quickly rebuilt, with over 80 businesses reopening by 1922. More generally, Black Wall Street can also refer to any area of\u00a0African-American\u00a0high economic or financial activity. Getting a job on Wall Street often starts in college. Majors like finance, business administration and management, economics,\u00a0accounting, and mathematics are natural fits\u00a0for the investment industry. Firms will consider degrees in other areas too, like marketing or engineering. Try to get an internship at a Wall Street firm or similar institution for at least one summer. A\u00a0Master of Business Administration (MBA) can also be attractive to financial institutions, as can tech industry experience. It's also important to target what type of Wall Street job you'd be best suited for. They break down into three main areas: Wall Street is both an actual street and a symbol. It's home to a variety of financial and investment firms, along with institutions like the NYSE and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Globally, it's come to connote the U.S. financial and\u00a0investment communities and industries, plus its interests, attitudes, and behavior.

            "title": "How To Talk Like An Investor",
            "content": "When it comes to understanding the long and short of investing, most beginning\u00a0investors must learn what seems like a new language. In fact, the phrase \"the long and the short of it\" originated in financial markets. In this article we discuss several key terms that will help you better understand and communicate with other market participants. These terms are used in the equities, derivatives, futures, commodities\u00a0and forex (or currency) markets. You will learn what buying, selling, and shorting really mean to investors and how they can use certain terms interchangeably with more confusing words like bullish and bearish. To compound the issue, options traders add in a few other terms such as \"writing a contract\" or \"selling a contract.\" When you start to communicate about the markets more\u00a0comfortably, you will be better informed and can make wise investment decisions. The financial markets allow you to do a few things that are really common in everyday life and a few things that aren't. When you buy a car, you own that car. In the stock market, also known as the equity market, when you buy a stock, you own that stock. You are also said to be \"long\" on the stock or have a long position. Whether you are trading futures, currencies or commodities, if you are long on a position, it means you own it and hope it will increase in value. To close out of a long position, you sell it. Shorting will likely seem somewhat foreign to most new investors, because shorting a position in the equity market is selling stock you don't actually own. Brokerage firms allow speculators to borrow shares of stock and sell them on the open market, with the commitment to eventually return the shares. The investor will then sell the stock at the day's price in the hope of buying it back at a lower price while pocketing the difference. Catalog companies and online retailers use this concept daily by selling a product at a higher price, and then quickly buying it from a supplier at a lower price. The term originates from a situation where a person tries to pay a bill but is \"short\" on funds. You may be interested to know that some people consider shorting to be unpatriotic or \"bad form.\" The phrase \"don't sell America short\" was attributed to John Pierpont Morgan Sr. (J.P. Morgan).\ufeff\ufeff The debate against short selling rages on to this day. When trading foreign currencies in the \"spot\" market (currencies and many commodities are traded in the futures or spot markets), you are usually long one currency and short another. This is because you are exchanging one currency for another and therefore, various world currencies trade in pairs. For instance, if you think the U.S. dollar is going to rise but the euro is going to fall, you could short the euro and be long on the dollar. If you feel the dollar is going to rise and the Japanese yen will fall, you could be long on the dollar and short on the yen. Other terms that are often new to beginning investors are \"bullish\" and \"bearish.\" The term bullish is used to describe a person's feeling that the market will go up, while bearish describes a person who feels the market will go down. The most common way people remember these terms is that a bull attacks by ducking its head and bringing its horns upward. A bear attacks by swiping its paws down. Chicago is the home of commodity and futures markets; coincidentally, the professional basketball team is the Bulls and the professional football team is the Bears. The Chicago Cubs' mascot is a bear cub. It is also common for investors to use the terms \"long\" or \"short\" to describe their market sentiment. Instead of saying they are bullish on the market, investors may say they are long on the market. Similarly on the downside, investors may say they are short on the market instead of using the term bearish. Either term is acceptable when describing your market sentiment. It is important to remember that short and long usually imply that you have a certain position in whatever market you are trading but, as you can see, this isn't always the case. The derivative market is also known as the options market. Options are contracts in which one party agrees to buy or sell a certain security (security is a generic term for any financial product) at a set price and set time from or to another party. Options are very common in the equities market but are also used in the futures and commodities markets. The forex\u00a0(or currency)\u00a0market is known for very creative derivatives known as \"exotic options.\" For our purposes, we'll refer to options in the stock market since it is most investors' first introduction to derivatives. Options come down to calls and puts. Call options give the contract buyer the right to purchase stock shares at a set price on or before a set date. Usually another investor will sell a call contract, which means they believe the stock will stay flat or go down. The person who buys the call is long on the contract, whereas the person who sells the contract is short. A put option allows the contract buyer to sell stock at a set price before a set date. Like a call option, there is usually another investor willing to sell the option contract, which also means that investor believes the stock will either stay about the same price or rise in value. So the person who buys the option contract is long on the contract and the person who sells the contract is short. Selling options while using the derivative dialect also gets more complicated because, not only do they use the terms \"sell\" or \"short\" regarding the contract, option traders will also say they \"wrote\" a contract. Today, the contracts are standardized and no one really \"writes\" the contract, but the term is still very common. Covered calls are often one of the first option strategies investors learn\u2014these involve the purchase of a stock and the sale of a call contract at the same time. The\u00a0purchased stock acts as \"collateral\" in case the call is exercised by the option buyer and the seller can relinquish the shares while keeping the premium gained for selling the option. Since investors are buying a stock and selling a call at the same time, they use a \"buy-write\" order. At this point, you may find yourself going back to reread some of the vocabulary that was just discussed. Let's do a quick recap. Investors will either say they are bullish, or long, on the market\u2014or bearish, or short, on the market. If we are long one currency in the forex spot market, we are short another currency at the same time. This can be confusing but not nearly as confusing as the options market. In the options market, we can say we are bullish on a stock and then short a put because while being bullish, we can either buy a call or sell a put. We can be bearish on a stock and be long on a put because if we are bearish, we can either buy a put or sell a call. This may also mean that we are short on the market by going long on a put or long the on market by shorting a call. You can imagine the linguistic laughter that comes from a group of option buyers talking to each other. In many cases, and not just in the financial world, overcoming the language barrier will be one of the vital keys to success. Investing carries with it its own language barriers that must be broken down by translating the terms and subduing the syntax.

            "title": "4 Tips for Joining an Investment Club",
            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. If you are interested in learning about the stock market and how to take control of your money, it's worth considering joining an investment club. These are groups of people who pool their money to make joint investments, usually in stocks or bonds. Their primary motivation is to make the most money possible, but investment clubs are also a great way to share ideas and learn about the market. But before you join one, there are a few things to consider. Investment clubs have been around for decades as a way for people with modest amounts to invest to partake in larger investments and get first-hand experience and education. They are social groups at heart, with members sharing and debating ideas. An investment club should be set up as a legal partnership or a limited liability company (LLC) consisting of 10 to 20 members. Once it is legally established, standardized accounting records must be established for it. This provides members with the confidence that the money they contribute is not being misused and the record-keeping that will be needed for tax purposes. After an initial lump sum contribution, a member will be required to make a monthly contribution to the pot, usually about $80. Since new members may join and others cash out at any time, the club must have a way to calculate each member's share of the assets at any given point in time. New clubs need to establish a brokerage account in the club's name. Shopping around for a suitable brokerage firm is a good idea, The lower the fees the better it is for the club's membership. An\u00a0investment club needs to hold meetings at least monthly. These meetings can be fun and insightful. Members take turns presenting a stock, fund, or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that they think the club should consider buying. Staying in touch by email or text between meetings keeps the club members involved and informed. Don't buy stocks through an investment club if your time horizon is a year or less. Trying to make money over a shorter period of time is a\u00a0bad approach for beginner investors and for clubs. A short time horizon requires quick buy and sell decisions that investment clubs can't handle. Having a three- to five-year horizon is a better outlook. It's also better for the club, which is not set up for constant membership churn. In fact, most investment clubs specify rules or penalties for early withdrawal from the club. Most specify a liquidation price, or early-withdrawal penalty, which members must pay when withdrawing their funds. Some investment clubs do not pool club members' funds. The members invest their own funds following the club's decisions. Just as individual investors vary greatly in investment style, such as value investing or income stock strategies, so do investment clubs. Every club needs to have a clearly defined investment style, ideally with some quantifiable rules or limitations on the club's investment portfolio. For example, an investment club might specify that members can propose only stocks that have a\u00a0minimum share price or market capitalization. Or, the club might place sector restrictions on portfolio choices to ensure diversification. It is also useful for a new investment club to set standardized criteria for reviewing a stock for potential purchase. That gives club members some experience in equity analysis and provides a rational basis for presentations. Once an investment club has determined its style, every member must be aware of the club's investing style and willing to follow those guidelines. A club can go off the rails if some members want to invest club funds in risky penny stocks while others gravitate towards blue chips. If you are starting the club, make sure every member understands and supports the club's approach. If you join a club, ensure its style meets your needs. If it doesn't, another club probably does. The National Association of Investors Corporation (NAIC), also known as BetterInvesting,\u00a0offers support and information for people wishing to join or start their own investment club in the United States. The NAIC provides excellent tools and publishes a monthly investor-learning magazine. For membership packages, visit the BetterInvesting website here. According to NAIC data, the number of investment clubs registered with the association has seen strong growth in the early 21st century, and about half of all registered clubs have outperformed the S&P 500. That's a level of returns most mutual funds are unable to achieve consistently. In the U.K., ProShare Investment Clubs offers resources such as newsletters, online portfolio tools, a message board for members, and an investment club manual. In Canada, the Investors Association of Canada (IAC) offers in-depth newsletters on personal finance education, discounts on books, and the like. The main goal of an investment club is to make money for its members but education is another good reason to join. Clubs that operate with the goal of educating their members will find that profits naturally follow. The educational aspect is arguably more important. If an investor has no interest in developing investing skills and knowledge, investing in a fund or hiring a full-service broker can provide a reasonable return without the commitments and activities inherent in an investment club. An investment club should also focus on ensuring that all members receive a relatively equal level of educational value from their membership. In fact, it is a good idea to assess a club's level of member expertise before you decide to join. This ensures there is a reasonable match with your own skill level. Also, all club members should participate equally; some members will naturally carry more of a leadership role than others, but if some members do not contribute periodically to the club's meetings, the atmosphere of the entire club is likely to suffer, decreasing the value everyone receives from their membership. It's your choice. Today's investment clubs are often hybrids, forming with a core of like-minded neighbors but meeting virtually for convenience. The non-profit BetterInvesting association has tips for getting set up online. Most investment clubs have eight to 12 members, although a few grow to 20 or more. It's important to keep the club relatively small. It gives everyone a voice and an opportunity to participate. A larger group can spend more time arguing than decision-making. In addition, the larger clubs tend to buy and sell too many stocks too frequently, leading to relatively poor results once trading costs are factored in. Investment clubs that specialize in stocks are the best known and probably the oldest, but there are many others. Real estate investment clubs have been extremely popular in recent years, due to the latest real estate boom. The interest may well have tapered off as interest rates began to chill the housing market in 2022. There also are business investment clubs, also known as incubators. These clubs specialize in investing in promising new business ideas, pooling their cash for greater impact. Investment clubs are a great way to ease into investing. Whether you start your own club or join an existing one, you'll find that being a member of a club is an enlightening experience. One of the valuable benefits of an investment club, especially for beginners, is the exposure to different points of view. Hashing out investing ideas with other individual investors on a regular basis can be an enlightening experience.

            "title": "5 Advantages of Investing in Your 20s",
            "content": "For many young adults, it seems easier to put off any investing decisions until their financial situation becomes, at least theoretically, more stable. Twenty-somethings, however, are actually in a prime position to enter the investing world, even with college debt and low salaries. While money may be tight, young adults do have one thing going for them: time. There is a reason that compounding\u2014the ability to grow an investment by reinvesting the earnings\u2014was referred to by Albert Einstein as \"the eighth wonder of the world.\" The magic of compounding allows investors to generate wealth over time and requires only two things: the reinvestment of earnings and time. A single $10,000 investment at age 20 would grow to over $70,000 by the time the investor was 60 years old (based on a 5% interest rate). That same $10,000 investment made at age 30 would yield about $43,000 by age 60, and made at age 40 would yield only $26,000. The longer money is put to work, the more wealth it can generate. An investor's age influences the amount of risk they can withstand. Young people, with years of earning ahead of them, can afford to take on more risk in their investment activities. While individuals reaching retirement years may gravitate towards low-risk or risk-free investments, such as bonds and certificates of deposit (CDs), young adults can build more aggressive portfolios that are subject to more volatility and stand to produce larger gains. Young investors have the flexibility and time to study investing and learn from their successes and failures. Since investing has a fairly lengthy learning curve, young adults are at an advantage because they have years to study the markets and refine their investing strategies. As with the increased risk that can be absorbed by younger investors, so too can they overcome investing mistakes because they have the time needed to recover. The younger generation is a tech-savvy one, able to study, research, and apply online investing tools and techniques. Online trading platforms provide countless opportunities for both fundamental and technical analysis, as do chat rooms and financial and educational web sites. Technology, including online opportunities, social media, and apps, can all contribute to a young investor's knowledge base, experience, confidence, and expertise. Human capital, from an individual's perspective, can be thought of as the present value of all future wages. Since the ability to earn wages is fundamental to investing and saving for retirement, investing in oneself\u2014by earning a degree, receiving on-the-job training, or learning advanced skills\u2014is a valuable investment that can have strong returns. Young adults often have many opportunities to increase their ability to earn higher future wages, and taking advantage of these opportunities can be considered one of the many forms of investing. Saving for retirement is not the only reason to make well-planned investments. Many investments, such as those made in dividend stocks, can provide an income stream throughout the life of the investment. Twenty-somethings have some definitive advantages over those who wait to begin investing, including time, the ability to weather increased risk, and opportunities to increase future wages. Even if you have to start small, it's in your advantage to start early! U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Stocks.\""

            "content": "Michael Bromberg is a finance editor with a decade of experience. He is an expert at elucidating complex financial topics in clear, concise language. Michael received a Bachelor of Arts in literature from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a master's in linguistics from the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellin, Colombia. Everyone loves money, but not everyone feels great about giving it as a gift. But money as a gift can include a range of ideas, from funds for retirement savings to the means to buy exactly what they'd like for themselves. Invested wisely, money can also increase in value over time. The process of giving money as a gift is generally easy. You can even transfer your gift directly from your account to the recipient's account. Here are a few strategies and tips for how to give money or other financial gifts to your loved one. Money can make a good gift for nearly anyone because it can be used for many purposes, from investing to buying a product. You could give a gift of money for many occasions, such as for birthdays, holiday presents, graduation presents or wedding gifts. Money will allow the recipient to get exactly what they'd like instead of what someone else chooses for them. A gift of money can help a younger person learn about how money works. They could budget the money and learn about saving and spending strategies. Or they could learn lessons in investing. Ultimately, money can be used to help anyone achieve their financial goals, whether, for example, they are saving for a major purchase or building a retirement account. Two main ways to give money are to give it in person or to send it to the recipient online. You could also send money through traditional mail, but this method entails a higher risk that someone may intercept it. Let's look at your options for giving money in more detail. You can give money directly to someone in several forms using a card or envelope or simply handing over the funds. Here are three ways to give money in person: Because you can generally give money directly as simple cash in a card or as a digital asset through a fast and simple online transaction. So money can make a great last-minute gift. If you can't hand the gift to someone in person, you can consider sending the money online. When you give money to someone, you'll want to keep a number of factors in mind. Giving money often entails certain risks, such as theft or fraud. To better ensure your money goes to your loved one, you can take some steps to protect it. First, try to avoid sending money in the mail. Thieves often target mailboxes, especially around the holidays. If your card with cash is stolen, anyone can use the cash. When you send money online, choose a reputable company to make the transfer. Many established money transfer apps like PayPal and Venmo use encryption to reduce fraud and help you send money securely. Before you give money as a gift, consider all the tax implications for you and for your recipient. The amount of tax you may have to pay will depend on the value of the gift. Tax implications can include a potential annual gift tax, lifetime gift tax, or capital gains tax. Annual Gift Tax: If your gift is worth more than the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) limit, you will be responsible for paying the gift tax. For 2024, you cannot give more than $18,000 (or $17,000 in 2023) without paying taxes on the excess. However, you can give up that amount to multiple people. If you give over that amount, you will need to report it to the IRS using Form 709. The IRS changes the gift tax annual exclusion limit regularly. Lifetime Gift Tax: The IRS also limits how much you can give in your life time without incurring a gift tax, although most people do not reach this limit. For 2023, the lifetime gift tax exclusion is $12.92 million. For 2024, that amount is $13.61 million. If you have given gifts worth more than this amount over the course of your life, you will be responsible for paying the federal gift tax. Like the gift tax, this amount is adjusted for inflation each year. If the amount of the estate passed on exceeds the lifetime exclusion limit, the executor of your estate will need to report it and file Form 706. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) more than doubled the lifetime gift tax exclusion, and those provisions are set to expire in 2025. Capital Gains Taxes: The gift recipient will be responsible for paying capital gains taxes whenever they sell an asset such as a stock or a bond. For 2023 and 2024 tax years, the capital gains tax rate is usually no more than 15% of the gains for individuals. If you're giving money in a way that it can increase in value through an investment, you essentially pass on a capital gains tax liability along with the gift. Be sure the recipient understands they may have to pay taxes on gains. Money may seem like an impersonal gift, but there are countless ways to add a special touch, from using a unique package to including a thoughtful message. Try one of these creative ways with your gift: If you want to go a bit beyond giving money as a gift, you can give digital assets like stocks or bonds. Let\u2019s look at some of the common asset classes that may be suitable to give as digital gifts. Stocks: Stocks are shares of ownership in a company and they can be gifted that match your recipient\u2019s hobbies, interests, or values. The value of a stock is affected by the company's performance and broader market conditions. You can give someone stocks in several ways, including by: transferring shares from your brokerage account to your recipient\u2019s, using an online app specializing in stock gifting, or gifting shares directly through the company. Anyone who receives stock will need to have their own brokerage account. Bonds: Bonds are debt issues. You earn a fixed income as the company or government repays the debt with interest. The gift of a fixed-income investment can provide predictable payments with lower risk than other assets like stocks. There are several types of bonds. Corporate bonds generally require a high minimum investment, so many gift-givers turn to U.S. savings bonds. Because they are backed by the U.S. Treasury, savings bonds are considered a low risk investment. You can buy a savings bond for as little as $25 from the TreasuryDirect website and then transfer the asset to the recipient\u2019s TreasuryDirect account. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a pooled security, which is made up of a basket of different investments. This can be a great alternative to stocks and bonds, which give the recipient a stake in just one issuer. When you give an ETF as a gift, your recipient gains exposure to a particular asset group but with more diversity than buying a single stock. Just like stocks, ETF shares can be transferred from your brokerage account, using an online gifting platform, or directly through certain ETF issuers. Gold or Silver: Precious metals can be a great way to store value and provide benefits when the economy is unstable. If you want to give a digital gift of gold or silver, you may want to consider gold-focused ETFs or shares in mining companies. You can give bullion, coins, or jewelry. But remember that there are costs associated with delivery, storage, and insurance. Cryptocurrency: Cryptocurrencies, even with their notorious volatility, can make excellent gifts because the recipient can receive the potential for significant gains without risking their own money. If you\u2019re comfortable giving an asset with a high level of risk, these digital assets are fairly easy to buy and gift to someone else. You can buy assets through a\u00a0cryptocurrency exchange\u00a0and then transfer them to your recipient's digital wallet. Some sites offer cryptocurrency gift cards that your recipient can then redeem. The new cryptocurrency owner will need a way to store the keys to the digital gift\u2014the safest of which is keeping the asset offline, where it is less vulnerable to hacking and theft. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): An NFT is essentially an online digital file made available for exclusive ownership. Like cryptocurrency, NFTs are highly volatile and speculative investments, with a value that is based exclusively on what another buyer might be willing to pay for it. If you can tolerate the risk, NFTs could make an appealing gift because they are unique collectibles. The general process of gifting an NFT involves buying the asset from a marketplace, then transferring it to the recipient\u2019s NFT wallet. The specifics may differ based on the NFT marketplace you use, which, in turn, vary based on their processes and the types of NFTs that they offer. Credit Card Rewards Points or Miles: If you are looking for a present for an avid traveler, one digital asset that you could consider is your credit card rewards points or miles. With most types of credit cards, you cannot transfer your rewards or miles directly to someone. Instead, you can redeem the points for frequent flyer miles and then transfer those to your gift recipient. You also may be able to use your points to buy gift cards or other merchandise that you can give as a gift. Use reputable online transfer services like Apple Cash, MoneyGram, or Western Union to give money online securely. These established companies use encryption to protect your information from fraudsters. Always avoid sending money to someone you do not know. Yes, there may be tax considerations depending on the amount and purpose of the gift. You'll want to consider potential taxes like capital gains tax, annual gift tax, and lifetime gift tax. The IRS changes the rates and limits for taxes on gifts each year. You can present money as a gift in a variety of fun ways. For example, you can fold money creatively, attach it to another gift, create a money tree, or add it to a personalized gift.

            "content": "Affluent millennials are economically optimistic, but afraid to invest Investopedia\u2019s Affluent Millennial Investing Survey has revealed that nearly half of affluent millennials say they'll be forced to work beyond retirement age, yet nearly all said their personal or family financial situation will improve over the next decade, making them more optimistic than both their Gen X and Gen Z counterparts. The survey asked 1,405 respondents to share how they view investing, who taught them, and how that education influences where they spend, save, and invest. The results also revealed that despite their greater than average income, affluent millennials are still surprisingly reluctant to enter the stock market. According to the survey, almost 40% of this well-off cohort stated they believe investing is \u201crisky,\u201d with nearly a quarter labeling it \u201coverwhelming.\u201d Why are affluent millennials so wary of the stock market, despite decades of evidence that investing pays off in the long term? Trepidation about stocks and a lack of knowledge about investing are major factors propelling the investment jitters of the wealthy millennials in our study, despite their median income of $132,000. (Median HHI for millennials as a whole is $69,000, according to the Pew Research Center).\ufeff\ufeff Our survey revealed that less than half of affluent millennials feel confident about investing and retirement planning. In fact, only 37% of affluent millennials feel knowledgeable about investing at all. High-income millennials who feel knowledgeable about investing are 5X more likely (73% vs. 14%) to feel very confident in their ability to make their own financial decisions. Further, affluent millennials who consider themselves financially knowledgeable are more likely to associate investing with positive emotions, and less likely to find it intimidating, risky or overwhelming. \"It gives me a feeling of control and power,\" said one millennial. \"I feel in charge of my own future by handling my finances correctly,\" said another. \"I love crunching numbers and seeing how I can grow my wealth,\" said a third, suggesting that despite some trepidation to invest, affluent millennials are still seeking a sense of control over their financial futures. The study also found that affluent millennials, despite having a longer window to invest and recoup losses, displayed surprisingly cautious investing habits. They are significantly less likely than Gen X to own stocks (37% vs. 47%), but just as likely as Gen X to own bonds (19% vs. 18%), and more likely to allocate their income to a low-yield savings account (21% vs. 16%). Why do affluent millennials display an aversion to entering the market, despite a larger income to work with? Fear of losing money, founded or otherwise, is the main reason people think investing is too risky for them, says Ted Jenkin, CFP\u00ae, CEO and cofounder of oXYGen Financial in Alpharetta, Georgia. Indeed, the Great Recession, the gig economy, and the burden of student debt have rendered millennials a cautious generation. Yet their fear is a catch-22: coming of age amidst global financial turbulence alerted them to the importance of avoiding risky financial decisions, but investing could play a crucial factor in making up for the stagnant wages of the post-recession generation. Sophia Bera, CFP\u00ae, of Gen Y Planning says she would tell a millennial hesitant to invest in stocks that \u201cyou\u2019re probably already invested in stocks if you participate in your work 401(k) plan. It\u2019s important to have different buckets of money to serve different goals.\u201d Bishop suggests that clients invest in ETFs instead of individual stocks, because people tend to be too emotional about individual stocks, buying or selling on feelings rather than sound investment decisions. Investing in mutual funds, ETFs and index funds that hold baskets of stocks can help manage risk through diversification. Raised in an era of economic uncertainty, it\u2019s no wonder many millennials with money (to lose) seek professional advice. 43% of the affluent millennials surveyed said they use a financial advisor: and those who consider themselves knowledgeable about investing are more than 2X as likely to have a financial advisor than their less knowledgeable peers. Notably, 27% of those who reported using a financial advisor said their investments perform extremely well\u2014 double the number of affluent millennials without financial advisors who said their investments perform extremely well (13%). Nearly two-thirds (65%) of the affluent millennials surveyed said they trust financial advisors, compared to only 58% of Gen Xers. They also trust books (58%), TV shows (54%), newspapers (53%), podcasts/radio (49%), magazines (48%), websites/blogs (37%), and YouTube (or similar video platform) videos (27%) for financial advice\u2014just not as much as advisors. Our affluent millennials surveyed explained why they trust financial advisors the most: \u201cI feel the personal connection gives them more stake in my success,\u201d said one; \u201cBecause they have received the most training, schooling, etc. in the field and are the most knowledgeable\u201d according to another. Other affluent millennials cited the ability to have a two-way conversation and develop personalized strategies, and the belief that financial advisors are accountable since their careers depend on knowledge and expertise. Despite this willingness to work with advisors, however, some also demonstrate a healthy dose of skepticism. One affluent millennial said that while financial advisors were her go-to source because of their specialized training, they still needed to earn her trust and she asks lots of questions to test their knowledge. The way affluent millennials feel about managing their finances often reflects how effectively their parents managed money. Only 9% of those who said their parents were good at managing finances said they feel \u201cvery anxious\u201d about managing their own money as adults, compared to 24% of those who said their parents were not good at managing finances. Conversely, among respondents who said their parents successfully managed their money, 46% have high confidence in managing their finances, compared to only 30% of those who said their parents were ineffective at managing finances. What motivated one affluent millennials\u2019s first investment was \"a life lesson from my pops.\" Another respondent explained: \"I was told that I have to start thinking beyond myself and think about my future family.\u201d The takeaway? Modeling responsible financial behavior and talking about money with your kids may make them better investors. Data backs up common sense. Investopedia sought to examine what motivated investment decisions for a generation that came into adulthood during the great recession and has notoriously encountered a variety of challenging economic factors. In order to understand attitudes around investment, we studied those who should have disposable income to invest, referred to as \u201caffluent millennials.\u201d By examining a segment of the population that makes a greater than average yearly income for their age group, we hoped to eliminate financial hardship from the reasons they may not invest. The Investopedia Affluent Millennials Survey reveals the importance of financial education, as evidenced by those who learned about investing as a teenager feeling confident enough to invest as an adult. Further, observing how their parents managed finances has shaped many affluent millennials\u2019 confidence as adults as well.\u00a0Earning a good income alone doesn\u2019t always go hand-in-hand with knowing how to invest or feeling comfortable managing money. Based on these findings, here are four ways affluent millennials can plan more effectively for their financial future: According to Scott A. Bishop, CFP\u00ae, executive vice president of financial planning at STA Wealth Management in Houston, \u201cNot investing is what is risky. If you don\u2019t save or invest, the true risk is that you will never have any level of financial independence.\" Pew Research Center. \"Young Adult Households Are Earning More Than Most Older Americans Did at the Same Age.\""
