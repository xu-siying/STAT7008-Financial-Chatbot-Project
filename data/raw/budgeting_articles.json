            "title": "How to Save Money for Your Big Financial Goals",
            "content": "Plan so you're covered for emergencies, college, retirement, and more Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University. Spending comes naturally for many of us. Saving, however, can take a little practice. This article offers practical advice on how\u2014and where\u2014to save for three big goals: financial emergencies, college, and retirement. But the strategies it outlines can apply to many other goals, such as saving for a new car, a down payment on a home, the vacation of a lifetime, or launching your own business. Before you get started, it\u2019s worth taking a look at any outstanding debts you have. It makes little sense to pay 17% in interest on credit card debt while earning 1% (or even lower in some cases) on a savings account. So consider tackling the two in tandem, putting some money toward savings and some toward your credit balances. The sooner you can pay off that high-interest debt, the sooner you\u2019ll have to put more into your savings. The goal for most individuals and families should be an emergency fund that's large enough to handle serious, unexpected expenses, such as a costly car repair, medical bill, or both. An emergency or rainy day fund can also tide you over for a while if you lose your job and need to hunt for a new one. Unless you\u2019re already a big saver, your take-home pay is a fair approximation of your monthly living expenses, and it\u2019s easily found on your pay stubs or bank statements. Financial planners commonly recommend setting aside at least three months of living expenses. Others say you should put away anywhere between six months to a year's worth of expenses. These figures work for retirees as well. But it's always a good idea to make a few extra calculations. Consider all of your monthly expenses and contrast that with your monthly income, including Social Security, pensions, liquid assets, and investment income. You'll also want to factor in the risk associated with any stocks and other volatile investments you have in a bear market. To access your money quickly in an emergency, the best place to keep it is in a liquid account, such as a checking, savings, or money market account at a bank or credit union, or a money market fund at a mutual fund company or brokerage firm. If the account earns a little interest, all the better. In most cases, these accounts will allow you to write a check, pay a bill online, or use an app on your phone. You can also move money by electronic wire transfer from your account to someone else\u2019s when you need to do so. If you get a debit card when you open your account, you\u2019ll be able to withdraw cash from an automated teller machine (ATM). Consider using all or part of any money you earn outside of your usual paycheck. That may be a tax refund, a bonus, or income from a side gig. If you receive a raise, try to contribute at least a portion of that to your account as well. Another time-honored tip is to pay yourself first. This means treating your savings like any other bill and earmarking a certain percentage of every paycheck to go into it. To avoid the temptation of simply spending the money, consider direct deposit. Or you can have it deposited to your checking account and then transferred automatically to your emergency fund. Saving for a rainy day is certainly easier said than done for many of us. For instance, someone who nets $50,000 a year would need to set aside anywhere between $12,500 to $25,000. If they devoted 10% to emergency savings, it would take two and a half years in the first instance and five years in the second, not counting any additional contributions or interest the account might earn. If you ever need to take money out of your emergency fund, make sure you replenish it as soon as possible. Retirement is the single largest savings goal for many of us. But the challenge can be daunting. Fortunately, there are several smart ways to set money aside, many of them with tax advantages as an added incentive. Besides a bank or credit union savings account, there\u00a0are individual retirement accounts (IRAs) for just about anybody. Tax-advantaged accounts include 401(k) plans for private-sector employees and 403(b) plans for employees of schools and nonprofits. The easiest, most automatic way to save for retirement is through an employer plan, such as a 401(k). The money comes out of your paycheck automatically and goes into whatever mutual funds or other investments you\u2019ve chosen. You don\u2019t have to pay income tax on that money, on the interest, or on any dividends your plan earns until you eventually take it out. For 2024, you can put up to $23,000 a year into a 401(k) plan, which is an increase from the $22,500 limit for 2023. If you're 50 and over, you can contribute an additional $7,500 (for both 2023 and 2024). As still another incentive, many employers will match your contributions up to a certain level. For instance, if your employer kicks in another 50%, a $10,000 investment on your part will be worth $15,000. The table below shows you how compounding works with your retirement savings, assuming you invest the full $23,000 every year and are guaranteed a 5% return each year. If you\u2019re fortunate enough to have even more than the 401(k) maximum to set aside for retirement or if you don't have an employer-sponsored plan available, consider an IRA. You can invest in either the traditional variety, where you get a tax break when you put money in, or a Roth IRA, where the money you withdraw someday can be tax-free. College may be the second biggest savings goal for many of us. And just like retirement, the easiest way to save for it is to do so automatically. Each state has its own 529 plan and, in some cases, several. You don\u2019t have to use your own state\u2019s plan, but you\u2019ll generally get a tax break if you do. Some states allow you to deduct your 529 plan contributions, up to certain limits, on your state income taxes and won\u2019t tax the money you take out of your plan as long as you use it for qualified education expenses, such as college tuition and housing. The federal government doesn\u2019t offer any tax breaks for the money you put in, but, like the states, won\u2019t tax the money you take out as long as it goes toward qualified expenses. How much you can contribute to a 529 plan depends on your state. While there are no annual contribution limits, states may put lifetime caps on how much you can put into their 529 plans. For example, a 529 plan balance in New York can\u2019t exceed $520,000 for a single beneficiary. You can also use a 529 plan to pay up to $10,000 a year in tuition at an elementary or secondary public, private, or religious school. Under the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act of 2019, a lifetime limit of $10,000 from a 529 plan can be used to pay off student loans. Most of us are likely to have more than one savings goal at any given time, and a limited amount of money to divide among them. If you find yourself saving for your retirement and a child\u2019s college at the same time, one option to consider is a Roth IRA. Unlike traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs let you withdraw your contributions (but not any earnings on them) at any time. You may have to pay a penalty for early withdrawals, so be sure to do your research if you're under 59. This means you can use a Roth IRA to save for retirement, and if you come up short when the college bills arrive, tap into the account to pay them. The downside is that you\u2019ll have that much less money saved for retirement when you may need it all the more. For 2024, the maximum allowable IRA contribution (for traditional and Roth IRAs combined) is $7,000. People 50 and older can contribute an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution, which hikes the limit to $8,000. This is an increase from the 2023 limit of $6,500 or $7,500 if you're 50 and older. If you need to save more money than you can easily pry out of your paycheck, here are a few ideas that financial planners often suggest to consumers. People often find they\u2019re frittering away funds on things they don\u2019t need and could easily live without. Record every penny you spend for a certain period of time, whether that's a week or a month. You can use a notebook or an expense-tracking app, such as Clarity Money or Wally. Some apps even save for you. For example, the Acorns app links to your payment card, rounding up your purchases to the next dollar, and moving the difference into an investment account. As long as you buy things you truly need, it may make sense to sign up for apps such as Ibotta or Rakuten. Apps like these offer cash back from retailers on groceries, clothing, beauty supplies, and other items. You can also use a cash rewards credit card, which offers 1% to 6% in cash on each transaction. For instance, the Chase Freedom card offers 5% cash rewards on categories that change periodically. This tactic only works if you transfer your savings to a savings account and always pay your credit card bill in full every month. Clipping coupons is fine, but you\u2019ll save much more money by paring back on the biggest bills in your life. For most of us, that\u2019s things like housing, insurance, and commuting costs. Ask yourself the following questions: You might want to dine out less often, try to get a few more wearings out of your wardrobe, or drive the old car for another year. But unless you enjoy living like a miser\u2014and some people actually do\u2014don\u2019t deny yourself every last pleasure in life. The point of saving money is to build toward a financially secure future\u2014not to make yourself miserable in the here and now. If you're looking to stash away $1,000 cash right away, here are a few options. Sign up for direct deposit through your employer (if you haven't already) and schedule automatic transfers to a savings or other emergency account. You can pad this account by signing up for cash-back apps or credit cards. If you want to sock away money for retirement (which, yes, counts as savings), take advantage of a 401(k) or automatic withdrawals from your account into an IRA. The 30-day rule is simple. It's a savings rule that aims to help you get your mindset onto saving rather than spending. If you're online or walking through the mall and see something you like and are about to check out, stop. Log off or turn around. Delay the purchase for a month and, instead, put the money you would have spent into your savings account. Once you're beyond the 30 days, you can revisit the purchase again. You need discipline and a plan in order to save money. Know what your goals are and how much you need to set aside. Take advantage of the options available to you, whether that's an employer-sponsored retirement account or an IRA. Make sure you have assets that can be easily liquidated when you need money during emergencies. And be sure to consult a financial professional to help point you in the right direction. Saving money is crucial for a secure financial future, one that involves little debt and allows you to live comfortably and build wealth. As life progresses, there are many important situations that require spending, such as paying for school, a house, your child's schooling, and retirement. Utilizing a variety of saving strategies for each different occasion will allow you to approach these expenses from a prudent financial standpoint.

            "content": "Set yourself on the path to financial freedom with these 12 habits Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. David Lees / Taxi / Getty Images Financial freedom\u2014having enough savings, investments, and cash on hand to afford the lifestyle you want for yourself and your family\u2014is an important goal for many people. It also means budgeting to grow a nest egg that will allow you to retire or pursue any career you want\u2014without being driven by the need to earn a certain amount each year. Unfortunately, too many people fall far short of financial freedom. Even without occasional financial emergencies, escalating debt due to overspending is a constant burden that keeps them from reaching their goals. When a major crisis\u2014such as a hurricane, an earthquake, or a pandemic\u2014completely disrupts all plans, additional holes in safety nets are revealed. Trouble happens to nearly everyone, but these\u00a012 habits can put you on the right path. Being financially independent means having sufficient income, savings, or investments to live comfortably for life and meet all of one's obligations without relying on a paycheck. That is the ultimate goal of a long-term financial plan. What is financial freedom to you? Everyone has a general desire for it, but that's too vague a goal. You need to get specific about amounts and deadlines. The more specific your goals, the higher the likelihood of achieving them. Write down these three objectives: Next, count backward from your deadline age to your current\u00a0age and establish financial mileposts at regular intervals between the two dates. Write all amounts and deadlines down carefully and put the goal sheet at the front of your financial binder. Making a monthly household budget\u2014and sticking to it\u2014is the best way to\u00a0guarantee that all bills are paid and savings are on track. It\u2019s also a regular routine that reinforces your goals and bolsters resolve against the temptation to splurge. Credit cards and other high-interest consumer loans are toxic to wealth-building. Make it a point to pay off the full balance each month. Student loans, mortgages, and similar loans typically have much lower interest rates; paying them off is not an emergency. However, paying these lower-interest loans on time is still important\u2014and on-time payments will build a good credit rating. Pay yourself first. Enroll in your employer\u2019s retirement plan and make full use of any matching contribution benefit, which is essentially free money. It\u2019s also wise to have an automatic withdrawal into an emergency fund,\u00a0which can be tapped for unexpected expenses, as well as an automatic contribution to a brokerage account or something similar. Ideally, the money for the emergency fund and the retirement fund should be pulled out of your account the same day you receive your paycheck, so it never even touches your hands. Keep in mind that\u00a0the recommended amount to save in an emergency fund depends on your individual circumstances. Also, tax-advantaged retirement accounts come with rules that make it difficult to get your hands on your cash should you suddenly need it, so that account should not be your only emergency fund. Bad stock markets\u2014known as bear markets\u2014can make people question the wisdom of investing, but historically there has been no better way to grow your money. The magic of compound interest alone will grow your money exponentially, but you do need a lot of time to achieve meaningful growth. However, remember that\u2014for everyone except professional investors\u2014it would be a mistake to attempt the kind of stock picking made famous by billionaires like Warren Buffett. Instead, open an online brokerage account that makes it easy for you to learn how to invest, create a manageable portfolio, and make weekly or monthly contributions to it automatically. We\u2019ve ranked the best online brokers for beginners to help you get started. Achieving financial freedom can be very difficult in the face of growing debt, cash emergencies, medical issues, and overspending, but\u2014with discipline and careful planning\u2014it is possible. That is the ultimate goal of Your credit score is a very important number that determines the interest rate you are offered when buying a new car or refinancing a home. It also impacts the amount you pay for a range of other essentials, from car insurance to life insurance premiums. The reason credit scores have so much weight is that someone with reckless financial habits is considered likely to be reckless in other areas of life, such as not looking after their health\u2014or even driving and drinking. This is why it\u2019s important to get a credit report at regular intervals to make sure that there are no erroneous black marks ruining your good name. It may also be worth looking into a reputable credit monitoring service to protect your information. Many Americans are hesitant to negotiate for goods and services, because they're afraid that it makes them seem cheap. Conquer this fear and you could save thousands each year. Small businesses, in particular, tend to be open to negotiation, so buying in bulk or positioning yourself as a repeat customer can open the door to good discounts. Review relevant changes in tax law to ensure that all adjustments and deductions are maximized each year. Keep up with financial news and developments in the stock market and do not hesitate to adjust your investment portfolio accordingly. Knowledge is also the best defense against fraudsters who prey on unsophisticated investors to turn a quick buck. Taking good care of property makes everything from cars and lawnmowers to shoes and clothes last longer. The cost of maintenance is a fraction of the cost of replacement, so it\u2019s an investment not to be missed. Learn to know the difference between the things you want and the things you need. Mastering a frugal lifestyle means developing a mindset focused on living a good life with less\u2014and it's easier than you think. In fact, before rising to affluence, many wealthy individuals developed the habit of living below their means. This isn\u2019t a challenge to adopt a minimalist lifestyle. It simply means learning to distinguish between the things you need and the things you want\u2014and then making small adjustments that drive big gains for your financial health. Once you\u2019ve gotten to a point where you\u2019ve amassed a decent amount of wealth\u2014either liquid assets (cash or anything easily converted to cash) or fixed assets (property or anything not easily converted to cash)\u2014get a financial advisor to help you stay on the right path. The principle of proper maintenance also applies to your body\u2014and taking excellent care of your physical health has a significant positive impact on your financial health as well. Investing in good health is not difficult. It means making regular visits to doctors and dentists, and following health advice about any problems you encounter. Many medical issues can be helped\u2014or even prevented\u2014with basic lifestyle changes, such as more exercise and a healthier diet. Poor health maintenance, on the other hand, has both immediate and long-term negative consequences on your financial goals. Some companies have limited sick days, which means a loss of income once paid days are used up. Obesity and other dietary illnesses make insurance premiums skyrocket, and poor health may force early retirement with lower monthly income for the rest of your life. Everyone defines financial freedom in terms of their own goals. For most people, it means having the financial cushion (savings, investments, and cash) to afford a certain lifestyle\u2014plus a nest egg for retirement or the freedom to pursue any career without the need to earn a certain salary. The 50/30/20 budget rule, popularized by Senator Elizabeth Warren, is a guideline to achieve financial stability by dividing after-tax income into 3 categories of spending: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and paying down debt. We have built an easy-to-follow budgeting calculator to help you categorize and control your spending and saving\u2014which is the essential first step toward financial freedom. Although some states\u2014including California, Hawaii, Washington, Massachusetts, and Michigan\u2014limit or prohibit the use of credit scores to determine auto insurance rates, many companies do use a credit-based scoring system to decide whether to insure you and how much you will pay. These 12 steps won\u2019t solve all your money problems, but they will help you develop the good habits that get you on the path to financial freedom. Simply making a plan with specific target amounts and dates reinforces your resolve to reach your goal and guards you against the temptation to overspend. Once you start to make real progress, relief from the constant pressure of escalating debt and the promise of a nest egg for retirement kick in as powerful motivators\u2014and financial freedom is in your sights.

            "title": "Salary vs. Hourly Pay: What\u2019s the Difference?",
            "content": "Compensation for work comes in different forms. Two of the most common types of compensation are salaries and hourly pay. A salary is a specific amount of compensation regardless of the number of hours worked. Employees who are paid a salary are not eligible for overtime pay. Hourly pay is the rate paid per hour of work. Employees who are paid by the hour are eligible for overtime pay equal to their base wage plus 50%. An employee generally has to earn at least $684 per week or $35,568 per year, be paid on a salary basis, and perform exempt duties that require discretion and independent judgment at least 50% of the time to be considered exempt. You\u2019re probably exempt if you take on managerial duties. You can be paid a salary so your employer doesn\u2019t have to pay you overtime wages no matter how many hours you work. A salary is a fixed wage, usually cited as a monthly or annual salary. This means that your paycheck is for the same amount each time it arrives when you earn a salary. An annual wage is a term of your employment and it's how much you'll receive for as long as you hold the same job or until the terms are renegotiated. It's a type of implicit cost for your employer. Salaried employees receive a fixed rate of pay but there can be a downside to this type of compensation. If you receive a salary, you have specific goals, responsibilities, and/or tasks that must be met or completed even if that means longer hours and working weekends without any additional compensation. Working additional hours (without extra pay) may make it more difficult to separate work and personal time and achieve a work/life balance. And it can mean added stress and pressure to complete your tasks even if that means sacrificing your own time. A salary comes with an inherent sense of security. Employers can cut the hours of a nonexempt worker easily but renegotiating a salary is more complicated. If you're an hourly employee, you're paid for all the hours you work. Your employer must pay you more if they want more of your time. Legal overtime is time and a half and some employers may pay double time for holidays. Overtime hours and pay are normally part of an employment contract. But keep in mind that allowing overtime is at the discretion of the employer. Working hourly means you could bring home more than if you earned the same official pay on a salaried basis if you\u2019re in a well-compensated field with lots of available overtime. There\u2019s also an effect on lifestyle. Hourly employees can find it easier to separate home and work. They can concentrate on family, hobbies, or a second job when their work is over for the day. But being paid hourly also makes you more vulnerable. Hourly employees often feel the impact first when laws change or their company goes through tough times. It\u2019s easier for an employer to knock off some of your hours until business improves than it is to eliminate an entire salaried position. Hourly employees protected by a union may be protected against some of these risks, however. There also are possible effects on eligibility for healthcare coverage. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires businesses with 50 or more employees to provide healthcare to full-time employees, who are defined as people working 30 or more hours. Some businesses keep hourly employees to fewer than 30 hours to avoid this mandate. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) governs which type of payment an employee receives. You can\u2019t negotiate whether your job is exempt or nonexempt because of the terms of the FLSA. The duties you perform determine your job category regardless of your job title. An implicit cost is money that a company or firm spends on resources that it already has in place. It's more or less a voluntary expenditure. Salaries and wages paid to employees are considered to be implicit because business owners can elect to perform the labor themselves rather than pay others to do so. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) indicates that American workers earned a median income of $1,118 per week in the third quarter of 2023. This includes both wage earners and salaried employees. The figure dropped to $1,005 for women. It increased to $1,208 for men. Half of all workers earned more than this median and half earned less. The national unemployment rate was 3.7% as of November 2023. The rate was less than this in 19 states, however. There are both pros and cons to being an hourly versus a salaried employee. But salaried employees enjoy more benefits for the most part, such as paid vacation and sick days, retirement accounts, and other employer-sponsored benefits. Hourly workers don't usually receive compensation in the form of paid leave by the companies who hire them and they may be responsible for their own healthcare. But hourly employees enjoy more autonomy and may even be able to set their own hours.

            "title": "Budgeting for a New Baby: Ongoing and One-Time Expenses",
            "content": "The arrival of a new baby can be both exciting and financially overwhelming. A tiny new baby can mean big changes and major expenses for new parents. How much money can you expect to spend on your little one in the first year? What financial tools should you consider creating? Here we'll show you how to financially prepare for your family's newest addition before they arrive. In this scenario, we look at the first baby. That means starting from scratch in many areas such as furniture, strollers, and cribs. There is, of course, also the one-time medical expense of delivering a baby in the United States. As we'll see, this expense is by far the hardest to pin down in any meaningful way. In the U.S., the average new parent with insurance coverage can expect to pay almost $14,000 for their labor and delivery, according to a 2020 research article published by the Healthcare Cost Institute. Vaginal deliveries can cost from $7,000 in Arkansas to $17,000 in New York. Interestingly, out-of-pocket costs also exhibited a wide range, from $1,000 in D.C. to $2,400 in South Carolina. (2017 was the most recent year for which data was available.) It is important to remember that the cost of routine birthing care is highly variable based on your location and insurance coverage. If you have an insurance policy, review it to determine your out-of-pocket costs for prenatal care, hospital stay, tests, and postpartum care. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to accurately predict how much you'll pay without reviewing the health coverage you have available to you. An insurance policy and location are important factors when determining how much the delivery of a baby will cost. If you lack a private insurance program, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) could be options for you and your child. The one-time purchases for babies are as variable as medical costs but for different reasons. This category can go up exponentially depending on the wants of the parent. To get out and about you will most likely want to purchase a stroller, an infant car seat (required by law), a baby carrier, and a diaper bag. If you plan on being out a lot, a portable playpen and/or bassinet may make sense. Like many of the things on this list, there is a wide range of costs. Buying an adapter, snuggle bags, and another option for some brands of strollers can be a $1,000 price tag without taking in the cost of the stroller itself. On the other end of that range, a seat and stroller combo can still be purchased new for under $150, and used equipment or hand-me-downs can fill in for all the others. It is worth noting that, at the very least, it is worth buying a new infant car seat. There is no foolproof way to ensure that a used one hasn't been compromised in a previous accident or through hard use. To keep your child occupied, you may want to consider a portable swing, bouncy seat, play mat, and/or jump seat. You may also want to have a crib and/or bassinet, crib mattress, basic bedding with blankets, a changing table, a small dresser, a rocking chair, a monitor, and a diaper pail. Again, this is an area where personal preference dictates cost. Unlike car seats, everything is for use at home, meaning that you can buy it used or even acquire it through one of the many share and swap groups you'll find online. Feeding costs for your new infant do, of course, vary like everything else based on your particular situation. A birthing parent who can stay at home and has no issues breastfeeding around the clock will see very minimal costs for months before a high chair and dishes are required. In that situation, some things like a breastfeeding pillow, burp cloths, or even a cape are more than enough. If the parent will be storing breast milk for use, then items like bottles, nipples, cleaning equipment, and a single or dual breast pump come into play and your budget will increase. If breastfeeding isn't possible, formula feeding will add significant costs to your first year of parenting. For those interested in a non-biological child, adoption comes with its own set of expenses, including cash payments, medical assistance. The actual costs vary wildly but can go as high as $50,000 or more. Some employers offer adoption benefits such as time off or financial assistance. There are also government programs worth exploring. Once your baby arrives, the regular expenses to care for your little one kick in. Factor the following costs into your budget. If both you and your partner will work after your baby's arrival, your single biggest budget item will be child care. Your child care costs vary by where you live, the age of your child, how much care you require, and what type of care you use. The Care Index\u00a0pegs in-center child care costs at just under $10,000 per year. The average cost of a nanny or other in-home care is around $28,350 a year, but again that can be higher or lower based on location and so on. Keep in mind, though, some costs might be offset by various tax credits, such as the child and dependent care credit. Be sure to confirm if you are eligible. Food, such as Gerber formula, clothing, and diapers make up most of the necessities in the ongoing costs. Once you begin feeding your child solid food, you can expect to spend roughly $100 a month. The early food costs for children are relatively small compared to what you will see from a teenager. According to the USDA's most recent The Cost of Raising a Child report, it's advised that new parents should estimate clothing costs at around $670 up to $1,110 for the first two years. The amount ranges greatly based on personal preference and budget, but the lower end falls around $56 a month. Diapers also vary in cost, but experts advise that you should budget at least $1,000 for diapers and $450 for wipes for the first year alone. That's approximately $120 a month. Parents who choose to use disposable diapers should also expect to go through as many as 3,500 diapers in their child's first year alone. Making homemade cloth diapers out of repurposed fabrics (either fabrics you have on hand, or inexpensive fabrics found at thrift stores) is an option that would reduce diaper costs significantly. Plan on six wellness visits the first year for evaluations, immunizations, etc., and a few additional visits for illnesses. Check your health insurance policy for your rates. If you become a stay-at-home parent, there are important budget changes to consider. The most obvious is reduced family income. Despite the high cost of child care, the cost of one partner leaving an income behind to commit to full-time parenting can be much higher in terms of lost income, benefits, and investment. Under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), your employer may grant you up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave for your baby's arrival. Here again, nothing is set in stone as small businesses do not fall under the FMLA. So check to see what type of leave you may qualify for with your employer. If you take unpaid leave, calculate your regular expenses during that period\u2014mortgage, utilities, insurance, groceries, etc.\u2014and determine how you will meet those costs. This is compounded by diminished earning potential if that partner decides to resume their career. The decision to stay home can be personal or financial\u2014at lower income levels, even government programs cannot balance the high costs in some regions. If it is for personal reasons, however, a couple can at least try the one-income budget before birth to get an idea for it while building an emergency fund with the second income at the same time. With your child's arrival, you'll want to create financial tools to help provide for your child's future. Determine your priorities to begin budgeting. According to the College Board Report, the average cost per year for college in 2021 to 2022 ranged between $10,740 to attend a public four-year in-state school and $38,070 for a private four-year education. Start saving now through one of several college education investment tools, such as a 529 plan, Coverdell Education Savings Account, or UGMA/UTMA account. There have been some changes to the way some accounts can be used\u2014namely the 529 plan. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 and the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act (SECURE) of 2019 have expanded the use of 529 plans to include K to 12 education, apprenticeship programs, and the ability to pay down student debt. The SECURE Act 2.0, passed in January 2023, offers another newly expanded benefit for 529 plans. It allows beneficiaries of these plans to roll over up to $35,000 from any 529 accounts in their name to a Roth IRA in their name over the course of their lifetimes. If you do not have life insurance, now is the time to buy it if you can afford to do so. For just a few dollars a month, you can be assured that your child will have financial resources if you and/or your partner were to die unexpectedly. Talk to your employer or an insurance agent for options on both life insurance and disability insurance. Without health insurance, just one serious accident or illness could deplete your savings and put you in significant debt. Investigate your insurance options if you don't already have coverage, or budget for the increased monthly premium to add your child to your policy. Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) enable you to use pretax dollars to pay for important family budget items, like child care and healthcare expenses. Talk with your employer or financial advisor about setting up a dependent-care FSA and/or healthcare FSA. No matter your income, however, there are numerous ways to meet your new baby's needs without breaking the bank that we've hinted at throughout. Namely: Children are a wonderful gift\u2014if sometimes an expensive one. The main thing to keep in mind is that averages don't mean much when the range is as wide as it is with costs around a baby. Good health insurance can protect you from hospital bills for the most part, but only planning and budgeting can help you handle the rest. The Finnish practice of sending birthing parents home with a simple starter box that can double as a baby bed shows that many of the thousands of dollars spent on our children's first years are more for our status than their well-being.

            "content": "Smart ways to juggle these competing demands on your resources Katie Miller is a consumer financial services expert. She worked for almost two decades as an executive, leading multi-billion dollar mortgage, credit card, and savings portfolios with operations worldwide and a unique focus on the consumer. Her mortgage expertise was honed post-2008 crisis as she implemented the significant changes resulting from Dodd-Frank required regulations. Mira Norian / Investopedia If you\u2019re looking to buy your first home and are saddled with student loan debt, you may have a decision to make. Should you use your resources to pay off your student loans more quickly, save up for a down payment on a home, or try to do both at the same time? Arguments for saving up for a down payment first include: Reasons to pay off your student loans first include: Deferment or forbearance of your student loans is generally a bad idea if you can avoid it. It may not hurt your credit rating, but interest will continue to accrue. Making regular payments keeps you on track to pay off your loans on time. You may decide that you can handle paying down your student loan debt while also saving for a down payment on the home of your dreams. This can take some effort, but is entirely possible if you follow some simple guidelines: This includes car loans, credit cards, student loans, and any other type of debt you have. Include the remaining principal (balance), interest rate, and minimum monthly payment for each one. Pay as much as possible on the loan with the highest interest rate. Pay at least the minimum due on all others. Once you have paid off the highest interest rate debt, roll that money into the next debt and continue the process until all is paid off. If you\u2019re struggling to make payments, consider tabling the thought of owning a home for a little while (since even with down payment funds, lenders need to ensure you can repay your mortgage and other bills as well) and consider seeking debt relief. Keep your down payment savings separate from your checking account to avoid spending it. Open a savings account that pays the highest rate (online banks tend to be the most competitive) or set up an investment account to increase your potential yield over time. Be aware, however, that investing is risky, and you could lose a good chunk of your money in a down market. Consider refinancing or consolidating your student loans to lower payments or the interest rate. Find out if you are eligible to convert to an income-based repayment plan. Mortgage lenders will use your standard repayment plan to calculate your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, so lowering your payment may not help you qualify for a home loan; however, if you save money on your monthly payment, you can apply the difference to your down payment. You should have an emergency fund of three to six months\u2019 income and retirement savings to round out your financial picture. Each of these is a separate account. If your job offers a 401(k) or similar retirement plan, make sure you put enough in it to take advantage of any employer matching. To obtain a conventional loan without the extra expense of private mortgage insurance (PMI), you will need a down payment equal to 20% of the selling price. If your down payment is less than 20%, then mortgage insurance will add 0.3%\u20131.5% to the cost of the total loan. Federal Housing Administration\u00a0(FHA)\u00a0loans require only a 3.5% down payment but come at a higher interest rate and require mortgage insurance. If you qualify for a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan, these loans come with zero down payment requirements and include other benefits for former military service members. Additionally, there are a number of low down payment programs available if you qualify. A Conventional 97 loan is another option. The 97 refers to the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, where you are able to borrow up to 97% of your home\u2019s value. Saving automatically, such as through direct deposit or automatic transfers from your checking account, can make saving for a down payment easier. The following savings strategies may help you save for a down payment faster: Use direct deposit or automatic transfer from your checking account to move a regular amount to savings. If you treat saving as an ongoing expense, you will be more likely to do it. Work bonuses, holiday gift checks, rebates, and tax refunds can all go into savings. Avoid the temptation to spend that money, and you will realize your savings goal sooner. Look for places to cut spending and divert that money into savings. Places to cut include entertainment, eating out, subscriptions, expensive vacations, and clothing. If you rent, consider moving back in with your parents (with their permission, of course)\u2014offer to pay something for room and board. Income from a part-time job that can be dedicated to savings will help you reach your goal more quickly. You could also try asking for a raise at your current job or volunteering to work overtime. To start saving toward a house, you have to commit to the process. If you need help, consider setting up an automatic transfer to regularly move money from your checking account to a dedicated savings account. There are a variety of factors to consider when choosing between buying a house or paying off a student loan, and the correct decision will vary from person to person. To determine which might be right for you, consider your priorities, time frame, and financial situation. You absolutely should pay off your student loans. In fact, you will likely save money in the long run by taking care of your student loan debt as quickly as possible. Consider refinancing or consolidating your student loans to secure a lower monthly payment and/or interest rate. It\u2019s often possible to save for a down payment on your first home while paying off your student loan debt\u2014you may not have to choose between the two. Keep in mind that circumstances change, and what\u2019s impossible now may be possible in a year or two. Reevaluate your situation as needed, and be prepared to alter your plans as necessary.

            "content": "Amy Fontinelle has more than 15 years of experience covering personal finance, corporate finance and investing. Getty Images / Natalia Gdovskaia If you\u2019re trying to make every dollar count, finding new ways to save while shopping can be a game-changer. With so many choices and prices out there, a few smart strategies can help you keep more money in your wallet\u2014without any special skills. Whether you\u2019re shopping for essentials or treating yourself on a budget, becoming a savvy shopper is a simple way to stretch your finances a little further. Here are five easy tips to help you get started. Most people's default response is to go to a store anytime they need something, but that's not the only way to obtain a needed item. Ask yourself the questions below about the desired item. If you don't need something right away, and you usually don't, it's worth searching on community ad sites like Craigslist or Kijiji. Another idea? Sign up some local Freecycle groups, and ask around to see if anyone you know is getting rid of whatever you want. Many home improvement stores even have tools you can rent. Likewise, instead of spending money on the latest bestseller novel that you will probably only read once, head down to your local library and see if you can borrow the book. This tactic can be a great money-saver for any item that you use infrequently or will only need to use once. For example, if you only need to use a drill once a year when you change apartments and have to reinstall your curtain rods, you can simply borrow a drill from someone else. Some prices are set in stone, and it's a waste of time trying to negotiate with someone who won't budge. However, when you think there's some wiggle room, consider the strategies below. While you probably can't negotiate the price on many items, there are plenty of situations where you can negotiate, even in a retail store. For example, if an item is cosmetically damaged, a store may be willing to offer a small discount because that blemished item\u00a0tends to be more challenging to sell. If a salesperson wants you to buy a bunch of extras with a new computer or\u00a0phone plan, ask for a discount. If you're buying an item from a private party that is used, you can always negotiate. This is because negotiation is standard practice on these types of purchases, and the sticker price is generally higher than the amount the seller will accept. Bartering\u00a0can be complicated because many people are not accustomed to doing it, and it may be\u00a0hard to find someone who wants the service or goods you have to offer in exchange for what another person is selling. If you have some valuable products or services to offer, however, and you're purchasing from a private party, it's worth asking. Even if the other party isn't willing to barter for the entire item, they may be agreeable to at least reducing the price in exchange for an hour of your expertise. If you wait to purchase something until you need it, you're likely to pay the sticker price, but with a little advanced planning, you can save big bucks. For example, ask yourself the questions below. If you want a new electronic device, like an iPhone, you may have to wait for a lower price. Usually, once a newer model comes out, the regular price will usually drop as supply increases and demand drops. As new items become more popular, even if they don't officially go on sale, you may be able to get a good deal on Amazon or eBay. Black Friday sales are usually a good time to score expensive or popular items, as well. Certain everyday items, like groceries, toiletries, and cosmetics, will always go on sale sooner or later, providing an opportunity for you to stock up when your favorite brands are priced at a discount. For anyone who doesn't carefully follow the latest fashion trends, clothes are best purchased during end-of-season sales, even if it means you don't get much use out of them until the following year. Combine sales with coupons, and you'll save even more. eBay can be a great source of coupons, such as ten buy-one-get-one-free coupons\u00a0of your favorite deodorant. The coupons might cost you $2.50 total, including postage, but if you use all 10 of them, your net savings on a $3 stick of deodorant will be at least $27.50 plus tax. If you have time to look through a few pages of content, then sites that offer free printable coupons, like Coupons.com, could be a good option for you too. When shopping online, search for the store's name plus \"coupon code\" before making a purchase. Many sites will advertise coupon codes to help give consumers a break. Sometimes you'll enter coupon codes to no avail, but sometimes you'll get lucky and get some savings like $5 off shipping fees or 20% off your entire purchase. It's always worth taking a few minutes to look. Finally, apps like Rakuten and\u00a0Ibotta\u00a0offer cashback on items ranging from groceries to clothing to hotels and much more. It's usually a bad idea to buy an item in the first place you see it because it's very likely it is cheaper somewhere else. For expensive purchases where you have a lot to gain by comparing prices, and for situations, like online shopping, where it's straightforward to compare prices, the savings you'll achieve are worth the extra time and effort. However, don't bother if you won't save much or are likely to waste a lot of time, gas, and money by shopping around. If you're pressed for time, you can avoid shopping around altogether by making a habit of doing all of your shopping at stores that regularly offer bargain prices, and you'll be confident that you're already getting a good deal. If the item you want to buy doesn't quite fit into your budget, think about similar but less expensive alternatives. Figuring out the real reason behind a pending purchase can help you brainstorm ways to achieve the same result more affordably. For example, if you're worried about being bored during a long flight, you may want to buy a spare battery for your laptop so you can get some work done. In this case, your primary concern isn't getting more work done but rather finding a way to occupy your time. Instead of buying that extra battery, you could use your laptop in the most energy-efficient setting until the battery runs out and then spend the rest of the flight reading a library book. Wish lists can go a long way toward preventing impulse buying. By keeping a never-ending wish list, a person is less likely to buy items that have not been contemplated for at least a month, which provides sufficient time to decide whether the item is a necessity or just a want. It's not worth signing up for store credit cards just to get the discount that is offered. Store credit cards usually come with high APRs and misleading terms that can cost you a lot down the road unless you are vigilant about paying your bill on time. If the mere prospect of saving money isn't enough incentive, consider the opportunity cost of buying an item. Maybe that new suit or purse isn't worth it when you could use the money toward going on a vacation. If you usually head straight to your favorite website, specialty store, or the mall when you need to buy something, consider these other shopping options that can save you a great deal of money. Garage sales, moving sales, and estate sales tend to offer all types of merchandise at much lower prices than retail stores. You are most likely to benefit from this type of shopping experience for items that are not necessarily needed right away, such as goods like canning jars, dishes, or a jewelry organizer. This can also apply to more practical products as well. Don't expect to find\u00a0everything at these sales, but do check them out from time to time to add value to your shopping budget. Consider big-box discounters as a source for the same products you usually buy at more expensive, specialized stores. You may not have ever thought of the drugstore as a specialty store, but when you start comparing their regular prices to those of discount stores like Costco,\u00a0Sam's Club, and\u00a0BJ's\u00a0Wholesale, you might change your mind. Even on inexpensive items like shampoo and toothpaste, drugstore prices can be significantly higher. As a bonus, you can knock out several visits to smaller stores with one visit to a big box store, saving you time. But keep in mind that it doesn't always make sense to buy in bulk. Costco,\u00a0Sam's Club,\u00a0and\u00a0BJ's all charge annual membership fees that can easily offset your annual savings, and many people can't use up an extra-large container of pretzels before they get stale. The ideas presented in this article might seem excessively frugal to some, but when you cut costs in lots of little ways, you can achieve significant savings without making big sacrifices. Even thinking about how to save money on relatively minor purchases, like cans of soda or packs of gum, can result in significant savings when you buy these items habitually. It doesn't take much time or energy to get into the habit of considering your purchases more carefully. You may not always make the choice that will save you the most money and instead opt for convenience, but at least you will have made a conscious and well-informed decision.

            "title": "Why Buying In Bulk from Stores Like Costco Can Come with Hidden Costs",
            "content": "Getty Images / krblokhin Thinking about stocking up to save big? Buying in bulk from stores like Costco or Sam's Club seems like a no-brainer for cutting costs, but here\u2019s the surprising truth: it could actually be draining your wallet instead. While grabbing a massive pack of your favorite products may feel like a deal, many shoppers end up spending more overall than they realize. Here\u2019s why buying in bulk might not be as budget-friendly as it looks. Imagine your favorite shampoo costs $12 per 20-ounce bottle. You find out that you can buy a 180-ounce bottle for a mere $45. What a deal!\u00a0For about four times the price, you receive six times more shampoo. After doing the calculations, you decide to buy the larger bottle of shampoo. However, was this investment worth it? As a side effect, you might end up using more shampoo because there is no longer any point in skimping. On the flip side, you could get sick of using the same shampoo and switch to a different brand before finishing off the larger bottle. Or, for perishable goods such as food, buying in bulk is not always cheaper if the food expires before you can eat it! Buying in bulk saves money per unit, but consumers must be wary of the utility of the extra goods. Although the per-unit price may be low, the overall purchase price is higher than the price of just buying what you need for the week or month. When people are in the store and find a year's supply of crackers for mere pennies a package, they often forget to consider whether they need or want that many crackers. Signs like \"super deal\" and \"unbelievable savings\" may cloud their thinking. The difference to your shopping budget if you buy a $45 bottle of shampoo versus a $12 one may mean that you need to put the groceries on your credit card. Ultimately, the higher price could have immediate financial implications, and may or may not pay off 12 months down the road. Another factor that bulk-shopping enthusiasts may not consider is the cost of storage. While Americans have some of the largest refrigerators in the world, there is still a healthy market for freezers, dry storage bins, and other food storage devices when the fridge runs out of space. Bulk buying may force you to purchase more storage and pay the continuing cost of storing food, such as the electricity bill for a larger fridge and a freezer. Bulk buying often encourages overconsumption, which can lead to financial strain and waste. When you purchase larger quantities of a product, you may find that you aren't able to use all of it before it goes to waste. This impulse to consume more than necessary can cause you to go through items faster than you intended, which negates the savings you thought you were getting. The problem with overconsumption isn't just about using up products, but about purchasing more than you can realistically use. As a consumer, the drive to take advantage of \"deals\" or \"savings\" can cloud your judgment and lead you to buy excess, which eventually results in wasted goods or unnecessary clutter in your home. This behavior can affect your budget and space, making bulk buying a questionable strategy when it encourages buying more than you truly need. Not always. While the per-unit cost is often lower, bulk purchases can lead to higher overall spending, increased waste if items go unused, and additional costs for storage, making it less cost-effective in the long run. Buying in bulk can strain storage space, encourage overconsumption, lead to wasted goods (especially perishables), and tie up more money upfront, which may actually hurt your budget rather than helping it. Bulk buying is best suited for non-perishable items you use consistently, like household supplies, and for larger households where items are consumed quickly\u2014otherwise, it may be wiser to buy only what you need. The best way to reduce expenses is not by always buying more of a particular product to get a bulk discount, but by being judicious of what to buy in bulk and when to use less or substitute for a cheaper product. Bulk buying is often best described as something you don't need a lot of at a price you can't pass up. It is worth noting that bulk buying does make\u00a0sense for many people, especially those with large households. However, the practice has become so widespread that people are often buying bulk based on a price point, rather than the eventual use they'll get out of a product."

            "title": "Is Tipping Culture Out of Control? When It's OK To Skip the Tip",
            "content": "sutiporn somnam/Getty Images We are all familiar with the following situation: you just ordered a coffee, and after tapping your credit card, the pay kiosk swivels around to show the suggested tip amount of 25% to 30%. What do you do? Nowadays, many Americans are feeling confused about tipping protocols. According to poll findings released by Pew Research Center, among nearly 12,000 U.S. adults, only about a third say it\u2019s extremely or very easy to know whether or how much to tip for different services. Although there's no definitive method for determining tipping rules, here\u2019s what you should know about the history of tipping, recent developments that have changed tipping culture, and how to approach tipping going forward. Tipping in the U.S. has a complex history. It was largely unknown in the U.S. before the Civil War but gained traction as wealthy Americans returned from visiting Europe, bringing the practice back home with them. Tipping is also said to reflect a darker aspect of American history, as it grew when the restaurant and hospitality industries began hiring newly emancipated Black women and men. They often weren\u2019t offered a wage but instead relied on gratuities to earn a living. The request for tips has surged with the advance of technology, as the option for tipping appears more frequently. Digital payment systems take advantage of design principles that influence tipping behavior. For instance, clicking \u201cno tip\u201d on a kiosk feels more challenging than deciding not to tip unprompted. This has led to a phenomenon known as \u201cguilt tipping,\u201d where consumers feel pressured to leave a tip. Many restaurant and hospitality workers struggled during the height of COVID-19. Thus, tipping increased to help support these industries. According to an analysis of tip data by the National Library of Medicine, while tip-per-order was decreasing before the pandemic, it increased by $1.24, thus countering the previous negative trend. Tipping expectations haven\u2019t seemed to lower since the pandemic. This could explain why the tipping amount has stayed up over the last few years, coined \u201ctipflation\u201d by news outlets. According to poll findings released by Pew Research, around 7 in 10 adults say tipping is expected in more places today than it was five years ago. Today, many service workers rely on tips for their livelihood. The Department of Labor considers a worker a \u201ctipped employee\u201d if they regularly receive more than $30 per month in tips. Under federal law, employers of tipped workers are only required to pay $2.13 per hour in direct wages as long as this amount, combined with tips, meets the federal minimum wage. The employer must cover the difference if the total does not reach the minimum wage. Some states set a higher tipped minimum wage. For example, the tipped minimum wage in Alaska is the same as the standard minimum wage ($11.73 per hour as of 2024). Other states, such as Florida and Maine, set tipped minimum wages that exceed the federal mandate but don't match the state standard minimum wage. Cities and localities may also set higher minimums in some areas. New York City has a tipped minimum wage of $10.65 (as of 2024), 65 cents higher than the state-mandated tipped wage. And \"quick service employees\" in New York state earn the same $15-per-hour minimum wage whether they're tipped employees or not. Tipping is a hot topic of the upcoming election, as both presidential candidates propose exempting tips from taxes. You should expect to tip in places like restaurants, bars, salons, and hotels. This includes servers, bartenders, hotel bellhops, delivery drivers, valet drivers, and more. It\u2019s also customary to tip your hairstylist, nail artist, and food delivery driver. The actual tip amount varies depending on the service, but restaurants generally follow a 15% to 20% rule. RealSimple offers a tipping etiquette guide with specific suggestions about when and how much to tip. For food delivery apps, a fair amount can be $3-$5 per delivery. If the weather conditions are rough, consider adding a few extra dollars. According to CNBC, tipping isn't expected for counter workers since they typically earn a wage. However, leaving a tip can be a thoughtful gesture, especially if you're a regular customer, as it can help establish a positive relationship with the staff. Sometimes, restaurants already apply an automatic gratuity, especially for large parties. Since it\u2019s already included, there\u2019s typically no expectation to add to that. With that in mind, if you had great food and service, a 5-10% extra tip is a nice way to show your appreciation. If your expectations weren\u2019t met, it\u2019s acceptable to tip less than usual\u2014some people may tip as low as 10%, but it\u2019s advisable not to go below that. Be mindful of conditions out of your server\u2019s control, like the kitchen running slow. Unless the service is terrible, most etiquette experts recommend not skipping the tip for restaurant workers. You shouldn\u2019t tip professionals that are paid a salary. This includes teachers, plumbers, lawyers, and cable techs. Salaried workers, like teachers, for instance, aren\u2019t expecting a tip. However, there are other ways to show your thanks. Consider giving a gift card around the holidays, or writing a handwritten card. And of course, giving a verbal \u201cthank you\u201d does not go unnoticed. When you look at your bill, this could be listed as a \u201cservice fee\u201d or \u201cgratuity.\u201d Tipping culture in the U.S. is shaped by history, economics, and evolving social norms. Changes in technology and a post-pandemic world have left many Americans unsure of what to do. However, researching and staying current on these practices can paint a clearer picture of tipping expectations. By doing so, we can ultimately help both customers and employees.

            "content": "Natalia Lebedinskaia / Getty Images Fifty percent of credit cardholders in America have debt, as of June 2024, according to a Bankrate survey. Furthermore, a MarketWatch Guides survey found that over 66% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck\u2014and nearly half consider themselves broke. It's easy to overspend. The cost of living spiked sharply during the pandemic, and although inflation has since stabilized, many goods, including grocery staples, remain over 40% higher in 2024 than in 2020. Other factors leading to overspending include limited financial planning, low income, and unexpected emergencies. A budget can help ensure that your income aligns with your spending. These secrets to budgeting better can help you take control of your financial future. Basic budgeting includes listing your income and expenses, setting financial goals, making a plan, and regularly reviewing it to make adjustments as life happens. Here's how to make a budget that truly works for you. Many people feel guilt or shame about their financial situation, preventing them from making life-changing shifts. Rather than focusing on the numbers, focus on your purpose\u2014why you want a better financial future. For some, it is to reduce daily stress; for others, it is to help a family member or friend in need. No matter your why, start there. Visualize how you\u2019d reach those goals if only you could maximize your earnings and spending. Remember to write down your why and put it in places you\u2019ll see throughout your day\u2014in the bathroom mirror, in a notebook at work, in the vanity mirror in your car, on a sticky note in your wallet\u2014so that when the urge to splurge creeps in, you have the motivation to stick to the plan. The best budgets are ones you can stick to. That means they are realistic from the outset. Rather than creating an ideal fictional budget, commit to one based on actual spending. This helps ensure your situation doesn\u2019t worsen by letting harmful habits run wild. Knowing that today\u2019s spending is the worst it\u2019ll ever get means you\u2019re starting with a quick win. Common advice says to track your monthly spending, but that can feel intimidating. Instead, track a typical week and do the math to extend those numbers for a month. This exercise lets you see what you\u2019re dedicating your dollars to right now. Over time, you can realistically lower your spending strategically to close the gap between your current and ideal budgets. For another motivational push, divide the total number by 7 to see how much money per day you need to finance your current lifestyle. This can be your income goal when asking for a raise, changing jobs, or starting a side hustle. One myth of implementing budgets is that you need to have lots of willpower to make them work. Thanks to banking automation, that\u2019s just not true. Make your budget a blueprint by setting up direct deposit and recurring payments from your bank account. You'll reduce the temptation to splurge as well as ensure that you're not hit with late fees or missed payments that further diminish your available cash. Based on your budget, set your accounts to save some portion of your income automatically\u2014no matter how small\u2014for your why. Automating your money will mean that each dollar fulfills its role in your budget blueprint without any interference or temptation. The investment research firm Morningstar says that learning to master delayed gratification is one of the key components of financial well-being that a budget brings. Get in the habit of regularly reevaluating your wants vs. your needs to ensure that your budget is helping to accomplish your goals. Wants are things you desire but can live without, like entertainment, travel, luxury cars, and non-essential clothing. Needs include housing, healthcare, and transportation. Impulse buying is often tied to emotional spending from underlying psychological causes that a budget alone won\u2019t fix. Instead, try using your budget to normalize waiting for what you really want. Asking yourself two questions can stem the cycle of overspending: Consumer debt like high-interest personal loans and credit cards present a major obstacle to achieving financial freedom. Other debt, like affordable mortgages and low-interest educational debt, can be worthwhile investments in your future. The secret is to stay educated about your debt and how you can reduce the amount you\u2019re paying toward interest over the life of the loan. This is especially important for debt used to pay for depreciating assets like recreational items and vehicles. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach to paying off debt, but use your budget to choose a method you can consistently maintain. Try the snowball method, the avalanche method, or a sinking fund. To make significant progress with debt payoff, you can consolidate debt to simplify the payoff and negotiate better terms. Your budget can also help you make the best use of any windfalls like bonuses, inheritances, or tax refunds. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Americans' most significant expense is housing, including rent, mortgage payments, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and home repairs. Zillow data shows that the median rent in the U.S. in September 2024 is around $2,100 per month, and the average home price in the United States\u00a0is over\u00a0$361,000 (up\u00a02.9%\u00a0over the past year). Whether you rent or own, housing maintenance and utilities are significant additional outlays. The BLS reports that Americans splurge most on food delivery, eating out, entertainment, and apparel. Nearly 74% of Americans have a budget, but the effectiveness of that budget can vary significantly by generation and family composition. This budgeting rule suggests that working adults allocate 50% of their income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to save for retirement and other goals. The three P's of budgeting are Paycheck, Prioritize, and Plan. Evaluate your paycheck and other income, including bonuses, alimony, child support, tax refunds, or rebates. Prioritize spending by considering your needs, wants, and why. Plan to get the most value for every dollar earned and spent by keeping a budget. According to the Federal Reserve survey, only 63% of adults said they could cover a hypothetical $400 emergency expense with cash on hand. Although many factors contribute to overspending, setting a budget can help you establish new, healthy financial habits. Begin by assessing your current expenditures and wants vs. needs through budgeting apps. Then, automate banking and bill payment to ensure that every dollar furthers your financial goals. Don\u2019t be discouraged by occasional setbacks. Unexpected expenses like medical emergencies or repairs will arise. Instead, get in the habit of reassessing your budget and finetuning it as needed.

            "content": "First payday? Here's how to put that money to work Katie Miller is a consumer financial services expert. She worked for almost two decades as an executive, leading multi-billion dollar mortgage, credit card, and savings portfolios with operations worldwide and a unique focus on the consumer. Her mortgage expertise was honed post-2008 crisis as she implemented the significant changes resulting from Dodd-Frank required regulations. Maskot/Getty Images Your first job after high school or college comes with a critical rite of passage into adulthood\u2013earning a regular paycheck. Sometimes, that first paycheck can be a bit of a letdown. You may be surprised that your net earnings are considerably lower than the gross amount. Plus, not all paychecks are created equal depending on your job. You may even panic a little about how you will cover all your expenses. The good news? It is possible to get what you need out of your paycheck. Budgeting, financial planning, prioritizing savings, and paying down debt are all ways to help you manage your money, one paycheck at a time. At one time, when an employee received a paycheck, they were handed a literal paper check with all the withholdings listed on it. While employers still provide paycheck notices, most issue paychecks via direct deposit directly into employees' bank accounts. If you're not in the habit of looking at your digital pay stub, it can be easy to overlook how taxes and deductions affect your pay. Sometimes withholdings can even be surprising, says Joni Alt, a certified financial planner and senior wealth advisor at Evermay Wealth Management. \"I remember after my daughter graduated from college, she and her friends had started their jobs, and they were at our house, and the conversation was, 'What is FICA, and why did they take my money?'\" shares Alt. \"I chuckled because they were becoming adults in real life.\" Alt suggests that young people should educate themselves about FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act), the paycheck contributions that fund Social Security and Medicare. Employees and employers split FICA contributions, paying 6.2% each toward Social Security and 1.45% each toward Medicare in each paycheck. To estimate your net pay, you must calculate your FICA contributions, plus other withholdings like state and federal taxes, shared costs for employer-sponsored health insurance, and contributions to retirement funds like a 401(k) or 403(b). This will enable you to create a budget. How much money is withheld depends on your salary, where you live, and how many dependents you have. Typical withholdings include: Let's say you earn $61,600 a year, the median earnings for a 25- to 34-year-old with a bachelor's degree, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics. At this salary, your gross pay would be $61,600. Divide that by 12 and you have your monthly gross pay of $5,133.33. To figure out your net pay, determine how much you contribute to FICA, federal and state taxes, health insurance, and retirement contributions. Then, subtract those contributions from your gross pay. Here's an example of how to determine monthly net pay, assuming a 12% effective federal income tax rate and 4% state tax: After these expenses, your monthly take-home pay would be $3,305.97. If you get paid semi-monthly or weekly, divide your yearly pay by the number of paychecks you receive per year, determine your payroll deductions, and subtract those deductions from your gross pay. Try online paycheck estimator tools like the ones at ADP and Charles Schwab to get a quick estimate of your net pay. Creating a budget is the best way to track your income, expenses, savings, and discretionary spending. It can help you decide where you need to save or splurge. According to a survey by Empower, 53% of Americans across generations found learning how to make a budget to be their most valuable financial lesson. (The next most popular lesson: creating an emergency fund.) Having a budget is especially useful when cost-of-living expenses, like groceries and rent, are high. Today, many Americans report feeling pinched due to inflated prices at the supermarket and the gas pump. Plus, over half of U.S. renters are paying over 30% of their income on housing, including utilities, as reported by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. Using an expense tracking app is a great tool to help you understand where you're spending each month. They can help you avoid keeping track of paper receipts and provide immediate feedback. There are several ways to create a budget, including using pen and paper or one of the many budgeting apps. Popular budgeting plans include: \"When my son was in high school and would ask for money, I would ask him if this was a want or a need,\" shared Alt. \"The answer often depended upon the current environment and time. People can control how much they spend and/or save. It's a choice. The 50/30/20 rule is a good guide and starting point. But everyone has a unique situation, so slight modifications may be needed.\" The most important thing when creating a budget is to consider your individual situation, according to certified financial planner Melissa Joy. \"I don't subscribe to any one particular rule about budgeting because they all have benefits, and what works for your budget may not work for your roommate, for example, if you have student loans and they don't,\" says Joy, who also hosts the Women's Money Wisdom podcast. Ultimately, Joy advises making sure to \"pay yourself first to meet your needs and understand that there isn't a one-size-fits-all-all budget. It depends on your own situation.\" It can feel difficult to part with your paycheck for a future you can barely imagine, but the earlier you start investing in your retirement, the better. Contributing your retirement early adds up, thanks to compound interest, which allows you to earn interest on your principal and then interest on that interest, growing over time. In addition, any amount contributed to a 401(k) or 403(b) is subtracted from your gross pay, which lowers your taxable income. Find out if your employer offers a retirement plan; if so, allocate a percentage of your pay to that account. Some employers will offer to match (up to a certain percentage) their employees' contributions. Taking an employer match is one of the easiest ways to start investing in your retirement, and it is essentially free money. Other accounts you can consider funding, even a small amount if you can afford it, are: \"I would recommend starting an emergency savings account, over investing in stocks and mutual funds, or opening a Roth or IRA when you are first starting out,\" says Joy. After you create an emergency fund, Joy suggests contributing to another account, such as an HSA, which can be used as emergency reserves for medical expenses.\u00a0Note that you are only eligible to contribute to an HSA if you have a High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). Joy also encourages young people to take advantage of high-yield savings accounts. \"At this time, these types of high-yield savings accounts can pay off, and there are plenty online to consider that offer high interest rates,\" she shares. Alt agrees about using a budget as a beginning point and starting an emergency fund first; when you get that going, \"put money into saving in your company retirement plan to maximize employer matching contributions.\" She encourages young people to pay down debts such as student loans, credit cards, and other personal loans. \"If there are still extra funds left in your monthly budget, consider contributing to your Health Savings Account (HSA) if available and finally to taxable investments.\" If your current budget doesn't stretch to allow for extra saving at first, practice patience patient. By sticking to a budget, you'll pay down your debts and create room to set aside more funds to save and invest, which will pay off in time. Unfortunately, most graduates leave school with some debt, either student loans, credit card debt, or both. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the amount of student loan debt in the United States was $1.6 trillion, approximately $37,087.96 per borrower.\u00a0 The College Board estimates that half of the students (2021-2022) from public and private institutions who graduated with a bachelor's degree have student loan debt; the average debt amount was $29,400 per loan holder. According to a 2023 study by Experian, the average credit card debt among Generation Z (18 to 26 years) is $3,262. It's not surprising that experts say paying down debts is an important part of budgeting your paycheck. Figuring out the best way to pay down your loans for your individual circumstances is key. \"I recommend doing a personal finance audit every month or so of how you are spending, and then see where you can cut back and put more money towards debts or investments,\" suggests Joy. When you need to tackle debt, there are options, such as the snowball method, where you pay off your smallest debts first, or the debt avalanche strategy, where you pay the minimum amount due on all debts and then use any extra money left to pay the card or loan with the highest interest. You could also choose to use a debt payoff app. \"Make sure you make your student loan payments on time, and investigate if you qualify for student loan repayment plans or student loan forgiveness programs,\" says Joy. In terms of credit card debt? \"Get rid of it, especially the cards with high interest rates,\" she recommends. If you don't have a credit card, be careful about taking them out, especially if you are on a tight budget. \"I would not recommend getting a card unless you can afford to pay it off each month,\" cautions Joy. \"And if you have debt that you can't manage, consider credit counseling with a reputable advisor.\" Learning more about personal finance is a good way to prepare yourself ahead of time for managing your money in those first paychecks at a new job. Many books for a younger audience, personal finance podcasts, apps, and even banking or investment websites are available. \"I like the podcast Money Wisdom,\" shares Joy. \"\u2018[And] You Need a Budget' is a good budgeting app if you like to track everything because it offers feedback on your finances,\" she recommends. \"Also, check to see if your workplace offers meetings with financial advisors connected to the retirement plan you are enrolled in.\" Alt asked her younger colleagues to get a sense of what they like in a budget app. \"I decided to take a census of the 'young people' in my office about budget apps. Simplifi by Quicken was at the top of the list, followed by Excel spreadsheets. Rocket Money had an honorable mention because it helps identify all the subscription services being utilized and where there might be overlap,\" shares Alt. She advises young people learning to manage their paycheck to be cautious of the financial education provider, especially if they are trying to sell a product or service. \"Those are not the people you necessarily want to speak to because it might not be in your best interest,\" she explains. Joy advises that people should \"take everything from financial influencers on social media with a grain of salt. It's always best to speak to professionals for advice.\" If your family has a financial advisor or planner, ask your parents about meeting with them. They will likely be a trusted source for advice, and you may be able to pay by the hour for guidance. \"If that's not available, do research online and look for a fiduciary (an advisor that must put their client's interest ahead of their own). The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) is a terrific way to research and look for an advisor that is a fiduciary,\" suggests Alt. The 50-30-20 rule is a form of budgeting in which you divide your net income into three areas: 50% goes to expenses (needs) like shelter, transportation, and groceries; 30% goes to wants, like entertainment or other non-essentials, and 20% on savings, like a high-yield savings account or an investment account. Pay yourself first is a personal finance strategy recommended by many financial planners and advisers. This means setting up automatic payments from your paycheck to be delivered straight to a retirement or savings account before you get a chance to pay monthly expenses or engage in any discretionary spending. Likely, your direct deposit is linked to a checking account that offers no interest or much less interest than a savings account, especially a high-yield savings account. Interest on savings accounts varies from financial institution to financial institution. As of May 2024, the best option for earning interest on a savings account is 5.55% at My Banking Direct, a service of Flagstar Bank, N.A. By comparison, a Sapphire Chase Checking account only offers 0.01% interest. You should always try to take advantage of any matching program your employer offers by contributing at least the percent that they will match. Most financial experts recommend contributing anything versus nothing, but if you can contribute up to 10% or 15% of your annual salary to a retirement account, it will likely pay off over time. If you cannot afford that amount, try to add 1% incrementally to your contributions each year. Budgeting apps take the guesswork out of a paper-and-pen budget by allocating funds to different categories as set by the user. There are many budgeting apps on the market\u2014some are free, others have fees. The one you use should align with your personal budgeting style and easily integrate with your financial accounts and your phone. When you get your first full-time job, it may feel challenging to see your net pay and understand how to make it work for you. However, there are several strategies that you can use to help, including setting a realistic budget, contributing to an emergency fund, participating in your employer's retirement plan, and taking advice from the right financial experts. A little planning today will set you up for a positive financial future.

            "title": "TSA PreCheck or Global Entry: Which Should You Choose?",
            "content": "Consider where you\u2019re traveling\u2014and how often\u2014to help decide Michela Buttignol/ Investopedia TSA PreCheck and Global Entry are trusted traveler programs under the Department of Homeland Security and can help make your travel days more enjoyable. They\u2019re similar programs, but have some key differences that can help you decide which one is right for you and your adventures. TSA PreCheck offers expedited security screening benefits for domestic flights departing from U.S. airports, allowing travelers to keep their shoes, belts, and laptops on at over 200 U.S. airports and with more than 90 participating airlines. Global Entry includes TSA PreCheck benefits, plus expedited U.S. customs screening for international air travelers entering the United States. Global Entry costs $100 for five years, while first-time enrollment to TSA PreCheck costs $78-$85 for five years. Also, Global Entry includes TSA PreCheck benefits, so if you have Global Entry, you can use dedicated TSA PreCheck lanes for any domestic flights. Both programs require an application with fee, background check, and interview. Not sure which is best for you? Here\u2019s what to consider. Run by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, TSA PreCheck speeds up security screenings for domestic flights departing from major U.S. airports. TSA PreCheck is popular for its efficiency and convenience. With it, you won\u2019t need to remove your shoes, belt, or jacket when you go through security. Additionally, you can keep your liquids and laptop in your bag. If you have children 17 and under, they can join you in the dedicated lanes when traveling on the same reservation and when TSA PreCheck appears on the child\u2019s boarding pass. Overall, the expedited screening process gets you to your gate faster and with fewer surprises. According to the TSA, most enrolled passengers get through security in about 10 minutes. To be eligible for TSA PreCheck, you need to be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or U.S. lawful permanent resident. Citizens of partner countries enrolled in Global Entry, NEXUS or SENTRI can also participate in TSA PreCheck. You\u2019ll also need to pass a background check and have no travel-related violations. To apply, you need to fill out a form online, then go to a 10-minute appointment at an enrollment center. At the in-person visit, they\u2019ll collect your biometric data (fingerprints, photo), verify your identity, do a background check and collect payment. Once approved, you\u2019ll receive a Known Traveler Number (KTN). Add this number to your airline reservations to get \u201cTSA PreCheck\u201d displayed on your boarding pass, granting you access to the designated lines (in most airports) for TSA PreCheck passengers. You will manually add your KTN when booking online via a participating airline website. Some airlines, such as Southwest and American Airlines, allow you to add your KTN to your profile so that it automatically applies to your reservations. Enrollment in PreCheck lasts five years. TSA works with two enrollment partners for PreCheck\u2014Idemia and Telos. First-time enrollment with Idemia is $78, or $85 with Telos. Online renewal is $70 through either provider. If you have a credit card with premium travel benefits, they may provide a statement credit for the application fees of either program. Run by U.S. Customs and Border Protection under Homeland Security, the Global Entry program is more comprehensive, providing additional benefits for preapproved, low-risk travelers arriving in the United States. Global Entry offers all the benefits of TSA PreCheck, plus expedited entry for international travelers. When returning to the U.S. from travel abroad, you get to skip the lines and paperwork at more than 75 airports. Just scan your passport at the Global Entry kiosks, have your photo taken, and you\u2019re done. Global Entry also includes expedited customs screening for international air travelers when entering the U.S. Global Entry is available to U.S. lawful permanent residents and select foreign nationals. The application process is very similar to TSA PreCheck: You need to complete an online application, pay a fee, and submit biometric information in-person for a background check. Unlike PreCheck, the in-person interviews for Global Entry take place almost exclusively at airports, with fewer available locations and appointments. As with PreCheck, you\u2019ll get a known traveler number once approved, which you can add to airline reservations. You\u2019ll also get a plastic ID card for Global Entry. Global Entry costs $100 for five years. Some premium travel credit card issuers, such as Capital One and Chase, offer statement credits for the application cost of Global Entry or PreCheck as benefits on select cards. TSA PreCheck is slightly cheaper and easier to get than Global Entry. However, Global Entry offers more comprehensive benefits on both domestic flights as well as international flights to the U.S. Both offer faster security screening and a smoother airport experience. In general, Global Entry makes more sense if you travel internationally, whereas TSA PreCheck is ideal for domestic travel. You don\u2019t need to get TSA PreCheck if you already have Global Entry, since it\u2019s included. So, if you already have a passport and you can afford the application fee, Global Entry makes sense. On the other hand, if you only travel domestically, just getting TSA PreCheck might be easier since the processing time is much shorter than for Global Entry. TSA recommends enrolling in Global Entry if you travel internationally four or more times a year. Also keep in mind, Global Entry only gives you expedited entry into the U.S. So, there\u2019s no benefit if you travel from France to Nigeria, or from Colombia to Peru, for example. Not sure which one is right for you? Use this calculator at the bottom of this webpage to choose a program based on your travel needs. Here are the steps to apply for Global Entry: 1. Apply online: Create a Trusted Traveler Programs (TTP) account and pay a $100 non-refundable fee. 2. Enroll: Once you receive conditional approval, you have the option to complete your interview upon arrival into the United States at an Enrollment on Arrival location. Or, schedule an interview at a Global Entry Enrollment Center. The application processing time for Global Entry is currently 4-6 months, so make sure to plan accordingly. Customs Border Protection recommends passengers who are flying internationally into the U.S. to complete Global Entry enrollment at an Enrollment on Arrival (EoA) location as an alternative to scheduling an interview at an Enrollment Center. 3. Membership: Once you\u2019ve completed the enrollment interview, your Global Entry membership lasts five years.Here are the steps to apply for TSA PreCheck: 1. Apply Online: Choose your enrollment provider and location near you, and then fill out the online application. 2. In-person enrollment appointment: Attend a 10-minute visit at your chosen provider that includes fingerprinting, document and photo capture, and payment.3. Enjoy TSA PreCheck: Once approved, your membership lasts for five years. Add your Known Traveler Number (KTN) to your airline reservations to make sure you\u2019ll be able to use PreCheck at the airport. For TSA PreCheck, you can use a valid passport, an unexpired U.S. Enhanced Driver\u2019s License (EDL), permanent resident or \u201cGreen Card\u201d, and other acceptable documents. For Global Entry, you must bring a valid passport to the interview. You can use TSA PreCheck for domestic flights departing from U.S. airports,\u00a0including when you depart from a U.S. airport to a foreign country and for domestic connecting flights after you return to the United States. Be sure it\u2019s on your boarding pass when you check in and have your KTN with you if necessary. For TSA PreCheck, most applicants receive their Known Traveler Number (KTN) in 3-5 days, although some applications can take up to 60 days. Global Entry processing times can be longer, with the application process taking up to 6 months. You can, but if you\u2019re going to want both, you might as well just apply for Global entry, since it includes TSA PreCheck. If you have domestic travel coming up soon and you don\u2019t want to wait, get PreCheck. Just be aware that you\u2019ll still have to go through a second process and pay more if you later purchase Global Entry.  At just $22 more for the same perks and more, Global Entry is a comprehensive choice for travelers who want to streamline the airport experience. If you travel both domestically and internationally, it\u2019s likely worth the extra cost and time to get Global Entry since it already includes the benefits of TSA PreCheck. Regardless of which program you choose, planning ahead is key to take advantage of these trusted traveler programs.

            "title": "How To Achieve Financial Independence",
            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Joules Garcia/Investopedia A growing number of women say that achieving financial independence is their No. 1 financial goal, according to a Fidelity Investments Survey. Fifty-eight percent of women surveyed said that they wanted to feel secure and not worry about money. However, only 36% of respondents to REAL SIMPLE and Investopedia's 2024 Her Money Mindset survey said that they held a retirement account, while only 71% said they held a savings account. And 54% said that they struggled to pay at least one major expense. Whether you're hoping to go full FIRE (financial independence, retire early) or just want to feel more on top of your expenses and planning, this guide will offer practical steps to get you where you want to go. \u201cFinancial\u00a0independence\u00a0means different things to different people,\u201d says Walter Russell, an Ohio-based financial planner. \u201cSome see it as (being) free from needing a regular job because they have money from other sources. Others think of it as not owing money to anyone, which makes them feel secure and in control.\u201d Russell continues, \u201cFor some, it's about being prepared for retirement and knowing they'll be okay financially when they stop working. It can also mean having the freedom to start businesses or live wherever they want. It's all about feeling confident and in charge of your money and future.\u201d No matter your definition of financial independence, your end goal probably looks like freedom and autonomy. Your path to that destination will vary depending on your values, resources, and preferences. At a basic level, financial independence means having sufficient income and savings to cover living expenses. If you're financially self-sufficient, you have the resources to fund cost of living. For Brock and Becky Waterman, better known as the FIRE Travel Family, financial independence meant pulling off a wedding on a shoestring budget, selling their home, and leveraging geographic arbitrage to live on less\u2014even with three kids in tow. \u201c[During COVID] I ran the numbers to see where we were, and we figured out if we sold our house and most of our [possessions] and our vehicles...we could go ahead and be financially independent and not have to work,\" says Brock Waterman. After cutting health care costs (almost $2,000 per month because the Watermans owned their own business), child care costs (almost $15,000 per year), and property taxes and insurance, the Watermans had reduced their expenses by more than half. Originally from Wisconsin, Waterman says that living in an RV and homeschooling their kids is an unconventional choice for his family. But they were motivated to spend more time with their kids; financial self-sufficiency helped them achieve their goal. While some people aim for financial independence by working for many years to amass significant savings, the Watermans chose to do the opposite and cut expenses in order to enjoy life now. Dividend-paying stocks, some savings, and a few certificates of deposit have sustained the family thus far, making their decision to travel the world with their kids a no-brainer. Many associate financial independence with not needing traditional full-time employment or a paycheck. Passive income and dividend assets can help power financial independence plans. \u201cInvesting 10-15% of gross income\u00a0for retirement and putting another 20% of your after-tax income toward investing or other financial goals is a fantastic, back-of-the-envelope calculation for most people,\u201d says Anna N\u2019Jie-Konte, a certified financial planner and president of Re-Envision Wealth, when asked what steps she advises people to take to achieve financial independence. While some people can live on savings alone, most have to consider ways they could access cash fast if their circumstances change. Being self-employed or willing to work in a high-demand field as needs arise can make financial independence more accessible even without amassing much savings. Most people think that financial independence requires a high net worth or large windfall. Konte says financial independence is achievable at lower income levels, too. \u201cMany financial planning studies show that in some respects it's actually easier to reach financial independence when you are middle-income because Social Security makes up a greater percentage of your retirement income need, therefore you need to save less of a nest egg on your own,\u201d she says. Brock Waterman agrees. He encourages people aiming for financial independence not to focus on a target savings or investing number. \u201cWhen we worked for ourselves, we were paying a little over $2,000 a month, so $24,000 a year, for health care,\u201d he says. After Becky Waterman closed her massage business and he stopped working, they were able to access subsidized health care because they make less annual income. Brock Waterman estimates that they paid $3,000 or $4,000 for premiums the first year. This year, he says, the family paid only a few hundred dollars on health care. Three years into financial independence, he encourages people to take the leap if they really want it, rather than waiting to hit a specific set number goal. Whether it is fear of an emergency or ambitions to send kids and grandkids to college, long-term security can keep people locked into income-generating jobs that they don\u2019t love. But financial security is just as much about what you want to spend your money on as it is about what you don\u2019t. For example, the Watermans decided against saving for four-year college educations for their kids. Instead, their long-term vision includes setting aside $10,000 to $15,000 per kid to invest in their vocational training, skills building, or launching their own business. \u201cThey'll have the money for community college, and if they decide they want to go to a four-year college, that's going to be something they're going to have to make a decision for themselves,\u201d Waterman explains. Russell adds that discipline in saving, investing, and living below one's means plays a more significant role regardless of income level. \u201cFocus on increasing the savings rate and maximizing investment returns through strategic allocation,\u201d he advises. \u201cHigh-income earners should avoid lifestyle inflation and prioritize long-term wealth accumulation through prudent\u00a0financial\u00a0management and investment strategies.\u201d Those building blocks of financial discipline ensure financial independence for the long haul. While financial independence serves everyone, research shows it holds special significance for women, who typically earn less than men, live longer, and have greater caregiving responsibilities. According to 2022 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, women employed full-time and year-round had median earnings of $52,360, while the median earnings for men employed full-time and year-round were $62,350. REAL SIMPLE and Investopedia's survey data shows a gender wage gap within marriages, too: 60% percent of women respondents with a male partner said that they earned less than their significant other. While progress has been made over time in closing this gender wage gap, the disparities between the earnings of men and women persist. The latest data from The World Bank shows that in 2021,\u00a0 life expectancy at birth was 79 years for women in the United States and 74 years for men. This represents a 5-year difference, with women having a higher life expectancy compared to men. Yet lower wages and long stints without income due to child rearing and caregiving put women at risk of having less cash during their golden years. According to estimates from Fidelity Investments, the average 65-year-old woman can expect to spend about $157,500 more on medical bills throughout retirement than the average 65-year-old man. Longer female life expectancies correlate with a need for larger retirement savings and income to cover additional years of living expenses and health care costs. \u201cWith added responsibility comes additional costs and cash flow pressure,\u201d Konte adds. Women disproportionately shoulder unpaid caregiving duties for children and adult dependents. A 2023 MetLife study found that most caregivers are women, and women providing care to a parent lose as much as $120,000 in lifetime wages due to working fewer hours. If a woman leaves the workforce entirely to provide care, the study found the lost wages rise to around $142,000. Caregiving for kids, spouses, and parents contributes to career impediments,\u00a0lower savings, and higher out-of-pocket care expenses for women than men. Research from AARP shows that Latinx and Black caregivers spend higher percentages of their income on care expenses than white caregivers. So, whether it's earning power, longevity, or caregiving norms, women encounter unique financial challenges that make financial independence difficult to achieve but even more meaningful for disrupting cycles of inequality. Achieving financial freedom rests on embracing an intentional money mindset, goal-focused strategies, and smart financial behaviors over time. It's a lifestyle shift rather than a quick fix. Here are 10 key steps that are an important part of any financial independence journey. Defining your \"why\" gives meaning and motivation to stay disciplined while working toward your unique vision of financial freedom. Whatever your answer, revisit this when you need inspiration to stick to the path. Gaining clarity around your current financial situation identifies opportunities for improvement and savings needed to reach independence. To assess your current financial situation: Once you have a clear understanding of your income and expenses, it's time to calculate your assets and liabilities. Your assets include any savings accounts, investment portfolios, and property values. On the other hand, your liabilities encompass all forms of debt, such as credit card balances, student loans, and mortgages. To calculate your net worth, subtract total liabilities from total assets. This formula provides a snapshot of your current financial health and can serve as a baseline for setting future financial goals. Understanding your tax scenarios is also crucial, as this can influence your investment strategies and overall financial planning. Doing a thorough assessment may uncover excess spending that could be saved or invested to reach financial independence sooner. This intelligence becomes the baseline to set goals against and track progress over time. Although the Watermans discourage it, many people start their financial independence journey by coming up with a number\u2014an ideal savings, investing, or net worth number that would make them feel that full-time work was truly optional. Quantifying your number motivates saving and investing decisions. To determine this: Although the future remains unpredictable, having an estimate keeps your financial behaviors aligned with your target. \u201cFor individuals aspiring to achieve\u00a0financial\u00a0independence\u00a0through investing, several fundamental principles can guide their journey,\u201d says Russell. Starting early and investing consistently harnesses the power of compounding returns over time.\u201d Diversify investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk and improve long-term growth.\u00a0\u201cRebalancing the portfolio periodically ensures alignment with\u00a0financial\u00a0goals and risk tolerance. Continual education about investing strategies and market dynamics empowers individuals to make informed decisions and adapt to changing circumstances on their path to\u00a0financial\u00a0independence,\u201d he adds. He says investing may require the help of a team\u2014a\u00a0financial\u00a0advisor, a tax strategist, and an attorney\u2014whose expertise can help you achieve financial independence even sooner. Alternatively, DIY apps like Acorns, Betterment, Ellevest, and Wealthfront, among many others, offer set-it-and-forget-it retirement investing convenience. Some definitions of financial independence entail being completely debt-free. But, for some people, debt doesn\u2019t derail the dream. \u201cAchieving\u00a0financial\u00a0independence\u00a0while maintaining debt is possible but requires strategic management and prudent decision-making,\u201d says Russell. He says it's essential to differentiate between \u201cgood\u201d debt, such as mortgages or student loans, and \"bad\" debt, like high-interest credit card debt. Russell says, \u201cPrioritizing the repayment of high-interest debt while leveraging low-interest debt strategically can be a viable approach. However, minimizing debt levels or achieving debt-free status can enhance\u00a0financial\u00a0security and accelerate the journey to\u00a0independence.\u201d Minimizing debt levels or achieving debt-free status can help with financial independence. To create a repayment strategy, there are two popular options: the debt snowball and the debt avalanche methods: Debt Snowball: Pay minimums on all debt while putting any extra funds toward the smallest balance first. Once the first debt is cleared, roll its minimum toward the next smallest, and so on until all are repaid. Momentum builds as small wins pile up. This mental boost keeps you tackling larger debts. Debt Avalanche: With this method, arrange debts by interest rate instead of size. Make minimum payments on all while targeting extra funds at the debt with the highest interest rate first. Paying down high rates saves money on expensive financing charges over time. However, it may take longer to see progress. Choose the approach that best fits your financial personality and needs. The main thing is sticking to the repayment plan until you're debt-free. Life happens. You never know when you'll be hit with unexpected home repairs, job losses, or health issues. Having accessible cash reserves prevents resorting to high-interest debt when surprises hit. Most experts advise stockpiling enough emergency savings to cover three to six months' worth of living expenses. And whenever funds are low or living expenses increase, the savings target should shift to replenishment. Set up automatic monthly transfers to hit the target amount in an Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured account, preferably a high-yield savings account that you can easily tap. Once you meet your emergency savings target, redirect automated flows toward investing instead. Your most valuable financial asset remains human capital. Your ability to earn over your working years through high-income skills can make financial independence even easier to achieve. Pursue education (even financial and investing education), as well as consulting or freelancing opportunities that allow you to boost your income on your terms. Carving out time for professional development keeps your skillset marketable, even if you never choose to work again. As you expand skills and connections, create diversified income channels versus relying solely on salaries and wages: Mixing multiple income sources protects against disruption and risk while compounding overall cash flow. Big wins also come from the cost side of your cash flow equation. Small cost savings add up. The Watermans believe in frugality, not because they\u2019re penny pinchers but because they are intentional about what they pay for. \u201cYou can be very ruthless \u2026 don't spend money if it's not important to you,\u201d says Brock Waterman. Ask yourself if every expenditure moves you toward independence goals and greater life satisfaction. Does buying another pair of shoes bring lasting value? Or does a trip create deeper connections? It's helpful to ask yourself, \"What will this purchase contribute to my life?\" before buying. For the Watermans, traveling isn\u2019t a luxury. It\u2019s part of their financial independence plan. Traveling to low-cost-of-living areas means they spend money on memorable adventures while world-schooling their kids. Intentional spending aligns with the deeper \u201cwhy\u201d and prevents lifestyle creep from diluting bigger life plans. Reaching financial independence requires lifelong learning and growth. Mastering money mechanics, investing nuances, and tax optimization strategies greatly accelerate your outcomes over decades. Read personal finance books, listen to financial independence podcasts, attend investment seminars, and join money-minded online communities. Surround yourself with like-minded people who will teach you new, useful skillsets, rather than discourage you from reaching for your goals. Also, work with a financial advisor\u2014a fiduciary who crafts a holistic plan for you. Their expertise navigates optimized outcomes not possible alone. Investment pros protect wealth too \u2014steering you away from emotional decision pitfalls novice investors succumb to. Timelines vary substantially based on factors like income, frugality, market returns, inheritance windfalls, etc. However, truly achieving FI generally takes decades for the average person. The key is avoiding short-term scorekeeping and instead focusing on the right money mindsets and behaviors consistency over long time horizons. Marathon mentality perseveres. Absolutely! Children do reduce the free cash flow available to invest and delay retirement timelines. However, by sticking to financial independence principles and adjusting savings rates accordingly, parenthood and financial freedom can thrive together. The key is balancing enjoying special moments with kids today while also sacrificing to fund their futures responsibly. Delayed life milestones like buying a bigger home may be needed but compound investing makes larger catch-up contributions later possible too. Pursuing financial independence often requires trade-offs and sacrifices that partners may not embrace or understand initially. Try framing benefits in terms of how achieving FI together unlocks greater family time and potential. Start where you agree\u2014identify shared dreams, areas of financial stress, and lifestyle upgrades you both want. Pursue small joint money wins together first before tackling bigger mindset shifts. Leading by example also influences over time. Job loss, health care issues, and market downturns happen. Life's hiccups test financial discipline and scrappy resilience. Having emergency savings, insurance protections and diverse income streams helps weather storms without surrendering long-term financial independence aims. Remember, obstacles are inevitable. Progress over perfect financial steps moves you forward despite setbacks. It's wise to take taxes into account but avoiding investing simply due to tax considerations means leaving substantial wealth unrealized. Focus first on maximizing returns through prudent investing based on risk, fees, diversification, etc. Once assets grow, work with a financial advisor to legally minimize taxes where possible\u2014contributing to retirement accounts, realizing losses, gifting appreciated assets, etc. Reducing taxes sustains more compound capital working toward your financial independence. The first step to achieving financial independence is defining what it means for you. True independence requires a shift to intentional money mindsets and habits over time. There\u2019s more than one way to do this. \u201cI think it's important for folks to work toward multiple financial goals at once,\u201d advises Konte.\u00a0\u201cIn my opinion, retirement investing should be a nonnegotiable that we are always working toward regardless of our other financial goals. The amount will vary depending on your cash flow needs, but we should always try to do both.\u201d Russell reiterates that \u201cwhile a high income can expedite\u00a0financial\u00a0independence, it's not a\u00a0prerequisite.\u201d Smart and consistent money management, even with the assistance of a skilled team of advisors, can unlock financial independence for some families. Each money milestone compounds into greater agency to determine how you spend your time. Financial independence tends to deliver time and geographic independence too, which offers value well beyond dollars and cents.

            "title": "Financial Advisors\u2019 Advice for Millennials",
            "content": "Many millennials, born in the years 1981 to 1996, entered the workforce right on the cusp of the Great Recession. The unsteady first working years, the high average student loan balances, and the disappearance of defined benefit plans (or pensions) mean millennials have been fighting an uphill battle most of their working lives. Still, many financial advisors are impressed with millennials and how they have prioritized their finances, and for good reason. The digital native generation is also tech-savvy when it comes to figuring out the best ways to save for their futures. But even the most dedicated saver can use expert advice on juggling competing financial priorities. We asked top financial advisors for their insight for millennials who want to get the most out of their money. Avocado toast and craft coffees aren\u2019t making planning for their financial future hard for millennials. Millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers earned at the same age. Arguably, millennials have gotten the fuzzy end of the lollipop regarding their financial health. Still, according to financial advisors like Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth, millennials use the past to fuel their financial futures. Boneparth \u201cthinks the trauma of the Great Recession has made millennials very aware of savings and emergency funds,\u201d which creates a stronger foundation that allows them to be in the accumulation phase during their higher earning years. Melissa Joy, certified financial planner (CFP) and certified divorce financial analyst (CDFA), agrees. She says, \u201cMillennials are responsible for their money and making great choices.\u201d Joy is particularly encouraged by how comfortably millennials navigate retirement through company programs. Joy also finds in her practice that once millennials feel they have a handle on balancing their debt, earnings, and current savings, they seek information about the next steps. Even for millennials with no prior savings or plans for the future, all is not lost. Joy says, \u201cIf you feel like you are behind, now is such a good time to get to investing. Now, you are entering your high-earning years. There is no better time than the present to use your human capital to improve your picture.\u201d All the financial advisors interviewed in this article agreed that having emergency savings is the foundation of a sound financial plan. Life happens, and Joy emphasizes that the security of an emergency savings account can help millennials stick to their goals. Sure, millennials could skip the emergency fund and instead invest that money. However, the average credit card interest rate for users with a balance is 22.75% as of November 2023.\u00a0Even the best investment will have a hard time outpacing 22.75% interest. Individuals without emergency savings are more likely to use credit cards or debt to cover emergency costs. Boneparth sums up the importance of emergency savings by saying, \u201cGive yourself the opportunity to feel safe and secure before you even start investing. Starting early is important, but what good is compounding if you can\u2019t stay invested? This way, you can navigate the ups and downs of life without having to worry. The ability to navigate that and stay on your path separates good and bad investors.\u201d Millennials who are most successful in planning their financial futures have clear priorities, say financial advisors. \u201cYou cannot have everything you want, so what is the most important thing to you? You need to list it out and really prioritize it,\u201d says Thomas Kopelman, co-founder and financial planner at AllStreet Wealth. \u201cAlso, do the opposite. Make a list of things that you can cut.\u201d Many people think investing and planning for the future is just about dollars and cents, but financial advisors know that many money moves are psychological. By clearly establishing priorities and knowing \u201cwhat it is that you are truly after,\u201d Boneparth says, your goals will motivate you to keep going. Millennials struggling to figure out what is most important can talk to a financial advisor about prioritizing their goals. Millennials earn $8 for every $10 that the boomers earned. With that in mind, Nathaniel Hoskin, CFP, accredited wealth management advisor (AWMA), and founder and lead advisor at Hoskin Capital, recommends \u201cgiving every dollar a job.\u201d The best way to do that is to create a realistic budget. Budgeting is a critical part of a financial plan, and while there are as many different ways to budget as there are stars in the sky, the most important part of budgeting is seeing where your money is going. Financial advisors know this is an uncomfortable truth for many millennials and that the further we get away from tangible money, the easier it is to ignore. In fact, 65% of people do not know how much money they spent last month. Boneparth echoes that he has seen this in his practice and encourages millennials to be honest about their budgets by budgeting \u201cnot based on what you think you are spending but what you know you are spending.\u201d To face budgeting woes head-on, some financial advisors, like Hoskin, recommend that millennials look at their spending for the three months before they lay out a budget for future expenditures. Hoskin recommends smartphone apps as a quick way to see income vs. expenses for the three prior months without having to backtrack every expense with pencil and paper. Budgeting will reveal either a surplus or a deficit for millennials. Once millennials know where their money is going, \u201ceven if their money is not spreading as far as they want it to,\u201d they can focus on reverse budgeting, says Hoskin. Reverse budgeting means putting money aside for your future self first. Kopelman agrees wholeheartedly with Hoskin on reverse budgeting. Hoskin further recommends that millennials take advantage of automated investing and savings. He sees automation as tricking your brain and nervous system into sticking to the strategies. Setting money aside for your future self first by automatic withdrawals or transfers means you are working toward your goals before any of your income is spent. Budgeting is not a set-it-and-forget-it endeavor. Millennials should continue to track their budget and adjust goals as their priorities and income change. An easy place to continually track your budget is with a calculator. \u201cThe best we can do is our best,\u201d says Colin Overweg, CFP, founder of Advize Wealth Management. \u201cWe cannot predict the future, so we will put together a plan, stick to it, and adjust accordingly.\u201d Another way millennials can slay their financial futures is to make sure that they take advantage of all the \u201cfree money\u201d offered by their employers. We know that an overwhelming percentage of millennials are participating in employer-sponsored retirement plans, and they should pat themselves on the back for that. Participating is the first step; taking advantage of employer matching is the next logical step. Hoskin says this should be the watermark for millennials with few extra means. Leaving matching contributions on the table is like walking away from free money. Once millennials have established emergency savings and taken advantage of all matching employer contributions, financial advisors recommend working toward tackling those financial goals and priorities based on their budgets. There are some universally accepted future-focused budgeting tactics, like the 50/30/20 budget rule, where 50% of income is spent on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings. While the 50/30/20 rule is simple, financial advisors tend to agree that saving 20% of income is a solid target, but 15% is a great starting point. Those incapable of saving 20% of their income today should ideally save no less than 10% and incrementally increase it. Joy calls this \u201cmatching your lifestyle creep with your savings creep.\u201d Managing the lifestyle creep is where a financial advisor can come in handy as well, because they can help millennials continually reassess the percentage of gross income they\u2019re investing. Financial advisors want their clients to invest based on their priorities, but they also emphasize the importance of Roth individual retirement accounts (Roth IRAs) for those who qualify. Roth IRAs are accounts in which millennials can invest after-tax dollars. That is beneficial because millennials who wait to withdraw this money until after they are 59\u00bd years old can withdraw this money and its growth tax-free. If you\u2019re a millennial with your eyes on retirement, there are more resources here to help support your financial future. The most popular source for millennials to get financial advice is social media. Many advisors today exist in the social media space and practice radical generosity with their knowledge and expertise. However, as with anything, only some on the internet are experts. Millennials should approach some free financial literacy with the same caution that they might approach an unusual, spam-like social media direct message. Millennials investing in company-sponsored plans need to talk with their plan provider to ensure that their money works for them by being invested appropriately for their target retirement date and risk tolerance. Plan providers can discuss this with millennials, but millennials can also address this with financial advisors as part of their overall picture. Joy also encourages millennials to talk with someone if they have stock options as part of their overall compensation. She has seen ill-prepared millennials make very reactive decisions regarding their stock options. She says planning can make these stock options more integrated into millennials\u2019 financial plans. According to a survey from the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, most millennials get financial advice from a family member (31%), a website (27%), a trusted friend (26%), a parent (26%), a financial advisor (21%), or social media (20%). Thirty-four percent of millennials and Gen Z respondents said that lack of financial guidance was hurting their ability to manage their retirement plans. Millennials who are eligible are doing an excellent job of participating in their employer-sponsored plans. Millennials also leverage technology to help them invest in vehicles of their choice. A quick calculation to determine how much money millennials need to save for retirement is known as the 4% rule.\u00a0Millennials should estimate how much money they would like in retirement per year and divide that amount by 0.04.\u00a0This number assumes a 30-year life span and a 5% rate of return. Millennials are DIY-ing their financial future more than any generation before them, but financial advisors agree they\u2019re doing an OK job. Still, millennials who desire the best outcomes should prioritize goals and budgeting, take advantage of \u201cfree money\u201d from their employer, make a savings plan, and stick to it.

            "title": "Average Savings by Age",
            "content": "The longer you\u2019ve lived, the more likely you are to have more in savings Everyone knows it\u2019s important to save, but in a world where that\u2019s so difficult\u2014especially for people living paycheck to paycheck\u2014how can you tell what\u2019s enough? One way to gauge your progress is by comparing yourself to your peers. If you have less than the average savings for your age range, this could be a sign that you\u2019re not allocating your paycheck optimally. While there may be times when you can\u2019t save, here\u2019s what to know about the best ways to do it. Savings broadly refers to any money that a person retains from their paycheck after consumer spending, including individual or household expenses and obligations. This surplus can be put toward any number of life goals. Although savings can be further grown through investing, this would entail putting the money at risk of loss. As such, the use of the term \u201csavings\u201d in this article will generally refer to cash or cash equivalents (i.e., deposits in a bank or credit union) that offer low returns but are almost entirely safe from loss (except due to inflation). Money kept within a financial institution is typically deposited into one or more deposit accounts, including but not limited to savings accounts, checking accounts, and money market accounts (MMAs), each of which has its own advantages and limitations. Keep in mind that, even though there is a deposit account with \u201csavings\u201d in the name, money stored in any kind of bank account can still be considered savings. Savings accounts are also known by the name \u201ctransaction accounts\u201d by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Transaction accounts include checking, savings, and MMAs; money market funds (MMFs); call or cash accounts at brokerages; and prepaid debit cards. They do not include retirement accounts, as these are considered a separate category. In some cases, a person\u2019s bank account(s) will accrue interest on their savings, causing their balance(s) to slowly grow\u2014\u201cslowly\u201d being the operative word here, as the amount of return is often so minuscule that little change will be seen even over a substantial length of time. Even higher-interest savings accounts don\u2019t pay as much as other types of investments. As such, if an individual wishes to grow their savings for a long-term goal like retirement, they will not just have to regularly allocate a portion of their income specifically for savings but eventually allocate a portion of their savings to higher-earning but riskier investment products. Retirement accounts differ from standard deposit accounts in that they generally come with tax advantages intended to promote saving for retirement. As such, withdrawing funds from some retirement accounts may result in a withdrawal penalty if done prior to the end of an early withdrawal period. Of course, at the onset of their career paths, people (at least those with little to no generational wealth) will start out with little in the way of savings, particularly those with low-paying entry-level jobs. As an individual gets older and moves up in the working world, they should be earning more, allowing their savings to grow\u2014ideally peaking as their retirement nears. After leaving the working world, savings will start to decrease as people spend more than they receive in retirement income. That\u2019s the theory. How do people\u2019s savings patterns work out in real life? Below are the six age groups used by the Federal Reserve Board to measure mean transaction account balances by age, as part of the organization\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances. Although this data doesn\u2019t capture the savings data of every single person in the United States, it functions as a representative sample that helps highlight financial trends that can help economists assess needs and individuals evaluate where they stand compared with peers. Additionally, two age groups\u2014Less Than 35 and 45\u201354\u2014reported all-time-high savings in 2019. The good news: The percentage of respondents with transaction accounts has been trending upward over time. When the survey was first conducted in 1989, most age groups reported figures from 85% to 91%. The only exception was the Less Than 35 category, which was a little more than 5% below the next-lowest age group. However, this gap would close by 2016, with this also being the only year when the Less Than 35 age group had a higher percentage than another category. The remaining five groups would rise and fall until 2013, after which all six spiked in 2016 and then leveled out. The 75 or Older category has typically held the highest or second-highest percentage of transaction account holders, aside from a notable drop in 1998. As of 2019, all six groups were above 97%. Exactly how much money one should squirrel away in savings is a tricky question, as everyone\u2019s financial circumstances are different. While few people would balk at the idea of having too much in savings, the best choices are more complex. It\u2019s inadvisable to keep more than the $250,000 amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) in any one insured bank in case it fails. And, at a certain point, excess funds could be better put to use outside of low-interest deposit accounts. When building your savings, the first priority is to ensure that you\u2019re setting aside enough for an emergency fund. In the event that you should lose your job, rack up a large hospital bill, or need to finance a major repair for your car or house, having enough set aside can help you stay afloat. Of course, how much you need in your emergency fund is also variable, as people with different lifestyles, debts, and dependents will naturally need different amounts to recover from a crisis. After accounting for your emergency fund and your regular expenses, the smartest thing to do with any money that might be left over is putting it toward investments that can help you further grow your wealth, including investment vehicles like a house. While retirement is typically the ultimate savings goal for most people, thinking of \u201csavings\u201d and \u201cretirement savings\u201d as two separate things is a good mindset to have. After all, since your collective savings can be spent at any time, it\u2019s harder to think of them as being intended for a specific, far-off purpose (which can unintentionally cause you to spend money that you might need in the future without realizing it). Similarly, since money can\u2019t be retrieved from most retirement accounts before the end of an early withdrawal period without incurring withdrawal penalties, it isn\u2019t as liquid as savings traditionally are. Plus, it\u2019s generally a good idea to still have money in savings once you\u2019ve retired, as invested retirement assets are more subject to market volatility. In a bad market year, it\u2019s good to have cash to avoid liquidating too many equities at an unfortunate time. According to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances, the mean transaction account balance for all households in 2019 was $41,600. Savings accounts allow you to save money for both short- and long-term goals, the latter of which can include retirement. As the name would suggest, retirement accounts are generally intended as a way to save for retirement. While it is possible to use funds from these accounts for other purposes, many will impose an early withdrawal penalty. The 50/30/20 budget rule is a plan for dividing after-tax income to help people reach their financial goals, with 50% being spent on needs, 30% spent on wants, and 20% put into savings. The main takeaway from the Federal Reserve data is that it\u2019s crucial to start saving as soon as possible. No matter what age you are, it\u2019s never too late to begin saving; you may just have to work quickly to make up for lost time. As such, it also might be worth it to consider cutting unnecessary expenses, finding a means of earning additional income, and researching potential retirement accounts to find one that best suits your needs.

            "title": "What Is Personal Finance Management (PFM), How Is It Used?",
            "content": "Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. While the moniker \u201cpersonal financial management\u201d is often used to refer to ways of managing your personal finances, it is also an actual term often known by its acronym, PFM, and refers to the type of software used for personal finance apps. PFM has been around since 1983 when Intuit co-founder Scott Cook grew tired of watching his wife struggle with all the paperwork involved in paying bills by hand. He started to explore how to simplify, or automate, the process. On his way to hang a notice seeking a programmer at Stanford University, he fortuitously ran into Tom Proulx, who had done some programming and agreed to write a simple check-balancing program for Cook that became an early version of the personal finance software program Quicken. And that\u2019s how Intuit (INTU) was born. The company started by building out Quicken, but it was a crowded field. Cook and Proulx weren\u2019t the only ones seeking a solution to the frustration of juggling all that bill-paying paperwork. When Quicken launched, there were already 46 other personal finance products out there, but many were clunky and not easy to use. Quicken\u2019s biggest selling point was its ease of use. Because it literally mimicked a paper check, the software became widely accessible to anyone who ever had to pay a bill by check. What finally pushed Quicken to the front of the pack was a combination of positive reviews of its Apple version, a direct marketing approach, and stellar customer service. Creating a software product that mimicked a hard-copy product allowed Quicken to draw in customers, and tuning into other ways that customers were using the product allowed it to keep evolving. That was a critical key to its success. For example, once the company found that a third of its customers were using the software for business expenses, Intuit pushed out what has become today\u2019s Quickbooks\u2014a version of Quicken that focuses on tracking those expenses. It also created a feature that allowed customers to download their brokerage statements and incorporate them into financial planning. That set the stage for other PFM products to become part of a growing abundance of personal finance tools available today. They include ones focused on tracking credit scores (think Credit Karma), ones that allow individual investors to trade for their own account (think Robinhood), and ones focused on tracking spending and bill paying (think Prism). PFM is the software that powers these apps, as well as many mobile banking tools. Quickbooks integrates with TurboTax, allowing those who are self-employed to import their financial information to file their taxes. Banking and finance apps may share PFM software, but they are not all built the same. It\u2019s important to define what your needs are to ensure that you are using the right system. Some of these apps have free versions, although many have subscriptions to access more advanced features. Some are built for Windows, some are built for Macs, and some live in the cloud. While mobile banking can help with bill paying, tracking deposits/withdrawals, and transferring funds between accounts, personal finance apps are often built with more comprehensive money management tools and a greater ability to personalize features. Many not only allow you to pay bills and track deposits/withdrawals but also include broader options that give you the flexibility to take more control of your financial management goals. Personal finance apps have evolved to become much more user friendly and targeted to customers\u2019 needs. Overall, these apps will allow you to be more organized with your finances. At the simplest level, they will help you track your budget/spending and ensure that you pay your bills on time. If you have broader needs, then there are most likely apps for them, too\u2014or soon will be. This list is by no means exhaustive, but it provides an overview of the top seven personal finance apps as ranked by Investopedia sister site The Balance.

Narayanan, the Thomas D. Casserly, Jr. Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. It\u2019s fully online, and there is no live instruction. Harvard offers Financial Accounting at specific times throughout the year, so check the application deadlines and program dates. This course is relatively expensive and you\u2019ll learn a lot more than simple bookkeeping, so it\u2019s not right for everyone. But if you\u2019re serious about developing the skills needed to work with finance and want to leave no stone unturned, it could be worth the investment.

A college-level course, like one offered through Coursera or the Harvard Business School, could be a good choice if you're more serious and want to take your skills to the next level. The basic skills needed to be an effective bookkeeper include knowledge of math, being tech-savvy, and paying close attention to details, as you will be surrounded by numbers and financial reports all day long. Generally, employers are looking for someone with strong data entry skills who can keep their financial records in order, document all of their key transactions, and manage invoices. A bookkeeping class gives you an overview of the primary functions and concepts of bookkeeping, such as financial statements and journal entries, as well as how to record expenses, profits, revenues, losses, and much more. Some also cover how to use popular bookkeeping software and may even offer certifications upon course completion. The level of detail and length of the course will depend on whether it's designed for someone looking to launch a career or simply keep better track of their small business finances. While most companies do not require a certification to be a bookkeeper, it does help if you want to launch a career in the accounting industry and would like to be considered for high-income opportunities. Getting your bookkeeping certification with one of the two main nationally recognized certifying bodies, either the National Association of Certified Bookkeepers or the American Institute of Professional Bookkeepers, is a good way to demonstrate your expertise and qualifications.

The classes listed here start off as low as $0 if you enroll in an online learning platform with a free trial or free course materials. Alternatively, if you choose to enroll in a class with a traditional educational institution, such as a college or university, the cost can exceed $1,000. We know how important it is to find reliable online classes, so we researched more than 30 different sites offering online bookkeeping classes, from educational institutions to online learning platforms. We considered the reputations of the institutions offering the courses as well as those of the instructors. We also examined the types and costs of class materials, the availability of in-person support, and the success rates of students.

Learn what compound interest is and how to open an account that offers it Albert Einstein once described compound interest as the eighth wonder of the world. Compound interest is what you earn from the combined amount of interest paid on your savings and the savings themselves. This then allows a greater amount of savings to grow even more, especially in high-yield saving accounts. In other words, you earn interest on your interest. As you build your savings with past interest payments, you receive a higher return each subsequent year. This is thanks to exponential growth from compounding. You don\u2019t have to be a Nobel Prize winner like Einstein to benefit from the power of compounding. Here\u2019s how to open a compound interest account and what you should research before signing up. Investopedia / Zoe Hansen A compound interest account is any account that pays you interest on your principal and interest, and not simply on your original deposit. Such an account might be a savings account that you open at a bank or a brokerage account that you open with an online or full service broker. Each company has its specific process for how to open an account that offers compound interest. Here is a general overview of how this works and what you should consider as you compare your options. Step 1: Determine the type of compound interest account you need. Start by deciding what type of compound interest account you\u2019d like. Do you want to earn a guaranteed return where you can\u2019t lose money? If so, your best choice may be a bank offering high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs). Or, would you like to invest for a higher compounding rate, even if there\u2019s a risk of short-term losses? In this case, open a brokerage account and invest in bonds, mutual funds, REITs, and stocks. You may find a company that gives you a combination of both of the above choices. For example, with a Fidelity account, you can invest in the market and receive a guaranteed interest rate payment on your uninvested cash. Step 2: Compare costs, fees, and incentives. Each compound interest account has its own set of costs and fees. Some of these fees are: The more you pay in fees, the more your return is reduced, and the less you earn overall. The best compound interest accounts keep fees as low as possible. Look for companies that also offer incentives when you open a new compound interest account. For example, some may offer you up to a $200 bonus for opening a new savings account. Check for these as well as low fees to jump start your savings growth. Step 3: Compare services. The services offered by financial institutions can vary. Consider the following and decide what's important to you. Step 4: Sign up for an account. Once you\u2019ve decided where to open your compound interest account, you can formally sign up. You must provide your personal contact information, employment information, and tax ID number\u2014usually your Social Security number. The institution needs to verify your identity to meet government regulations. How long the application process takes depends on the type of account. You could potentially open and qualify for a bank account within an hour. Brokerage investment accounts can take as long as several days, as the broker must review your application and financial information. Step 5: Fund your account. Last, link your current bank account to the compound interest account so you can transfer money in. Once you\u2019ve set up the account along with any investments, you\u2019ll start growing your savings with compound interest. If you have uninvested cash and want to keep it that way, you can still make it work for you by putting it in a liquid interest-bearing account. See the section \"Investment Platforms That Handle Uninvested Cash\" below. As indicated above, you must submit a variety of personal and financial information to open a compound interest account. Financial institutions need this information to report your tax earnings and to meet other government regulations (concerning, for example, anti-money laundering). So expect to provide the following: If you\u2019d like to earn compound interest by investing, you must provide more financial information beyond that required by a basic bank account. The broker needs this information to determine which investment options and strategies are appropriate for you. You may need to provide the following: Uninvested cash is cash that you haven't yet used to purchase investments. In fact, many savers keep a certain amount of uninvested cash available for liquidity purposes and as part of their diversification plan. Here are some well-known platforms that can help make your uninvested cash work for you, rather than sit idly in an account. Again, if you\u2019d like to start earning compound interest, you need to decide on the type of account you'll open. There\u2019s a broad range of compound interest accounts, with lower to higher risk. Below are the more basic, safer compound interest accounts and what they involve. High-yield savings accounts are bank accounts paying a high interest rate. The best high-yield savings accounts pay a competitive return with very low fees. Most are free. You can\u2019t lose money in a savings account (especially if it's FDIC-insured), and savings accounts give you convenient access to your funds at any time. If you\u2019d like to learn more about high yielding compound savings interest accounts, see our roundup of the best high-yield savings account rates. Money market accounts are another bank deposit account. They typically have a higher minimum balance requirement than high-yield savings accounts. Otherwise, you may owe a monthly fee. In exchange, money market accounts usually pay a higher interest rate than savings accounts. So if you\u2019re willing to deposit more money, you can earn more compound interest using a money market account. These accounts have a guaranteed return and you cannot lose money. You can also withdraw funds whenever you want. When you sign up for a CD, you select the term (the time period for the investment). It could range from a month to many years. During this time, you earn a guaranteed compound interest rate. Your balance is also insured, so it won\u2019t drop. However, you will owe a penalty if you want your money back before the end of the agreed upon term. If you take money out early, you could forfeit interest earnings and even some of your deposit. CDs typically pay a higher interest rate than other bank deposit products in exchange for giving you less access to your money. With a bond, you\u2019re lending money to a government, company, or other organization for a set period of time. During this period, you receive interest payments. Typically, you get your principal (the amount you invested) back at the end of the bond term. Bonds have more risk and take more research than bank deposit accounts. First, you must check how safe a bond is by reviewing the issuer\u2019s credit rating. If a bond issuer runs into financial trouble, it might not pay all the interest it owes you or even fail to pay your deposit back. For safer bond investments, consider bonds from issuers like the U.S. government or very large, established companies. Bond rating agencies give letter grades to show the financial stability of different bond issuers. If you want your money back before the end of the bond term, you could sell your bond to another investor through your investment platform. However, you might get back less than you paid. This happens if interest rates have increased since you first bought the bond. If you don\u2019t want to put in the research and work yourself, another option is to buy a bond fund. A professional investor builds a portfolio of different bonds and passes on compound interest to investors in the fund. Mutual funds combine the money of many small investors to create a large investment portfolio. A professional investor manages the portfolio and decides on the investments. Mutual funds have different investment objectives. For example, an income mutual fund focuses on generating income via bonds and other fixed income investments. A growth mutual fund focuses on higher-risk but potentially higher-earning investments like stocks. There is more risk with mutual funds than with other low-risk compound interest accounts. A fund's investments may not work out, and your account balance could fall. However, mutual funds have higher earning potential than bank accounts. If you\u2019re investing for the long term, you could potentially earn more compound interest using mutual funds. These compound interest investments can earn more than the basic options. But, be warned, they also require more research and you have a higher risk of losing money. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are funds that invest in real estate. You pool your money with many other investors. Then, the REIT uses this money to invest in various properties. You earn a share of the profits from rent and property sales. REITs are a way to make compound interest from real estate without going through the work and great expense of buying your own properties. Many REITs are publicly traded so you can sell to another investor and cash out at your convenience. However, non-traded REITs lock you in potentially for years. With bonds, generally, the riskier the investment, the higher the interest rate that it offers investor. High-yield bonds, or junk bonds, are supposed to pay an attractive, higher coupon rate. As a result, you can earn more in compound interest. However, high-yield bonds have an increased risk of default (hence the moniker \"junk\" bonds). As a result, you might only get some of the interest payments. If the issuer goes bankrupt, you may also lose your initial investment. High-yield bonds are those with a Standard & Poor\u2019s credit rating of BB+ or worse. Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are a type of digital currency. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and not managed by any government. If you invest in cryptocurrencies, you could make money if the price goes up. Some cryptocurrencies also use a system called staking. If you own the cryptocurrency, you could agree to lock it up temporarily and earn an interest return paid in more cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are another very high-risk, potentially high-reward investment. Companies issue stock to raise money. When you buy stocks, you become a part owner of a company and could share in future profits. When a company makes money, it can either reinvest it to continue growing or pay out earnings to shareholders through a dividend payment. Dividend stocks come from companies that regularly pay dividends. These are usually larger, more established, profitable companies. Smaller companies and those trying to grow are less likely to pay dividends. If you want compound interest from dividend stocks, research the past dividend rate of each company that interests you. Confirm as much as possible that a company can remain profitable so it will keep paying dividends. For investment ideas, check out these top dividend stocks. If you don\u2019t want to do this work yourself, you could look for a mutual fund focused on companies that pay dividends. Alternative investments are those outside the conventional financial markets. These could include hedge funds, private equity funds, commodities, artwork, and farmland. Alternative investments are higher risk and require more research. For some, like hedge funds, you are required to be an accredited investor. In exchange, these investments could earn high returns. Predicting your compound interest earnings lets you see whether you\u2019re on track for your goals. Some of the factors that determine how much you\u2019ll earn include: As the saying goes, it takes money to make money. Therefore, the more you deposit into a compound interest account, the more you earn annually. This, along with starting to save with compound interest accounts as early in your life as possible, is the foundation of successful interest compounding. As you build your savings from the compound interest, you will make more and more per year. An account interest rate indicates how much you will earn per year on your balance. When researching how to open a compound interest account, look for one offering a competitive rate. You should also keep an eye on market and economic changes. Rates can change, which could increase or decrease how much interest you earn per year. You should also check regularly to see if you could get a better deal from another company. Compounding frequency relates to how quickly your account starts earning interest on prior earnings. Accounts could compound annually, quarterly, monthly, and even daily. The more frequent the compounding schedule, the more interest you earn per year. This is because the account starts paying a return on your past earnings sooner. If you\u2019re interested in a daily compound interest account, our review of the best CD rates may help. If your compound interest account charges fees, they will be deducted from your balance. The more you pay out in fees, the less an account balance you'll have for compounding. Therefore, look for accounts with low or no fees. Compound interest is interest that you earn on past interest/investment earnings. For example, you put $10,000 in a savings account, paying 5% yearly. After one year, you earn $500 and have $10,500 in savings. Your second year of earnings will be $525. You earn more because you\u2019re making a return both on your initial deposit as well as past earnings. Over time, your savings grow, and you earn more and more money through compound interest. Compound interest works by growing your money through a bank or investment account. You first put your money into a compound interest account. It indicates how much you will earn per year. Your balance then grows by this compound interest amount. The following year, your balance plus interest earnings will continue to grow by the return. Compound interest works exponentially because you earn more and more as your savings grow. Savers and investors benefit from compound interest. As you build your account balance, you earn more each year, thanks to compounding. On the other hand, compound interest hurts people in debt. If you owe interest on an account balance, as with a credit card account, the amount of interest gets added to your outstanding balance each period. So the more you owe, the more you\u2019ll be charged in interest each year, increasing the amount that you need to pay back to the creditor. Many compound interest accounts are considered safe, such as high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs. Banks guarantee your return and you do not face market losses in these accounts. Safer compound interest accounts tend to pay a lower interest rate than riskier accounts, however. If you want to earn more, you could put your money into investments with greater risk, from mutual funds to stocks to REITs. If the investment does well over time, you can earn more yearly with compound interest. However, you also face a greater risk of losing money. Compound interest for one year is calculated by multiplying your starting amount by one plus the interest rate. If you have $1,000 and earn 5%, your growth with compound interest equals $1,000 x (1 + 5%) = $1,000 x 1.05 = $1,050. For multiple years, use this formula: starting principal x (1 + interest)^n, where n equals the number of years. In this same example, your $1,000 would turn into $1,276.28 over five years. This formula works with annual compounding. If you compound more frequently, it gets more complicated. You could use an online compound interest calculator to determine how much you will earn over time. Compound interest can play a crucial role in the growth of your savings and wealth over time. The earlier you start taking advantage of compound interest, the more time it has to transform your account balances. So consider it a top financial priority to research and open a compound interest account.

            "content": "Start right now. The younger you are, the more your savings can grow. Amy Fontinelle has more than 15 years of experience covering personal finance, corporate finance and investing. Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. recep-bg / Getty Images In 2024, 35 U.S. states required a personal finance course and 28 required an economics course for high school graduation, up from 23 and 25, respectively, in 2022. While these numbers represent progress, there are still knowledge gaps for young adults to learn how to manage money, apply for credit, and stay out of debt. Exercise patience and self-control with your finances. If you wait and save money for what you need, you will pay with cash or a debit card to deduct money directly from your checking account and avoid using a credit card. A credit card is a loan that accumulates interest unless you can afford to pay off the balance in full every month. Credit cards can help you build a good credit score, but you should use them for emergencies only. Take charge of your financial future and read a few basic books on personal finance. Once armed with knowledge, don\u2019t let anyone take you off track, whether a significant other who encourages you to waste money or friends who plan expensive trips and events you can't afford. Research professionals like financial planners, mortgage lenders, or accountants before utilizing their services. Once you\u2019ve read a few personal finance books, you will understand two rules. Never let your expenses exceed your income, and watch where your money goes. The best way to follow these rules is by budgeting and creating a personal spending plan to track the money coming in and going out through budgeting apps. Tracking expenses, like your expensive morning coffee, can provide a valuable wake-up call. Small changes in your everyday expenses are under your control and can impact your financial situation. Keeping monthly expenses, like rent, as low as possible can save you money over time and put you in a position to invest in your own home sooner rather than later. A mantra in personal finance is \u201cpay yourself first,\u201d which means saving money for emergencies and your future. This simple practice can keep you out of trouble financially and help you sleep better at night. Even those on the tightest budget should put some money into an emergency fund every month. Once you get into the habit of saving money, you will stop treating savings as optional and start treating it as a required monthly expense. Many accounts offer the power of compound interest, such as a high-yield savings account, a short-term certificate of deposit (CD), or a money market account. No matter how young you are, plan for your retirement now. With the power of compound interest, when you start saving in your 20s, you will earn interest not only on the principal you deposit but also on the interest you earn over time, and you will have what you need to retire someday. Company-sponsored retirement plans are a great choice. Not only do you get to put in pretax dollars, but many companies will also match part of your contribution, which is free money. Contribution limits tend to be higher for 401(k)s than for individual retirement accounts (IRAs), but both are one step closer to financial health. If you invest $200 a month, averaging a positive return of 9% annually over 40 years, you will save $856,214 for retirement. When a company offers you a starting salary, calculate whether that salary after taxes meets your financial needs and savings goals. Many online calculators help you see your after-tax salary, such as PaycheckCity.com, and chart your gross pay (total earnings) and net pay (earnings after taxes and other deductions, or take-home pay). In 2024, an annual salary of $43,000 in New York netted $34,549 after federal and state taxes; about $2,879 per month. In the U.S., low-income earners are taxed at a lower rate than higher-income earners\u2014the higher your salary, the higher the tax rate. A salary increase from $43,000 to $49,000 a year looks like an extra $6,000 per year or $500 per month, but the tax rate will be higher, so it will only give you $4,469, or $372 per month. If you\u2019re uninsured, don\u2019t wait to apply for health insurance. If employed, your employer may offer health insurance, including high-deductible health plans that save on premiums and qualify you for a Health Savings Account (HSA). If you\u2019re under the age of 26, you may be able to stay on your parent\u2019s health insurance, an option that has been allowed since the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). If you need to buy insurance, investigate the federal and state plans offered by the Health Insurance Marketplace of the ACA. Look at quotes from different insurance providers to find the lowest rates. Research all your options to see if you qualify for a subsidy based on your income. If you rent, get renter's insurance to protect the contents of your home from loss due to burglary or fire. Read the policy carefully to see what\u2019s covered and what isn\u2019t. Disability insurance protects your ability to earn an income by providing you with a steady income if you are unable to work for an extended period due to illness or injury. If you want help managing your money, find a fee-only financial planner to provide unbiased advice. Unlike a commission-based financial advisor, who earns money when you sign up with the investments their company markets, a fee-only planner can provide advice that's in your best interest. An excellent choice for a young adult is a fee-only financial planner. Unlike a commission-based advisor, who earns a commission if they sign you up with their company's investment plans, a fee-only planner has no personal incentive beyond your best interest, so they have no reason not to give you unbiased advice. Compound interest is one of the most powerful forces in finance because it grows your money exponentially, which means it can supercharge your savings over time. You earn interest on your principal and on the interest you earn. The higher your salary, the higher your tax rate. If you just got a raise or took a new job at a higher salary, the change in the marginal tax rate on the additional income will affect your paycheck. For example, if a salary increase of $6,000 per year bumps you up into a higher tax bracket, the percentage of your income that goes to taxes bumps up as well\u2014which will make your paycheck smaller than expected. You don\u2019t need an MBA in finance or specialized training to become an expert at managing your finances. By following these eight tips, you will be on the path to financial security.

Brandon is a professor of finance and financial planning. CFP, RICP, and EA, and a doctorate in finance from Hampton University. Tsuji / Getty Images Travelers should look to convert their currency before embarking on a trip or know where to go to save on changing money while abroad. Trading currency at a hotel or even a currency kiosk in an airport or elsewhere in the country can be costly due to poor exchange rates and high fees. The best options are more likely to be associated with your local bank or credit union, so it's important to plan ahead when it comes to exchanging currency. Currency exchange fees play a crucial role in the global financial landscape. These fees are the charges applied by financial institutions or currency exchange services for converting one currency to another. Financial institutions that provide currency exchange services take on the risk of price fluctuations; if they hold one currency and it goes down in value, they theoretically need to be compensated for holding this currency. Behind the scenes of a currency exchange transaction, there are significant operational costs as well. Banks have to keep up with maintaining the necessary infrastructure and technology. Financial institutions also need to invest in secure and efficient systems to ensure they're using accurate exchange rates. Exchange fees help cover these operational costs. Last, financial institutions are profit-driven entities. Banks and similar entities are in the business to make money. Offering currency exchange services is one way they generate revenue. While competition in the market helps keep fees competitive, financial institutions still need to generate sufficient income to remain sustainable and one way they do this is by charging fees for certain services. With the context of why fees occur behind us, let's start digging into how to avoid fees. You can begin by finding out what a fair exchange rate is for the country or countries you'll be visiting. Check key currency exchange websites first. The following are some of the best and least expensive places to convert currency: Ordering cash online will likely include delivery charges, and the exchange rate won\u2019t be as good as with your bank; however, this is still a better option when compared with the must-avoid options below. The best option for exchanging currency and saving fees is to use a foreign ATM or your own bank's ATMs overseas, if possible. Piggybacking on the suggestion above, if you don\u2019t have time to get the foreign currency before leaving or don\u2019t want to carry a lot of cash, check to see if your bank has ATMs in the destination country or its cities. It may even have banking affiliates there. A key tip is to use an ATM within the airport as soon as you arrive. When you\u2019re back in the U.S., head to your bank or credit union to transfer any leftover foreign currency to U.S. dollars. It's important to note that some banks will not take foreign currency. As a last resort, if you have foreign currency left over before you depart the country you're visiting, look to convert it at an airport kiosk or a store before leaving. The world has become so digital that most people no longer walk around foreign countries with traveler's checks and money belts. That\u2019s why you should take both a no-foreign-fee debit card and a no-foreign-transaction-fee credit card with you. The likes of Chase, Bank of America, Capital One, and other major credit card issuers offer specific no-foreign-transaction-fee cards. It is best to primarily use a no-transaction-fee credit card, rather than cash, on an overseas trip as it will likely offer fraud protection; use currency only as a backup. You can replace lost or stolen credit cards, but lost cash can never be replaced. However, don\u2019t use your credit card for a cash advance to receive foreign currency. Doing so means you\u2019ll get hit with a cash advance fee and a high interest rate that starts accruing immediately. The widespread use and enhancement of technology have helped make using credit and debit cards possible in most parts of the world. However, there are exceptions, so it is worth investigating whether your destination accepts debit or specific cards before you go on a trip. One thing to do before traveling abroad is to let your bank and credit card companies know of your travel plans, although some banks are moving away from encouraging this practice. That way, if you use your credit or debit card abroad, these companies won\u2019t cut off access to your account due to concerns of fraud. Also, avoid paying in U.S. dollars while outside the country when possible, even if a merchant offers to convert them for you. This includes paying with a credit or debit card. The merchant would likely convert at a rate that\u2019s disadvantageous to you and charge fees. The same goes for paying with U.S. dollars in the form of cash. Some places that you should avoid for exchanging currency are: Throughout this article, we've talked about it's best to optimize your foreign currency exchange before your trip. Even in international cities, you should avoid last-minute exchanges, and utilizing tools like limit orders or rate alerts in advance of your trip can help secure more favorable rates. Additionally, staying informed about economic events that may impact currency values allows for strategic timing. There are a few other bits of advice on timing. The currency markets operate 24 hours a day during the business week, but they usually close over the weekends. During these market closures, there is no active trading, and as a result, liquidity tends to be lower. Lower liquidity can lead to wider bid-ask spreads, making it more expensive to execute currency transactions. In addition, holidays can have a similar impact on currency markets. On public holidays, financial institutions and markets in specific countries may be closed, leading to decreased trading volumes and liquidity. This reduced liquidity can again result in wider spreads and less favorable exchange rates. Banks, credit unions, and online currency exchange bureaus and converters provide convenient and often inexpensive currency exchange services. Also, your own bank's overseas ATM or a foreign bank's are ways to get local currency with a credit card or ATM card once you have arrived. Among the worst options are trading currency at a hotel or a currency kiosk in an airport or elsewhere in the country because these can be costly due to poor exchange rates and high fees. Travelers can rely solely on their credit cards for purchases, if accepted everywhere in a country being visited. It's also still an option to bring traveler's checks, although these mostly have been supplanted by the widespread use of credit cards today. You can also choose to spend U.S. dollars in some instances while overseas, but this practice isn't recommended because the exchange rate given in a foreign country is often disadvantageous to the purchaser. When you\u2019re back home, you can go to your bank or credit union to transfer any leftover foreign currency into your own country's currency. Be aware that some banks will not take all foreign currencies. As a last resort, if you have foreign currency left over before you depart the country you're visiting, look to convert it at an airport kiosk or a store before leaving. If you do a little homework before leaving for your trip by checking exchange rates, you\u2019re likely to save. Remember to stick to ATMs and no-transfer-fee credit card spending, and avoid exchanging money at airport kiosks, hotels, and buying things with U.S. dollars to avoid costly exchange rates and fees.

Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University. Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI)\u00a0is a personal finance measure that compares the amount of debt you have to your gross income. You can calculate your debt-to-income ratio by dividing your total recurring monthly debt by your gross monthly income Why do you need to know this number? Because lenders use it as a measure of your ability to repay the money you have borrowed or to take on additional debt\u2014such as a mortgage or a car loan. It's also a helpful number for you to know as you consider whether you want to make a big purchase in the first place. This article will walk you through the steps to take to determine your debt-to-income ratio. To calculate your debt-to-income ratio, start by adding up all of your recurring monthly debts. Beyond your mortgage, other recurring debts to include are: Next, determine your gross (pre-tax) monthly income, including: Now divide your total recurring monthly debt by your gross monthly income. The quotient will be a decimal; multiply by 100 to express your debt-to-income ratio as a percentage. Your debt-to-income ratio, along with your credit score, is one of the most important factors lenders consider when you apply for a loan. If you are considering a major acquisition, you should take into account the new purchase as you work out your debt-to-income ratio. You can be sure that any lender considering your application will do so. You can use an online calculator, for example, to estimate the amount of the monthly mortgage payment or new car loan that you are considering. Comparing your \"before\" and \"after\" debt-to-income ratio is a good way to help you determine whether you can handle that home purchase or new car right now. When you pay off debt\u2014a student loan or a credit card\u2014recalculating your debt-to-income ratio shows how much you have improved your financial status. For example, in most cases, lenders prefer to see a debt-to-income ratio smaller than 36%, with no more than 28% of that debt going towards servicing your mortgage. To get a qualified mortgage, your maximum debt-to-income ratio should be no higher than 43%. Let's see how that could translate into a real-life situation. Most lenders prefer to see a debt-to-income ratio of no higher than 36%. Here's a look at an example of a debt-to-income ratio calculation. Mary has the following recurring monthly debts: Mary's total recurring monthly debt equals $2,300. She has the following gross monthly income: Mary's gross monthly income equals $6,000. Mary's debt-to-income ratio is calculated by dividing her total recurring monthly debt ($2,300) by her gross monthly income ($6,000). The math looks like this: Debt-to-income ratio = $2,300 /\u00a0$6,000 = 0.38 Now multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage: 0.38 X 100 = 38% Mary's debt-to-income ratio = 38% Less debt or a higher income would give Mary a lower, and therefore better, debt-to-income ratio. Say she manages to pay off her student and auto loans, but her income stays the same. In that case the calculation would be: Total recurring monthly debt = $1,600 Gross monthly income = $6,000 Mary's new debt-to-income ratio = $1,600 /\u00a0$6,000 = 0.27 X 100 = 27%.

He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Getty Images Are you looking to score the cheapest flight? The best time to book varies based on factors such as your destination and the timing of your trip. Generally, the day you book your ticket won\u2019t impact the price as much as the day of the week you\u2019re actually traveling. According to Expedia\u2019s 2024 Air Travel Hacks Report, 55% of Americans find air travel more daunting than filing taxes or visiting the dentist. Understanding when and how to book your flights can help reduce some stress and save you money. Let\u2019s explore strategies for scoring the best deals on airfare, no matter when you\u2019re traveling. Use fare comparison tools to monitor prices and set price alerts. Use a rewards credit card that earns miles or points and has travel benefits to help your day-of travel experience. If you\u2019re interested in getting the best deal on flights, it helps to understand what causes changes in pricing. You want to avoid booking too far in advance (more than five months), as prices can be higher. On the flip side, waiting until the last minute can result in prices doubling, especially in the weeks leading up to fly time. Using a free tool like Google Flights can help you stay on top of fare pricing trends so you can pinpoint the best time to book flights. According to Expedia\u2019s 2024 Air Travel Hacks Report, the best time to book domestic flights is about 28 days before departure, as it can save you up to 24% compared to those who book at the last minute. The travel booking app Hopper recommends travelers begin to monitor prices 3-4 months in advance and book 1-2 months ahead for optimal savings. Book international flights around 60 days in advance for the best availability and savings. Hopper recommends monitoring the price of your trip 7-8 months in advance. It\u2019s not as simple as an internet search using the term \"cheapest airlines.\" Plenty of low-cost carriers (Frontier, Spirit, Avelo, etc.) offer a cheaper ticket, but you end up paying several add-ons, including carry-on luggage, preferred seat assignment, etc.) Travel site aggregators like Kayak and Expedia may not find you a better flight deal than you\u2019ll find on an airline website. Use your due diligence. According to Google\u2019s 2024 travel trends, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are the cheapest days of the week to fly, whether it\u2019s international or domestic. Flying on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday could be up to 13% more expensive. For domestic trips, the potential savings jump to 20%. The actual time you fly also plays a part. Flights departing before 3 p.m. are statistically less likely to be canceled, and flights with a departure time after 3 p.m. face a 50% higher chance of cancellation. Expedia analyzed data from the Airlines Reporting Corporation, covering 15 billion flights from 490 airlines. The data reveals that booking domestic or international flights on Sundays instead of Fridays can save travelers an average of 8%. Traveling in January and February is often cheaper than traveling over spring break months. On average, travelers saved 30% per ticket off airfare in 2023 when traveling in the first two months of the year. If you opt to travel in the spring, prices have been lowest 44 days before departure, with the lowest price range being 33-59 days out. If you can, skip the warm, peak summer months and consider traveling in September or October. Also known as shoulder season, prices tend to fall before demand increases for the holiday season. In 2023, domestic travelers saved 32% off airfare by shifting trips from peak summer months to September or October. Tickets are generally more expensive during Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year\u2019s holidays than during the rest of the winter. Hopper suggests booking your Thanksgiving and Christmas travel by the end of October to avoid airfare selling out or a rise in prices. Use tools like Google Flights, Kayak, Expedia, or the Hopper app to track airfare and receive real-time alerts when prices drop. Google Flights will also sometimes show you when it expects prices to drop based on historical data for your selected route. Expedia\u2019s Price Drop Protection gives travelers a refund if the cost of their booked flight drops after purchase, as long as they book directly on Expedia. Travel rewards credit cards can help save you money on your trip overall. For example, you may be able to find a card that offers perks such as: These benefits may not trim money off your actual ticket cost, but they can save you on other flight-related expenses. If you want to purchase airfare with points and miles instead of cash, redemption values vary. When comparing travel rewards cards, be sure to consider whether any blackout dates or other restrictions may apply to booking award travel. Traveling in January, February, September, and October can offer significant savings. Booking a late morning or early afternoon flight (before 3 p.m.) will likely yield fewer delays and fewer chances of a cancellation. Lastly, consider flying on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays to save some cash on airfare prices. Since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, many airlines have moved to more flexible change and cancellation policies. If you booked a fare that allows for changes or cancellations with no added fees (typically, basic economy tickets allow for no changes), set a price alert immediately after booking. If you see a price drop, cancel your flight and rebook. Be sure you\u2019re aware of the airline\u2019s policies, as sometimes you\u2019ll get your refund in the form of a travel voucher instead of your original payment method. According to the Expedia 2024 Air Travel Hacks Report, domestic flights are best booked at least 28 days before departure for optimal savings. For international travel, it is recommended to book around 60 days in advance, ideally no more than four months out. Airfare prices can fluctuate frequently based on demand, holidays, seasonal changes, and overall volatility. For example, high fuel costs and consumer demand can push ticket prices up. It\u2019s recommended to start monitoring them at least 3-4 months before departure for domestic flights and 5-7 months for international flights. Shoulder seasons are periods just before or after peak travel times when prices are usually lower and destinations are less crowded. Traveling during these times can enhance your overall experience and cost less. The best way to find the cheapest airline ticket price is to shop around. Use flight comparison tools and set price alerts for your desired routes. Being flexible in departure and arrival days can also lead to savings. Aim to book domestic flights 1-2 months in advance and international flights 3-6 months ahead. Consider traveling during off-peak times and explore alternative airports for better deals. Additionally, check airline websites directly for exclusive offers. Combining these strategies can significantly enhance your chances of securing the best fares. To secure the best flight deals, you\u2019ll need to understand pricing trends and booking strategies. The best time to book domestic flights is around 28 days before departure. In comparison, international flights should be booked approximately 60 days in advance. You can significantly save on your travel expenses by timing your purchases, flying during off-peak days, and using comparison tools and rewards. Flexibility in your travel plans, such as when you travel and what day of the week you fly, will enhance your chances of landing the best rates. You can also save money using an airline miles credit card to book flights, which will help you earn miles or points toward future air travel. Be sure to join one or more frequent flyer programs to rack up additional money-saving miles.

            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.  Financial health is a term used to describe the state of one's personal monetary affairs. There are many dimensions to financial health, including the amount of savings you have, how much you\u2019re putting away for retirement, and how much of your income you are spending on fixed or non-discretionary expenses. Financial experts have devised rough guidelines for each indicator of financial health, but every individual's situation is different. For this reason, it is worthwhile to spend time developing your own financial plan to ensure that you are on track to reach your goals and that you\u2019re not putting yourself at undue financial risk if the unexpected occurs. To get a better grasp of your financial health, it might help to ask yourself a few key questions\u2014consider this a self-assessment of your financial health: An individual\u2019s financial health can be measured in a number of ways. A person\u2019s savings and overall net worth represent the monetary resources at their disposal for current or future use. These can be affected by debt, such as credit card debt, mortgages, and auto and student loans. Financial health is not static. It changes based on an individual\u2019s liquidity and assets, as well as the fluctuation of the price of goods and services. An individual\u2019s salary might remain constant, for example, while the costs of gasoline, food, mortgages, and college tuition increase. Despite the solid state of their initial financial health, they may lose ground and lapse into decline if they do not keep pace with the rising cost of goods. Typical signs of strong financial health include a steady flow of income, rare changes in expenses, strong returns on investments that have been made, and a cash balance that is growing and is on track to continue to grow. To improve your financial health you must first take a hard, realistic look at where you are currently. Calculate your net worth and figure out where you stand. This includes tallying up everything you own, such as retirement accounts, vehicles, and other assets, and subtracting any and all debts. Next, you need to create a budget. With your budget, it\u2019s not enough just to plan for where you will be spending: you must also take a close look at where you already spend. Are there areas where you could cut back? Recurring subscriptions that you don\u2019t really need\u2014such as cable? Distinguishing between your \u201cneeds\u201d (mortgage, food, utilities, transportation) and your \u201cwants\u201d (gym memberships, dining out, your morning latte) can help you identify items in your budget that are more expendable. Use spreadsheets or mobile apps to help set up a budget. Or, use the time-tested envelope method, which involves creating an envelope for each budget item, such as groceries, and keeping the allocated cash for it in the respective envelope. Then, when you do your food shopping, you take money out of that envelope. One of the major keys to staying on budget and maintaining your financial health is to stick to your plan regardless of whether you start making more money or bringing in more income. Lifestyle creep, which includes spending more money as you make more money, is detrimental to your financial health. One budgeting strategy to consider is the 50/30/20 rule, popularized by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D, Mass.). It says that 50% of your salary should go towards needs, such as housing, food, transportation, and utilities; 30% should be used for \"wants,\" such as eating out, entertainment, and travel; and 20% should go towards savings. Building an emergency fund can materially boost your financial health. The fund is meant to be money that you've saved and that is readily available for emergencies, such as car repairs or a job loss. The goal should be to have three to six months\u2019 worth of living expenses in your emergency fund. Debt can interfere with your financial health, so it's important to pay it down as quickly as you can. Use either the avalanche or the snowball method. The avalanche method suggests paying as much as possible toward the highest-interest debt while paying the minimum on all others. The snowball, meanwhile, suggests taking the smallest debt balance first and then working your way up to the largest debt. There are pros and cons to each; pick the one that works the best for your debt load and your money-handling preferences. Many Americans are inadequately prepared for retirement. According to a 2024 AARP survey, 20% of those age 50+ had no retirement savings and more than half were worried that they didn't have enough saved to see them through retirement. Having enough money to retire takes planning. In general, the earlier you start to save for your post-work life, the better, so your money has time to grow. If you have a workplace retirement plan with an employer match, try to save at least as much as is needed to receive the match. Also, consider opening an individual retirement account (IRA) to put away additional funds. When it comes to effective personal finance, keeping your financial health in tip-top shape isn\u2019t always easy. We get caught up with living life. However, here are a few quick rules and tips that you can follow to either maintain or improve your financial health. The financial health of businesses can be gauged by comparable factors to assess the viability of a company as a going concern. For instance, if a company has revenue coming in and cash in the bank, yet is spending its resources on new investments in production equipment, office space, new hires, and other business services, it may raise questions about the long-term financial health and survivability of the company. If more money is spent that does not contribute to the overall stability and potential growth of the business, it can lead to a decline that makes it difficult to pay regular expenses such as utilities and employee salaries. This may force businesses to freeze or cut salaries in order to give the company the ability to continue operations. Financial health is a term for the state of your personal financial affairs. It includes the amount you have in assets (home, savings, retirement accounts, and more), your level of debt (student, credit card, and other types of debt), and the amount of income you spend on nondiscretionary items, such as housing, food, and transportation. The amount you save for retirement depends upon numerous factors, including your salary, your life goals, and how much you will need in retirement. But given that many haven't saved enough\u2014a 2024 AARP survey found that one in five Americans ages 50+ had no retirement savings\u2014it's smart to start in your 20s and save at least 15% of your income annually throughout your working years. Another way to think about it, and one that many experts recommend, is to save 10 times your pre-retirement salary and plan on living on 80% of your pre-retirement annual income. The signs of good financial health typically include earning a regular income and strong returns on your investments and having infrequent changes in your expenses and a cash balance that is growing. Good financial health means that you are successfully managing all the facets of your financial life. It takes work to stay on top of your finances as you go through life and meet your changing needs and goals, such college education for your kids, home ownership, and travel. It's important to invest money in retirement funds for your future, including in a workplace plan like a 401(k) as well as individual retirement accounts. Meeting with a financial planner can help you strategize for all of your goals.

            "content": "Dissaving is spending money beyond one's available income. This may be accomplished by tapping into a savings account, taking cash advances on a credit card, or borrowing against future income via a payday loan. To state it concisely, dissaving is living beyond one's means. Negative savings is another term associated with dissaving. If the practice is unchecked, dissaving may continue in a downward spiral until an individual's savings and available credit are exhausted. It should be noted that not all dissaving has a negative connotation. For example, a retired person who has saved over a lifetime of work may live comfortably while dissaving. The person has a certain fixed income but spends more every month, dipping into savings to make up the difference. This might be called planned dissaving. Dissaving may be seen on an individual or a macroeconomic level. When dissaving occurs on the macroeconomic scale, it indicates that an entire population or government is spending all available funds, is not investing or saving, and is borrowing to keep afloat. Eventually, even the installment debt repayments become unmanageable. Dissaving may reach a tipping point in the wake of a natural disaster such as an earthquake, hurricane, or wildfire. Other causes may include political upheaval, war, civil disorder, and hyperinflation. Without funds to fall back upon, people or their government resort to borrowing to provide for their basic needs. Dissaving may be a habit caused by poor judgment or an unavoidable response to a crisis. Unemployment, an unexpected illness, and accidents are all events outside of an individual's control that can exhaust savings and cause a cash crunch. A habit of dissaving can begin with a series of relatively small credit card expenditures. Over time, this can result in a hefty credit card balance and an income that is compromised by regular payments at a high rate of interest. Regular savings slow down or stop as the person juggles debt payments. An unexpected event can now be a personal financial disaster. The United States endured a government shutdown for more than a month from late December 2018 to late January 2019. Many federal employees and contractors were furloughed or forced to take unpaid leave. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimated that about 340,000 federal employees were furloughed, while another 460,000 were required to work even though they wouldn't receive a paycheck until government funding resumed. Without regular paychecks, many of these people became forced into dissaving just to survive and to pay their monthly financial obligations.

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Cost of living data includes the expenses incurred for food, shelter, transportation, energy, clothing, education, healthcare, childcare, and entertainment. A cost of living index tracks how much basic expenses for these categories rise over time and in different regions. It can demonstrate how need-based expenses vary from one area to another. The costs of consumer goods and services vary between urban and suburban residential areas. A person's salary might provide a high standard of living in a small city in the Midwest. But it might not do the same in a large city like New York, Los Angeles, or Boston. An amount of $100 may purchase more goods and services in Iowa than in Texas. No official cost of living index is provided by the U.S. government, but a few organizations track the costs of living throughout the country. Learn about the Social Security Administration's 2.5% cost of living benefit increase for 2025. Most indexes set a base\u00a0cost of living, often\u00a0represented by\u00a0100. The base\u00a0can be the cost of living in one\u00a0region or the average of multiple regions. For example, Chicago could be pegged as the base city, and other regions would be measured against the base and assigned a cost of living number accordingly. If it is 20% more expensive to live in Boston than in the base city, Chicago, Boston's cost of living number is 120. The average income for a geographic area is a factor in evaluating a region's cost of living. A small town in the rural south might have a lower cost of living than most towns on the east or west coasts. However, the southern town's median income might be below the cost of living for that area. The cost of living can impact a person's choice of work and where to live, and affect the ability to save for a home or pay off college debt. The Economic Policy Institute\u00a0provides families with updated\u00a0cost of living data for various metro areas throughout the U.S. with a helpful Family Budget Calculator. The calculator helps families measure the differences in the cost of living for geographic locations and figures the costs of food, housing, child care, transportation, health care, other necessities, and taxes. Based on 2023 data, the calculator found that the San Francisco metro area was the most expensive area for parents with two children. The cost of living was estimated at $181,277 per year, while the median income for San Francisco was approximately $169,883 per year. Although a salary of $169,883 is highly attractive, it doesn't cover the costs to live in San Francisco. The Cost of Living Index\u00a0or COLI (formerly called the ACCRA COLI) is designed to compare the living expenses for various regions of the country. The index measures consumer spending on housing, utilities, groceries, health care, and transportation. The quarterly publication is compiled and produced by the Council for Community and Economic Research. For the second quarter of 2024, the COLI shows that Manhattan, New York had the highest cost of living, followed by Honolulu, Hawaii. Ponka City, Oklahoma had the lowest. While not a cost of living index, the Social Security Administration's cost of living adjustment (COLA) reflects the broad increase in costs represented by the rate of inflation, which is the pace of rising prices as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The COLA is announced each year and increases the Social Security benefits paid to retirees. For 2025, benefits will increase by 2.5%. If a retiree earns $20,000 per year in benefits and inflation rises by 3% per year, the purchasing power of the income will decrease over time. The COLA increases can help combat the effect of inflation. The CPI is the average price of a basket of basic goods and services that are selected to measure rising prices in an economy. CPI includes prices for housing, apparel, transportation, education, food, and beverages. Below is a table from the Social Security Administration detailing the cost of living adjustments each year since 1975. Source: The Social Security Administration There are limitations to using CPI as an index since it does not measure the actual costs of living in a given area or region.\u00a0A typical cost of living indicator shows changes in costs over time that are required to maintain a specific standard of living. A cost of living indicator factors in changes in consumer buying that stem from economic conditions, adjustments in spending, and habits that people make, such as using alternative products when a product becomes prohibitively expensive. The process of shifting expenditures is commonly referred to as substitution. The CPI is the average price of a selected basket of goods and services that measures rising prices in an economy but is not a cost of living index. The CPI does not measure the costs of living in a given area or region. Cost of living indexes have a baseline of 100, with figures above or below representing an area as more expensive or less expensive.\u00a0 An index figure below 100 means the area is less expensive to live in than the national average. The cost of living is affected by the average income and prices in an area. When residents earn more, their housing, food, and gas will cost more in the region. The cost of living is also affected by access to resources and the lifestyle of the residents. Cost of living indexes measure the costs of food, shelter, transportation, energy, clothing, healthcare, and childcare and compare the expenses of one geographic region to another.

            "title": "5 Things You Shouldn\u2019t Do During a Recession",
            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. In a sluggish economy or an outright recession, it is best to watch your spending and not take undue risks that could put your financial well-being and goals in jeopardy. Below are several specific financial risks that you should avoid taking during a recession.\u00a0Sidestepping them can help you weather the economic storm. Co-signing a loan is a risky commitment even in flush economic times. If the borrower does not make the required payments, the co-signer will be required to make them instead. During an economic downturn, the risks associated with co-signing on debt are even higher, since both the borrower and the co-signer may face an elevated likelihood of losing a job or a decline in business income. That said, you may find it necessary to co-sign for a family member or close friend regardless of what is happening in the economy. In such cases, it pays to have some savings set aside as a cushion. Or, instead of co-signing, you might help with a down payment or make a personal loan rather than leaving yourself on the hook for a co-signed loan. When purchasing a home, you have the choice of an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) or a fixed-rate mortgage. Interest rates usually fall early in a recession and then rise later as the economy recovers. This means that the adjustable rate for a loan taken out during a recession is likely to rise once the downturn ends. The fixed-rate loan at recession pricing could be a better deal in the long run. While interest rates usually fall early in a recession, credit requirements are often stricter, making it challenging for some borrowers to qualify for the best interest rates and loans. Consider the worst-case scenario: You lose your job and interest rates rise as the recession starts to abate. Your monthly mortgage payments go up, making it extremely difficult to keep current on the payments. Late payments and nonpayment lower your credit rating, making it more difficult to obtain a loan in the future. A recession may be a good time to lock in a lower fixed rate on a mortgage refinance if you qualify.\u00a0However, be cautious about taking on new debt until you see signs that the economy is recovering. Taking on new debt\u2014such as a car loan, home equity line of credit (HELOC), or student loan\u2014need not be a problem in good times when you can make enough money to cover monthly payments and still save for retirement. But when the economy takes a turn for the worse, the risk that you will be laid off or lose business income increases. If that happens, you may have to take a job\u2014or jobs\u2014that pay less than your previous salary, which could eat into your ability to pay your debt. Taking on new debt in a recession is risky and should be approached with caution. Pay cash if you can, or wait on big new purchases. During an economic slowdown, even large corporations can come under financial pressure, leading them to look for cost cuts. All too often, that means layoffs. Because jobs become so vulnerable during a recession, workers can\u2019t take finding another one for granted, so it is wise to think carefully before leaving a job when the economy is in a rough patch. In addition, older workers retiring during a recession could see their income decline and their retirement portfolio suffer just as they start to draw it down. If the economy is tumbling as you near retirement age, it\u2019s important to weigh your options. You might decide to hang in there for another year or so. This tip applies to business owners. While you should always be thinking about the future and ways to grow your business, an economic slowdown may not be the best time to make risky bets. Early on in a recession is not the time to stick your neck out. Later, once the economy starts to show signs of a sustainable recovery, it will be time to start thinking big. Borrowing to add space or increase inventory may sound appealing\u2014particularly since interest rates are likely to be low during a recession. But if business slows down more\u2014as it may during a recession\u2014you may struggle to make the payments on your debt. Wait until interest rates just start to tick upward and leading economic indicators for your market or industry turn up. A recession is a meaningful and extensive downturn in economic activity. A common definition holds that two consecutive quarters of decline in\u00a0gross domestic product (GDP) constitute a recession. In general, recessions bring decreased economic output, lower consumer demand, and higher unemployment. Many types of financial risks are heightened in a recession. This means that you\u2019re better off avoiding some risks that you might take in better economic times\u2014such as co-signing a loan, taking out an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), or taking on new debt. A recession is no time to panic, but you should be conscious of the potential for layoffs in your industry and the difficulty you may have in finding a new job if you end up unemployed. If you own a business, it is best to avoid overextending yourself with risky new investments until the inevitable turnaround begins. There is no surefire way to position your investment portfolio during a recession. In some cases\u2014particularly if you have a longer investment horizon that will give your assets time to recover from any losses during the recession\u2014you may benefit from leaving your portfolio alone. This keeps you invested in the markets and poised to gain from an eventual recovery. If you decide to make some changes to your investment strategy in response to economic concerns, there are ways to reduce your risk. Most stocks and high-yield bonds tend to lose value in a recession, while lower-risk assets\u2014such as gold and U.S. Treasuries\u2014tend to appreciate. Within the stock market, shares of large companies with solid cash flows and dividends tend to outperform in downturns. There\u2019s no need to panic in response to an economic slowdown, but you should pay extra attention to your spending and be wary of taking unnecessary risks. Even in the midst of a significant economic downturn, there are many positive steps you can take to improve your situation and recession-proof your life. These include adopting a realistic budget, establishing an emergency fund, and generating additional sources of income if necessary."

            "title": "Understand the Different Types of Inflation",
            "content": " blackred\u00a0/ Getty Images At its most basic level, inflation is a general increase in prices across the economy and is well-known to all of us. After all, who among us has not reminisced about the cheap rents of the past or how little lunch used to cost? And who has not noticed prices on everything from milk to movie tickets creeping upward? In this article, we explore the major types of inflation and touch upon the competing explanations offered by different economic schools. We can define inflation with relative ease, but the question of what causes inflation is significantly more complex. Although numerous theories exist, arguably the two most influential schools of thought on inflation are those of Keynesian and monetarist economics. Stagflation (a time of economic stagnation combined with inflation) can wreak havoc. This type of inflation is a witch\u2019s brew of economic adversity,\u00a0combining poor economic growth, high unemployment, and severe inflation all in one. Although recorded instances of stagflation are rare, the phenomenon occurred as recently as the 1970s, when it gripped the United States and the United Kingdom\u2014much to the dismay of both nations\u2019 central banks. Stagflation poses a particularly daunting challenge to central banks because it increases the risks associated with fiscal and monetary policy responses. Whereas central banks can usually raise interest rates to combat high inflation, doing so in a period of stagflation could risk further increasing unemployment. Conversely, central banks are limited in their ability to decrease interest rates in times of stagflation because\u00a0doing so could cause inflation to rise even further. As such, stagflation acts as a kind of check-mate against central banks, leaving them with no moves left to make. Stagflation is arguably the most difficult type of inflation to manage. Although as consumers we may hate rising prices, many economists believe a moderate degree of inflation is healthy for a nation\u2019s economy. Typically, central banks aim to maintain inflation around 2% to 3%. Increases in inflation significantly beyond this range can lead to fears of possible hyperinflation, a devastating scenario in which inflation rises rapidly out of control. There have been several notable instances of hyperinflation throughout history. The most famous example is Germany during the early 1920s when\u00a0inflation reached 30,000% per month. Zimbabwe offers an even more extreme example. According to research by Steve H. Hanke\u00a0and Alex K. F. Kwok,\u00a0monthly price increases in Zimbabwe\u00a0reached an estimated 79,600,000,000% in November\u00a02008. Also known as deflation, negative inflation occurs when prices drop for various reasons. Having a smaller money supply increases the value of money, which in turn decreases prices. A reduction in demand either because there is too large of a supply or a reduction in consumer spending can also cause negative inflation. Deflation may seem like a good thing because it reduces the prices of goods and services, thus making them more affordable, but it can negatively affect the economy in the long run. When businesses make less money on their products, they are forced to cut costs, which often means laying off or terminating employees, thereby increasing unemployment. Keynesian economists argue inflation results from economic pressures such as the increased cost of production\u00a0and look to government intervention as a solution; monetarist economists believe inflation stems from the expansion\u00a0of the money supply and that central banks should maintain stable growth for the money supply in line with GDP. The Keynesian school believes inflation results from economic pressures such as rising costs of production or increases in aggregate demand. Specifically, it distinguishes between two broad types of inflation:\u00a0cost-push inflation\u00a0and\u00a0demand-pull inflation. Monetarists have historically explained inflation as a consequence of an expanding money supply. The monetarist view is perfectly encapsulated by Friedman\u2019s remark that \u201cinflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.\u201d According to this view, the principal factor underlying inflation has little to do with things like labor, materials costs,\u00a0or consumer demand. Instead, it is all about the supply of money. At the heart of this perspective is the quantity theory of money, which posits the relationship between the money supply and inflation is governed by the relationship M\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\nV\n\n\n=\n\n\nP\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\nT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n\n=\n\n\nThe\u00a0money\u00a0supply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n=\n\n\nThe\u00a0velocity\u00a0of\u00a0money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\n\n\n=\n\n\nThe\u00a0average\u00a0price\u00a0level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n=\n\n\nThe\u00a0volume\u00a0of\u00a0transactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{aligned} &M*V = P*T\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &M = \\text{The money supply}\\\\ &V = \\text{The velocity of money}\\\\ &P = \\text{The average price level}\\\\ &T = \\text{The volume of transactions} \\end{aligned}\n\n\n\u200bM\u2217V=P\u2217Twhere:M=The\u00a0money\u00a0supplyV=The\u00a0velocity\u00a0of\u00a0moneyP=The\u00a0average\u00a0price\u00a0levelT=The\u00a0volume\u00a0of\u00a0transactions\u200b Implicit in this equation is the belief that if the velocity of money and the volume of transactions are constant, an increase (or decrease) in the supply of money will cause a corresponding increase (or decrease) in the average price level. Given that the velocity of money and the volume of transactions are in reality never constant, it follows that this relationship is not as straightforward as it may initially seem. Nevertheless, this equation serves as an effective model of the monetarists\u2019 belief that the expansion of the money supply is the principal cause of inflation. The main causes of inflation are classified as demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. Demand-pull inflation is when the demand for goods and services exceeds production capacity; cost-push inflation is when an increase in production costs increases prices; built-in inflation is when prices rise and wages rise too in order to maintain purchasing parity. When prices rise, borrowers generally benefit from inflation because they are paying back debts with money that has depreciated since prices increased. For example, if they have a fixed monthly payment of $1,000 and prices go up, that $1,000 is worth less than what it was before. Borrowers can also benefit from inflation as the increase in prices may result in people needing to borrow money more. During periods of inflation, some of the worst sectors to invest in are retail, durable goods, and technology. This is because when inflation happens, people tend to spend less due to the higher prices, and these sectors are often the ones where people begin to cut back on spending. Inflation comes in many forms, from historically extreme cases of hyperinflation and stagflation to the five-cent and 10-cent increases we hardly notice. Economists from the Keynesian and monetarist schools disagree on the root causes of inflation, underscoring the fact that inflation is a far more complex phenomenon than one might initially assume.

            "content": "Learn about the pros and cons of taking loans from loved ones Amy Fontinelle has more than 15 years of experience covering personal finance, corporate finance and investing. Katie Miller is a consumer financial services expert. She worked for almost two decades as an executive, leading multi-billion dollar mortgage, credit card, and savings portfolios with operations worldwide and a unique focus on the consumer. Her mortgage expertise was honed post-2008 crisis as she implemented the significant changes resulting from Dodd-Frank required regulations. When you're unemployed, out of savings, and your unemployment check doesn\u2019t cover the bills, you may need another place to turn for money. Depending on your situation, you may be able to withdraw money from a 401(k) or ask your parents for a loan. While neither option is ideal, here are some considerations, including risks to keep in mind, to help you decide. In you are unemployed, you can withdraw money from your 401(k) but there are caveats. In general, withdrawals will be treated as distributions, so they will be subject to income taxes. If you are under 59\u00bd you'll also pay an additional 10% penalty on the amount withdrawn, though there are a few exceptions. The good news is that if you become unemployed in the year you turn 55 (or after), the funds in your 401(k) can be accessed without being subject to the 10% penalty.\u00a0In other words, you don\u2019t have to wait until you reach age 59\u00bd. Unfortunately, this does not apply to those who rolled over their 401(k) into an individual retirement account (IRA). Another exception applies if you are under 55. You can access your funds without paying a penalty through what is called substantially equal periodic payments (SEPP). Under this arrangement, payments must be distributed over at least five years or until you reach 59\u00bd, whichever comes first. Taking early withdrawals from your 401(k) can also put your long-term financial health at risk. The withdrawn funds miss out on long-term growth and the power of compounding. \u201cIf the child is a responsible adult and has fallen on hard times, and this is not a recurring issue, then I would go to the parents for a loan and set up a payback plan in writing,\u201d says Ashley M. Micciche, CEO, and retirement plan specialist with True North Retirement Advisors in Clackamas, Ore. \u201cThe long-term impact of a withdrawal from a retirement account is very damaging, especially when it\u2019s someone in their 20s and 30s.\u201d However, you probably have more years to make up for lost ground than your parents. A loan isn\u2019t necessarily a bad idea, but you should take it only if your parents or another loved one can afford it and you will repay the loan as agreed. While many plan sponsors allow 401(k) plan participants to take a loan, this is not an option for the unemployed. Once you are no longer an employee, in general you are not eligible take a loan from your 401(k). If a 401(k) withdrawal is your best or only option, consider how you can minimize the financial damage from the lost investment opportunity and early withdrawal penalties. First, keep taxes in mind. If you\u2019ve already earned substantial income for the year, see if you can wait until next year to make a withdrawal. Try to limit your withdrawal to the minimum you will need to meet your essential living expenses for the rest of the year. Second, consider alternative sources of funds. \u201cIf you have a Roth 401(k), you can take out your contributions\u2014not the earnings on the investments\u2014at any time without tax or penalty,\u201d says Maggie Johndrow, a financial advisor with the Johndrow Wealth Group of Farmington River Financial in Farmington, Conn. Similarly, if you have a Roth IRA, you can withdraw contributions without penalty. Third, keep the setback to your 401(k) balance in mind when job hunting. \u201cI would suggest finding a job that has a 401(k) that includes a high employer 401(k) match. This may help rebuild retirement savings,\u201d Johndrow says. Once you're working again, aim to contribute beyond the minimum required to get the employer match. Also consider funding an additional retirement account, such as an IRA, to offset some of the retirement savings you withdrew while unemployed. Your parents might be willing to help you, but think twice before accepting their financial generosity. \u201cThe most important thing to consider is where the money your parents are giving you is coming from,\u201d says Misty Lynch, a financial consultant with John Hancock. \u201cIf they are wealthy and offer to help you out of cash flow or savings, that could be a good option, since any distribution you make from your 401(k) will be subject to taxes and penalties. You can repay them and start contributing to your retirement savings when you get back on your feet.\u201d However, try to avoid accepting money from your parents that is meant for their retirement. \u201cIf they spend down their retirement assets, they might not have any time to build them back up,\" Lynch says. \"Working into their 70s or 80s might be really difficult, and they might be forced to rely on you to help them out financially in the future.\" In these cases, it can be better to take the distribution from your own assets and make saving a priority when you start work again. If your parents can comfortably help you out, spell out expectations in a written contract. Experts say you can minimize potential conflicts this way. \u201cThe child should also pay interest to the parents, similar to what they would pay for borrowing from their 401(k),\u201d says Ashley M. Micciche, CEO, and retirement plan specialist with True North Retirement Advisors in Clackamas, Ore. \u201cPrime plus 2% is a good starting point.\u201d Other details, such as the repayment period and the amount of each monthly payment, should also be in writing, she says. The challenge is that the child may have no means of making loan payments right away. \u201cThe best option here could be to allow the child to defer payments until they find employment, while the loan accrues interest\u2014which should help incentivize the child to find work soon,\u201d says Micciche. Borrowing money from family can potentially damage your relationship if you don\u2019t repay the loan on time, especially if your parents don\u2019t agree with how you\u2019re spending the money or conducting your job search. If your plan allows 401(k) loans, in general you can borrow up to $50,000 or 50% of the assets in your account, whichever is less. The loan is typically paid back in installments through payroll deductions and in most cases within five years. If you are unemployed and have money in a 401(k) account at a former employer, you cannot take a loan. How much money you can borrow from your parents depends on how much they can afford and are willing to lend you. If you do end up borrowing money from a loved one, to avoid potential conflicts make sure to have a written agreement that spells out the terms of the loan. While there are a few exceptions, if you withdraw money from a retirement account, such as a 401(k) or IRA, before age 59\u00bd you'll pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty. The 10% penalty is in addition to any income taxes you might owe on the amount withdrawn. You don\u2019t want to take on expensive credit card debt. You can\u2019t get a loan when you don\u2019t have an income. So do you sacrifice your future and withdraw from the 401(k) plan you had at your last job? Or do you swallow your pride and ask Mom and Dad or another relative for a loan? If you choose to withdraw from your 401(k), be prepared to pay income tax on the amount withdrawn. You may also be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59\u00bd and don't qualify for any exceptions. Also be sure to consider the long-term impact on your retirement savings. If it makes more sense to take a loan from your parents or another loved one, make sure that they can truly afford it, there is a written agreement, and that you are able to pay it back consistently and on time.

            "title": "Women Should Plan for 100-Year Life: Merrill",
            "content": "When it comes to lifelong financial well-being, women are at a disadvantage Women\u2019s\u00a0growing career and financial power don\u2019t necessarily translate into long-term financial wellness. That\u2019s the takeaway from a Merrill/Age Wave study, Women & Financial Wellness: Beyond the Bottom Line. \u201cWomen are driving big changes in the labor force, in their communities and workplaces, and in their homes,\u201d said Sheri Bronstein, global human resources executive at Bank of America, at a panel announcing the study when it was published in April 2018. But while much has changed, women are still at a disadvantage when it comes to financial well-being. Women are\u00a0less likely than their male peers to invest, though 84% believe that understanding their finances is key to greater career flexibility. Their biggest financial regret is \u201cnot investing more.\u201d That doesn't mean women are leaving it all to chance. Only one in four women 18 and older has not planned at all for her future.\u00a0What's holding women back from doing more? The study cites women are \u201cnot having the knowledge to invest\u201d and \u201cnot having the confidence\u201d as the major reasons they do not invest. Though women tend to be as confident as men in completing most financial tasks, they are notably less so when it comes to investing their money (52% are confident compared to 68% of men). Adding to the lack of confidence is social taboo: 61% of women surveyed would prefer to talk about their own death than about money. \u201cMillennial women had the least confidence in investing,\u201d said Maddy Dychtwald, Age Wave co-founder, while older women were more likely to be confident. \u201cThis presents a significant opportunity for cross-generational mentorship.\u201d It doesn't help that media targeted to women\u00a0is notably thin on financial information. That problem is compounded by the financial services industry which, according to Megan Driscoll, founder and CEO of EvolveMKD, a public relations firm, \u201cdoesn\u2019t advertise in women\u2019s magazines.\u201d Though half of the financial services industry\u2019s customer base\u00a0is female, 70%\u00a0of women report that the financial industry has traditionally catered to men. Part of the problem is that much financial media is written in a male-focused voice, said Diane Harris, former editor-in-chief of Money magazine. Harris found that, while she was editor, 30% of her print subscribers were female. When they shifted their web voice to focus more on women, female readership \u201cjumped to 50%.\u201d Part of it is \u201cspeaking to women in a way they want to be spoken to.\u201d Financial planning models don't typically allow for the kind of breaks from work that many women take to raise children or care for aging family members. Much has been written about the gender pay gap and the numbers bear repeating: Women earn 82 cents for every dollar that a man in a similar position makes. But these present-value figures \u201cfail to demonstrate how the pay gap accumulates and compounds over the course of a woman\u2019s life,\u201d according to Merrill. Though the average woman spends 44%\u00a0of her adult life outside of the workforce, the average man is only removed for 28%. The effects of those career interruptions\u2014to care for children, an ailing parent,\u00a0or an ill spouse\u2014tend to accumulate over time to the tune of a $1,055,000 gap in lifetime earnings between men and women. And that, of course, affects how much money women have to invest. With one in four 65-year-olds\u00a0today living past age 90 and one in 10 living past 95, everyone needs to plan for a longer lifespan. The most prudent\u00a0number: age 100. That's especially true for women, whose average life expectancy is\u00a0five\u00a0years longer than men's. The problem of needing financial security for that longer lifespan is compounded by the fact that women\u00a0tend to retire earlier (perhaps to care for an ailing spouse) and with less saved. Only 9% of American women have $300,000 or more put aside. What they need for a typical retirement, according to the Merrill/Age Wave study, is $738,000. In addition, women's longer lives mean they\u00a0accrue nearly $200,000 more in medical\u00a0expenses in their later years. The sobering out-of-pocket healthcare costs through retirement (including long-term care): $494,000 for men, but $688,000 for women. \"The foundation of saving for retirement hasn't changed to support the 100-year life,\" said Victoria Mazur, head of compensation and benefits at Lord Abbett. \"People aren't thinking about this.\" The study was based on a nationally representative sample of 2,638 women and 1,069 men in the U.S. over the age of 18, surveyed between Oct. 25 and Nov. 22, 2017. \u201cWomen\u2019s life journeys are not only different from men\u2019s, they\u2019re different from the life journeys of our mothers and grandmothers,\u201d said Dychtwald. As Driscoll told the panel, \u201cLaws may change, but attitudes in society take much longer.\u201d Boomers grew up with limitations that took federal legislation to remove.\u00a0Lenders frequently required that women applying for a mortgage loan present\u00a0a spouse's or male relative's signature until the Equal Credit Opportunity Act banned the practice in 1974. And until 1988, women in many states still needed a man\u2019s signature in order to apply for\u00a0a business loan. Thank the Women's Business Ownership Act for ending that inequity. \u201cWomen have come a long way both personally and professionally, but when it comes to their finances, there is still a trail left to blaze,\u201d said Lorna Sabbia, head of Retirement and Personal Wealth Solutions for Bank of America in a statement. What can help women achieve financial wellness? The study has four major recommendations: In other words, women can take control of their financial futures by\u00a0talking with friends, mentors, and professionals about money; starting early so their money has time to grow; saving and planning for career interruptions or more expensive healthcare costs; and planning and making course corrections along the way as needed.

            "content": "Awareness campaigns have led to wage hikes Pete Rathburn is a copy editor and fact-checker with expertise in economics and personal finance and over twenty years of experience in the classroom. As of January 2024, the federal minimum wage stands at just $7.25 per hour despite calls for a $15 minimum wage. According to our research, the top five cities in the United States with the highest minimum wage as of 2024 are: Since its peak in 1968, the minimum wage relative to inflation and the cost of living has fallen steadily. Prior to the early 2010s, few states and municipalities had minimum wages significantly higher than the federal minimum wage. This changed when minimum wage workers came together to spread awareness about their plight. These awareness campaigns were highly successful, drawing support from high-profile activists. These activists have since successfully pushed local governments in several cities to mandate higher minimum wages that enable workers to be self-sufficient. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to support oneself (much less a family) with a minimum wage job (even when working full time), especially in expensive cities. As of January 2024, the minimum wage in Tukwila was $20.29 per hour for large employers and $18.29 for mid-sized employers. Large employers are those with more than 500 employees worldwide. Mid-size employers are those with 15 to 500 worldwide or revenue of more than $2 million earned in Tukwila. In July 2024, the minimum wage paid to employees at mid-sized companies will rise to $19.29. The rate of $20.29 paid by large employers will not rise at that time. Tukwila's minimum wage is adjusted for inflation annually. As of January 2024, the minimum wage in Seattle was $19.97 per hour. A lower rate of $17.25 applies if a small business (with 500 or fewer employees) pays $2.72 per hour toward medical benefits for employees or an employee earns $2.72 per hour in tips. In June 2014, Seattle made history when its city council signed into law a mandate to raise the minimum wage for all workers in the city to $15 per hour. The city became the first in the U.S. to have a $15 minimum wage. At that time, no other city had a minimum wage that was even close. In 2023, both large and small businesses paid a minimum wage of $18.69 per hour. A lower rate of $16.50 applied if a small business paid $2.19 per hour toward medical benefits for employees or the employee earned $2.19 per hour in tips. Seattle's minimum wage is adjusted for inflation annually. As of January 2024, the minimum wage in SeaTac was $19.71 per hour. That rate is only available to employees working in the city\u2019s hospitality and transportation industries. Aside from those workers, SeaTac\u2019s general minimum wage is the same as the state minimum wage, which is $16.28 per hour. SeaTac's minimum wage is adjusted for inflation annually. As of January 2024, the minimum wage in Mountain View was $18.75 per hour. Mountain View established its own minimum wage on Jan. 1, 2015, at $10.30 per hour. It was set to rise by a specified amount each year until it reached $15 in 2018. Since 2019, Mountain View's minimum wage has been adjusted for inflation annually. As of July 2023, the minimum wage in Emeryville was $18.67. It is set to rise again in July 2024. When Emeryville established its minimum wage ordinance on July 2, 2015, there were two minimum wage levels. These were $12.25 per hour for employees up to 55 years old and $14.44 per hour for those no younger than 56 years old. By 2019, the age categories no longer applied. Emeryville's minimum wage rate is adjusted for inflation annually. Several states have passed bills that will eventually put all cities in their jurisdictions at $15 or more per hour. Workers in some of these cities will have to wait a few years to benefit from the new minimum wage laws fully. For example, Florida residents voted in November 2020 to increase the state\u2019s minimum wage incrementally (beginning at $10 per hour on Sept. 30, 2021) until it reaches $15 per hour in September 2026. As of January 2024, it is $12 per hour. Other states have minimum wages above the federal level, with 22 of those states increasing their wages further in 2024. California ($16), Connecticut ($15.69), Maryland ($15), Massachusetts ($15), New Jersey ($15.13), New York ($15; higher depending on area), and Washington ($16.28). Washington, D.C. has a minimum wage of $17. No. These states have no minimum wage law: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee. In this case, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 applies. Georgia and Wyoming have minimum wage rates of $5.15. In this case, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 applies. The federal minimum wage of $7.25 has not increased since 2009 and is now too low to allow for families to live above the poverty line. Due to demands from workers, many states, cities, and municipalities have a minimum wage above the federal rate. There continues to be a push to increase the federal minimum wage to $15, but it has been met with significant resistance.

            "content": "J.B. Maverick is an active trader, commodity futures broker, and stock market analyst 17+ years of experience, in addition to 10+ years of experience as a finance writer and book editor. Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University. Quicken is one of several well-known, widely used, and highly successful financial software programs developed by Intuit, Inc. (INTU). Intuit subsequently sold its personal financial management tool to private equity firm H.I.G. Capital in 2016. Quicken offers users services from basic checking and savings account management and budgeting, all the way to portfolio analysis and management features such as capital gains tracking. There are Windows-based versions of the program available as well as for Mac that's\u00a0compatible with Apple's operating system. Although manufactured for a number of global markets, Quicken remains focused largely on a North American customer base. While Quicken has dominated its niche market since its first release in 1983, there are a number of similar, alternative products available and which are increasingly challenging its dominance. Empower represents an attractive and less expensive alternative to Quicken for individuals who prefer a cloud-based program\u2014and one that offers extensive investment management tools. In fact, as of March 31, 2024, it had $1.6 trillion in assets under management (AUM). The basic Empower financial services package, which includes account tracking, budgeting, bill paying, and other basic services, is free. However, Empower makes its money primarily from individuals, with a minimum of $100,000 in assets, who choose to upgrade to the personal wealth management services the company offers. Fees begin at 0.89% for the first $1 million of assets managed and range down to 0.49% (for accounts over $10 million) per year. Empower's fees are significantly lower than average for full wealth management services. With the paid wealth management service, clients are assigned a personal financial advisor and receive all the usual services a client expects from a wealth management company, including tax and estate planning, tax-loss harvesting, advice on insurance, educational funds for children, and any other necessary services to provide full financial management for clients. But even the free personal finance services offered are extensive and competitive with what is offered by Quicken. Included are services such as budgeting, a retirement planner, net worth analyzer, and an investment allocation target checker. The budgeting component includes a cash flow tool that allows individuals to input income and spending, and then receive weekly, monthly, or annual analyses of their projected cash flows. The retirement planner can be used to map out a retirement plan, and then to monitor how closely the user is adhering to the plan. This feature allows users to set spending and savings goals, track income events, and project the future value of their investment portfolios. Its asset allocation component determines a user's risk tolerance profile and then makes appropriate investment allocation recommendations. The comprehensive features and the flexibility of input variables offered in this module compare favorably to any comparable service, free or paid. Empower has received good reviews on a number of levels, one being that it offers better account synchronization than most programs of this type. It also receives high marks for customer service, a rare plus for a free financial services software program. Empower offers much more in-depth investment analysis and planning than Quicken. It also offers enhanced security through its use of multi-factor authentication. Empower services are accessible by computer, tablet, or cellphone. Debuting in 2004, iBank was designed by IGG Software specifically for Apple's operating systems\u2014at first, macOS (for desk- and laptops), and later iOS (for iPhones and iPads). IGG re-christened it Banktivity in 2016. Aiming to serve as a personal or small business financial management program, Banktivity offers a myriad of financial services, including bank, credit card, loan, and investment account management. Features not included in Quicken but that come standard with Banktivity include multicurrency functionality and variable loan amortization. Its platform for reviewing all of an individual's financial accounts can be found on one\u00a0central dashboard: checking, savings, money market, equity and fixed-income investments, retirement accounts, loan accounts, and brokerage accounts. With its continually updated charts, Banktivity stands out for the detailed income, expense, and investment performance analysis it offers, tracking buys and sells of stock shares, dividends, and stock options. The program also allows for easy production and printing of custom financial reports. Quicken. \"About Us.\" Quicken. \"Quicken Completes Acquisition by H.I.G.

            "content": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning. Oscar Wong / Getty Images Social commerce uses networking websites to promote and sell products and services. Social commerce involves the entire shopping experience over social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, and the X platform (formerly Twitter). This means products and services are marketed on these sites, which allow consumers to browse, shop, and make purchases. A social commerce campaign's success is measured by the degree to which consumers interact with the company's marketing through retweets, likes, and shares. As noted above, social commerce involves selling products and services over social media. It encourages social shopping tools, such as forums and communities, where buyers and sellers discuss their online shopping experiences and compare notes. It is an evolving field of online marketing that works in conjunction with social media and online shopping growth. Fashion and shopping-related blogs use social commerce and media to entice shoppers to purchase linked items online. Social commerce professionals create and post messages and interactive features that promote online sales and other e-commerce initiatives. Some of the marketing tactics social commerce employs include: Many popular fashion blogs have Instagram accounts that allow followers to like, share, and comment on the offered product. The tagged article frequently links directly to the store's shopping cart or check-out desk. Consumer interactions (likes, retweets, and shares) determine the success of a social commerce campaign\u2014the more they receive, the more successful they tend to be. The popularity of social networks such as Facebook and Instagram allows vendors to showcase their products and quickly respond to follow buyer-led trends and fads. In the article \"Social Commerce: A New Electronic Commerce,\" Yao Zhong said the concept of consumer marketing promotions online first appeared on the internet in November 2005 in Yahoo! The site promoted their Shoposphere pick lists, which highlighted the most popular products. The notion of social commerce developed further to engage online shoppers by offering reliable advice and support from online experts regarding their purchases. Marketing blogger Jeff Bullas identifies the following four brands as being among the best in the business: Don't confuse social commerce with social shopping. While social commerce collaborates with online vendors, social shopping is a collaboration of online shoppers who network together. Don't confuse social commerce with e-commerce or online shopping. Although there may be some similarities between the two, they are inherently different. As noted above, social commerce is a form of e-commerce that takes place on social media sites. As such, the experience takes place directly and entirely over social media. Online shopping, on the other hand, is a way for people to shop through sites and apps that are devoted entirely to a shopping experience without the social media aspect. For instance, people can make purchases for products and services on dedicated e-commerce sites like Amazon and Alibaba. Or consumers can make purchases directly from the websites of retailers, such as Walmart and Target. Social commerce is a shopping experience that takes place over social media. Companies can market their products and services while consumers can complete purchases entirely over social networking sites like Facebook, Instagram, and X. Social commerce also allows consumers to get support and advice from experts. Although they may seem similar, social commerce and online shopping are two different ideas. While social commerce provides consumers with the entire shopping experience through social media and networking sites, online shopping is done entirely on websites and apps devoted entirely to e-commerce. This includes sites like Amazon and Alibaba, as well as those of individual retailers like Walmart and Target. Market research shows that Facebook is the dominant force in social commerce, reaching as many as 63.5 million social buyers in 2022. This figure is expected to increase to 71.1 million by 2026. Social media allows you to connect, network, and share posts, photos, videos, and experiences. But now, they offer more than just a personal experience. Many social networking sites are now hubs for social commerce. This form of e-commerce allows you to connect with companies and marketers for a complete shopping experience. You can browse and complete purchases for goods and services with the click of a button\u2014all without even leaving your favorite social media site.

            "title": "5 U.S. Cities Where Your Paycheck Goes the Furthest",
            "content": "Many factors influence where we choose to live. While our home's proximity to friends and family is a crucial deciding factor, ultimately where we decide to live is influenced by our finances. The two major factors influencing where we live are the cost of living and the income potential in a given region. The problem with looking at these two factors individually, however, is that they often are highly influenced by one another and have a strong positive correlation. Fat paychecks in New York City and San Francisco translate into $20 salads, exorbitant rents, and surge-priced Uber rides. When we analyze the data, it\u2019s apparent that the most affordable cities to live in while earning an excellent living are in the middle of the country, rather than along the expensive coasts. We\u2019ve compiled a list of the best cities in the United States that combine a low cost of living with relatively high per capita income compared with the rest of the nation. The city of Houston benefits from a high domestic migration rate and a high economic growth rate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2021 population estimates (the most recent data available from the Census Bureau), Texas has experienced the nation's largest population growth for each year between 2010 and 2021. The 2020 Census reports that the population for Texas is 29.1 million people, adding nearly 4 million people between 2010 and 2020, an increase of 15.9%. Houston is one of the state's leading areas of population growth, primarily due to its resilient economy. While Houston is well-known as a major oil town, the city has seen job growth in a variety of sectors, including information technology, biomedicine, aeronautics, and manufacturing. Houston\u2019s average household income was $84,179 in 2020. Houston residents' income levels typically outpace the cost of living, with a fabulous transportation system, relatively affordable housing, and low prices of common consumer goods. The Dallas-Forth Worth hub also lies in the Sunbelt. The city benefits from high net domestic migration and a nonexistent state income tax. In a 2022 cost of living comparison between Dallas and Los Angeles, you would need an income of around $8,151 per month in Los Angeles, California, to maintain the same standard of life that you can have with $4,500 per month in Dallas, Texas. The cost of living in Los Angeles is approximately 75% higher than in Dallas. The most significant differences between the two cities are home prices, which are 240% higher in Los Angeles than in Dallas. Charlotte may seem off the beaten path to some, but to North Carolinians and Southerners who\u2019ve grown up loving the city, the move seems like a no-brainer. Charlotte is a major U.S. financial center and is the headquarters of Bank of America. Other major industries include motorsports and energy. The city is home to the NASCAR Hall of Fame and boasts its own NFL football team, the Carolina Panthers. In 2022, Charlotte's average household income is $94,516. Housing costs are a key factor in Charlotte's affordability, with the median home price coming in at $301,300. Median home costs are 53% lower in Charlotte compared to New York City. Denver is a gorgeous, relatively quiet city situated in the mountains. Downtown is a short half-hour drive from the University of Colorado at Boulder. Many beautiful, smaller towns are in the region, where people can hike with their dogs and families free of charge. According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Living Wage Calculator as of Aug. 2022, a typical annual salary in Denver for a management job is $135,055. Business and financial operations workers typically earn a salary of $80,935. The calculated \u201cliving wage\u201d that individuals must earn to support themselves working full time was $20.31 an hour as opposed to $30.81 in San Francisco. In addition to high wages, Colorado offers a high quality of life which continues to attract lovers of nature and adventure. Dubbed \u201cThe Live Music Capital of the World\u201d and the capital of the Lone Star State, the city of Austin had job growth of 5.1% in 2022 and a 2021 population of about 964,000. The knowledge hub of Austin is home to a new wave of workers who vary from \u201chippie types\u201d to tech-savvy millennials and corporate employees. The influence of the University of Texas has turned the city into a tech hub with a lively downtown full of theaters, art galleries, and restaurants. According to the City of Austin, in 2022 the median four-person household income in Austin is $110,300 and Realtor.com reports that the median home price came in at $659,000. MIT's Living Wage calculator states that a typical annual salary in Austin for a management job is $111,430 and $96,439 for a job in information technology. Career mobility is rising due to the advent of technology, transportation, and communication systems, allowing the U.S. population to move from city to city quite easily. Often, high salaries coincide with a relatively high cost of living. This list of cities highlights a few of the outliers. Cities in the middle of the country, particularly in Texas, place workers in an optimal financial situation. This is due to the net migration, economic boom, and high salary growth rates in these particular hubs. These cities offer a high quality of life due to low prices and decreased financial stresses while providing an opportunity to find a lucrative career.

            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Many people are quick to assume older adults are retired, but the fact is, millions of Americans age 65-plus work either full\u00a0or part-time. The reasons for remaining in the workforce\u2014or re-entering it\u2014can vary. For many, it\u2019s a matter of necessity, especially in the aftermath of the Great Recession, when many people lost their jobs, homes and retirement savings. For others, it\u2019s a matter of choice to stay active, challenged, and engaged in their communities. Most people who work past the age of 65 do so in \u201cbridge\u201d jobs that span the period between leaving a career and leaving the workforce altogether. Thinking about working after retirement age? Here are six popular jobs for people 65 and older. Accounting and bookkeeping clerks use specialized computer accounting software, spreadsheets, and databases to post financial transactions and produce financial reports, such as balance sheets and income statements. Part-time faculty (\u201cadjuncts\u201d)\u00a0accounted for a significant portion of the instructional faculty at nonprofit colleges and universities\u2014and you don\u2019t always need a Ph.D. to snag one of these teaching jobs. While the pay is generally low\u2014perhaps only a few thousand dollars per course\u2014many retirees find the work fulfilling. Plus, once you\u2019ve taught a course a couple of times, you won\u2019t have to devote as many hours to class prep. Even if you\u2019ve never worked as an event planner, you may have planned (or helped plan) dozens of events over the years: birthday parties, weddings, anniversaries and the like. You can put this experience to work to find a job or start your own business,\u00a0tapping into your network of friends and family. Job growth between 2019 and 2029 is expected to be 8%, compared to an average of 4% growth across all occupations, and the median pay was $24.33 per hour in 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Rather than filling a full-time position, many companies will find a consultant to help with a specific project. This can be an excellent way to put your decades of experience to work without committing to a full-time job. Depending on your skill set and experience, it\u2019s possible to earn upwards\u00a0of $50 or even $100 an hour. Retail salespersons held about 4.3 million jobs in the United States in 2019, according\u00a0to\u00a0BLS data\u2014in general merchandise stores (19% of all retail salespersons), clothing stores (16%), building material and supplies dealers (10%), sporting goods, hobby, and musical instrument stores (6%),\u00a0and automobile dealers (6%). Nearly one in three retail workers was employed\u00a0part-time\u00a0in 2020, and the median hourly wage was $12.14 for retail salespersons, as of May 2019. These jobs may have an added\u00a0perk: employee discounts for the products your store sells. Teacher assistants (or aides) work under the supervision of a licensed teacher to give students extra attention and instruction. They may work with an entire class, in small groups or one-on-one in elementary, middle and high schools, preschools, and childcare centers. The BLS estimates job growth of 4% between 2019 and 2029 and the 2019 median pay was $27,920 per year. Many teacher assistants work on a part-time basis, and\u00a0in most school systems, you\u2019ll get your summers off. The best retirement job for any individual will depend on their specific preferences and needs, including schedule, finances, ability, and qualifications. Recently, the National Bureau of Economic Research published a paper on the rise of age-friendly jobs, prompted by the gradual increase of workers over the age of 50. The most age-friendly occupations typically involved strong interpersonal skills over physically strenuous elements. These include: transportation and reservation agents, receptionists, sales workers, and secretaries, labor relations managers, and proofreaders. Retirement income can be composed of many different elements, depending on how you have socked away funds prior to retiring. Some retirees will draw from their retirement savings and work a second job for additional income. Retirees who have contributed to Social Security can withdraw benefits, with a boost if they elect to begin doing so later in life. You may also have saved up money through tax-advantaged accounts or employer-sponsored savings programs, such as Roth IRAs, traditional IRAs, or 401(k) accounts. Many who work in public service may also be able to rely on pension payments. There is no single best type of income in retirement, as the most financially advantageous source depends on individual needs and circumstances. If you are working after the age of 65, you're far from alone. According to the Pew Research Center, one in five adults over the age of 65 are employed. Older adults aren't just working more, they're also earning more, averaging $22 per hour in 2022 compared to $13 per hour in 1987 (using 2022 dollars). More people are working past retirement age for extra cash, to stay active and challenged, or some combination of reasons. Some switch to new jobs within the career fields where they worked for years. For others, however, a retirement job means trying something entirely new. While the jobs\u00a0listed here are popular among the 65-plus crowd, there are, of course, many other options for older adults, including working as a member of an event staff team (think: music and sport venues), a tour guide/docent, a patient advocate, or an online or in-person tutor.

            "title": "How to Fill Out a Money Order Step-by-Step",
            "content": "SDI Productions / Getty Images Money orders are easy to complete and require the same basic information. Most money orders are from one of three brand names: Western Union, MoneyGram, or the U.S. Postal Service. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on when to use a money order, where to get one, and how to fill it out correctly. When you need to pay someone or someone needs to pay you, but cash, a personal check, or a smartphone app are not available options, a money order might be the solution. Money orders are widely accepted because they are prepaid, eliminating the risk of non-sufficient funds. A money order resembles a check and is more secure than cash because it names a specific recipient, who will have to endorse it and show identification to cash it. Money orders are beneficial for those who don't have a checking account or do not want to accept personal checks. Certified and cashier's checks issued by financial institutions, often for large dollar values, offer more security than money orders but carry much higher fees. Buying a money order typically requires you to visit a location that sells them and leave with a paper money order in hand. U.S. locations that sell money orders, many with evening and weekend hours, include Walmart, CVS, or any of the 31,132 U.S. Postal Service (USPS) retail offices. The U.S. Postal Service carries its brand and format of money orders, as do some banks and credit unions. Other sellers generally offer MoneyGram or Western Union. Whichever type you get, the seller will imprint the date and the amount and then give you the incomplete money order to finalize by hand. Almost all money order purchases involve a fee, so it\u2019s wise to shop around. Walmart charges $1.00 at most locations, and the USPS charges $2.00 to $2.90 depending on the amount. The value limit on money orders is $1,000, but you can order more than one at a time. Write the name of the recipient, the person whom you are paying, in the \u201cpay to\u201d or \u201cpay to the order of\u201d field. Include the person\u2019s name or the name of a business. The \"purchaser\u2019s address\" is the address of the individual who is buying the money order. There may also be an additional address field for the address of the payee. The memo line or field notes what the money order is designated for and if it is paying a certain billing account number. Sign the front of the money order where indicated, but leave the back of the money order blank as this is where the payee will endorse it. This will be helpful if you need to track your payment or prove that payment was made. This will also be needed if you need to replace a money order. You will need to provide valid identification to purchase or cash a money order. Once you've filled in all the fields, be sure to detach the receipt. This stub provides the money order's official identification number, and you can use it to track whether the money order was cashed, and it's also a record of your payment. Now that you have a completed money order in hand and a receipt, you can safely hand deliver the money order or mail it to your recipient and only the recipient will be able to cash it. It's easy to find a place to purchase a money order. You don't need a checking account to purchase or cash a money order. Only the recipient can cash the money order. A money order can only be used for up to $1,000. If you lose or need to cancel your money order, it can take up to 30 days or longer to be reimbursed. Anyone can cash it if you forget to put the recipient's name on the order and lose it. If you need to cancel or replace a money order, immediately contact the entity that issued it to you, and fill out a cancellation request form. Make sure to have your receipt and be prepared to show it. You will need to pay a fee for a canceled money order and you may ask for a replacement money order or a cash refund. You need to put both your address and the recipient's address on a money order. Yes, you do have to write out your signature on a money order. Unfortunately, if you make a mistake, it is hard to correct. If you write out the wrong payee name or misspell it, you may have to ask for a refund, which could take 30 days, according to Western Union. If someone finds a blank money order with a specified value amount on it, it can be filled out and cashed. Only the payee can cash a money order with valid identification. For less than $1,000, money orders can be an easy way to purchase something, pay a bill, or pay back personal debt. You can buy a money order for a small fee at convenience stores, money order businesses, big box stores, and some credit unions and banks. There are drawbacks to using money orders such as a limited amount of money on each order, fees, and a 30-day or more waiting period for a refund on a canceled money order.

            "title": "4 Economic Concepts Consumers Need To Know",
            "content": "Four key economic concepts\u2014scarcity, supply and demand, costs and benefits, and incentives\u2014can help explain many decisions that humans make. While having a basic understanding of economic theory isn't perceived as being as important as balancing a household budget or learning how\u00a0to drive a car, the forces that underpin the study of economics impact every moment of our lives. At the most basic level, economics attempts to explain how and why we make the purchasing choices we do. Everyone has an understanding of scarcity, whether they are aware of it or not, because everyone has experienced the effects of scarcity. Scarcity explains the basic economic problem: the world has limited resources to meet seemingly unlimited wants. This reality forces people to make decisions about how to allocate resources in the most efficient way possible so that as many of their highest priorities as possible are met. For example, there is only so much wheat grown every year. Some people want bread, and some would prefer beer. Only so much of a given good can be\u00a0made because of the scarcity of wheat. How do we decide how much flour should be made for bread and beer? One way to solve this problem is a market system driven by supply and demand. A market system is driven by supply and demand. Taking the example of beer, if many people want to buy beer, the demand for beer is considered high. As a result, you can charge more for beer and make more money on average by using wheat to make beer than by using wheat to make flour. Hypothetically, this could lead to a situation where more people start making beer and, after a few production cycles, there is so much beer on the market\u2014the supply of beer increases\u2014that the price of beer drops. Although this is an extreme and overly simplified example, on a basic level, the concept of supply and demand helps to explain why last year's popular product is half the price the following year. The concept of costs and benefits is related to the theory of rational choice (and rational expectations) that economics is based on. When economists say that people behave rationally, they mean that people try to maximize the ratio of benefits to costs in their decisions. If demand for beer is high, breweries will hire more employees to make more beer, but only if the price of beer and the amount of beer they are selling justify the additional costs of their salary and the materials needed to brew more beer. Similarly, the consumer will buy the best beer they can afford to purchase, but not, perhaps, the best-tasting beer in the store. The concept of costs and benefits is applicable to other decisions that are not related to financial transactions. University students perform cost-benefit analyses on a daily basis by choosing to focus on certain courses that they've deemed more important for their success. Sometimes this even means cutting the time they spend studying for courses that they see as less necessary. Although economics assumes that people are generally rational, many of the decisions that humans make are actually very emotional and do not maximize our own benefit. For example, the field of advertising preys on the tendency of humans to act non-rationally. Commercials try to activate the emotional centers of our brain and fool us into overestimating the benefits of a given item. If you are a parent, a boss, a teacher, or anyone with the responsibility of oversight, you've probably been in the situation of offering a reward\u2014or incentive\u2014in order to increase the likelihood of a particular outcome. Economic incentives explain how the operation of supply and demand encourages producers to supply the goods that consumers want, and consumers to conserve on scarce resources. When consumer demand for a good increases, then the market price of the good rises, and producers have an incentive to produce more of the good because they can receive a higher price. On the other hand, when the increasing scarcity of raw materials or inputs for a given good drives costs up and producers to cut back on supply, then the price they charge for the good rises, and consumers have an incentive to conserve on their consumption of that good and reserve its use for their most highly valued uses. In the example of a brewery, the owner wants to increase production so they decide to offer an incentive\u2014a bonus\u2014to the shift that produces the most bottles of beer in a day. The brewery has two sizes of bottles: one 500-milliliter bottle and a one-liter bottle. Within a couple of days, they see production numbers shoot up from 10,000 to 15,000 bottles per day. The problem is that the incentive they provided focused on the wrong thing\u2014the number of bottles rather than the volume of beer. They begin receiving calls from suppliers wondering when orders of the one-liter bottles are going to come. By offering a bonus for the number of bottles produced, the owner made it beneficial for the competing shifts to gain an advantage by only bottling the smaller bottles. When incentives are correctly aligned with organizational goals the benefits can be exceptional. These practices include profit sharing, performance bonuses, and employee stock ownership. However, these incentives can go awry if the criteria for determining if an incentive has been met fall out of alignment with the original goal. For example, poorly structured performance bonuses have driven some executives to take measures that improve the financial results of the company in the short term\u2014just enough to get the bonus. In the long term, these measures have then proven detrimental to the health of the company. Scarcity is what underpins all of economics, which is one interpretation of why economics is sometimes referred to as the dismal science. Humans are constantly making choices that are determined by their costs and benefits. On a personal level, scarcity means that we have to make choices based on the incentives we are given according to different courses of action. On a market level, the impact of millions of people making choices creates the forces of supply and demand. Otamendi, F.

            "title": "How Much Rent Can You Afford on $50K a Year?",
            "content": "Lea Uradu, J.D. is a Maryland State Registered Tax Preparer, State Certified Notary\u00a0Public, Certified VITA Tax Preparer, IRS Annual Filing Season Program Participant, and Tax Writer. The rent you can afford on a salary of $50,000\u2014or any salary, for that matter\u2014is not the same as the amount for which you qualify. Qualification is often based on a rule of thumb, such as the \u201c40 times rent\u201d rule, which\u00a0says that to be able to pay a certain rent, your annual salary\u00a0needs to be 40 times that amount. In this case, 40 times $1,250 is $50,000. Therefore, if you make $50,000, you qualify for $1,250 per month in rent. One drawback to this formula is that the calculation uses gross income\u2014your income before taxes and other deductions. Although you make $50,000 a year, the amount you have to spend\u2014your take-home\u00a0pay\u2014is less. Another issue with the \u201c40 times rent\u201d rule is that it is a general rule and doesn\u2019t\u00a0take into consideration your\u00a0particular financial situation. It doesn\u2019t calculate your expenses. Instead, it simply assumes that if you spend one-fortieth\u00a0of your salary on rent, what\u2019s left will be enough to pay all your other bills and obligations. Mortgage lending discrimination is illegal. If you think you've been discriminated against based on race, religion, sex, marital status, use of public assistance, national origin, disability, or age, there are steps you can take. One such step is to file a report to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). A slightly more realistic guideline suggests spending 30%\u00a0of your take-home pay on rent. This rule allows for taxes, retirement, and other deductions before arriving at a rent figure. On your $50,000 salary, if your monthly take-home pay is $3,500, for example, your monthly rent should not exceed $1,050. There\u2019s still the issue of your specific expenses. For that you need a budget, especially considering that $50,000 may not go too far if the cost of living is high where you hope to find an apartment. The \"40 times rent\" rule says your salary should be 40 times your monthly rent, but this fails to account for taxes, and for the specifics of your financial situation. A better bet is the \"30% rent\" guideline or an approach based on your budget. The best way to determine how much rent you can afford is to add up your actual monthly expenses and subtract them from your monthly take-home pay. This budget-based approach takes more time, but it is more accurate and helps you avoid unpleasant surprises, such as running out of money and finding that you can\u2019t\u00a0pay one or more bills. Start with utilities, such as water, sewer, trash, electricity, oil, and gas. Water, sewer, and trash are often included in rent but not always. Other utility costs include cable, internet, telephone, and even security and maintenance in some apartment complexes. The cost of electricity and oil and gas can vary depending on the age and condition of the apartment. A well-insulated apartment, for example, will cost less to heat. The best way to determine the likely cost of utilities in a new apartment is to ask the landlord or several current residents. This category includes groceries, cleaning supplies, paper towels, and other items that you use and replace on a regular basis. If you already have a grocery budget, use that as your basis. If you are moving out on your own for the first time, establishing a grocery and supplies budget isn\u2019t difficult or time-consuming. An hour a week should be plenty of time to plan meals, and the savings can add up. Your monthly car payment, gasoline, oil, and maintenance will make up most of your transportation budget. Include parking and tolls if they are a regular expense for you. If you rely on public transportation, use those costs instead. If you own and use a car and also use public transportation, include both. You must account for debt payments, such as student loans and revolving (credit card) debt, as part of your budget. Keep in mind that the more you can pay, especially on revolving credit, the faster the balance will come down. Don\u2019t just pay the minimum due unless you have no other choice. Renter's insurance protects your personal belongings from loss or theft and provides liability protection in the event you are sued because someone is injured on or in the property you rent. These protections are not provided by your landlord. Contributions to a company-sponsored 401(k) or retirement plan will be deducted before you are paid and do not have to be counted. Any savings that come out of your take-home pay, however, do. Clothing, dining out, gym membership, and hobbies are just a few things that fall under this miscellaneous or discretionary-spending category. It\u2019s the most flexible part of your budget and can be scaled down or even eliminated as needed. Subtract your monthly budget total from your monthly take-home pay, and the amount left is the most you should pay for rent\u2014what you can realistically afford. If the amount is too small for available apartments in your area, take a hard look at your discretionary spending first and other categories as needed. You may also need to weigh the options of moving to a less expensive locale or sharing an apartment with roommates. In many communities, a salary of $50,000 or even $100,000 may not stretch too far, especially if you live in a pricey city or have student loans or other debts to pay off. Apartment search sites, such as apartments.com and rentable.co, can help you find available apartments in your price range. You may want to check out these sites before you create your budget, just to get an idea of what your goal needs to be. One important final factor has to do with your personal priorities. If investing for retirement is a high priority\u2014or saving up for a new car or travel is important\u2014you may want to scale down your expectations for a place to live and put more funds into what matters to you more.

            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. Caveat emptor is a Latin phrase that translates to \"let the buyer beware.\" It means that an individual buys at their own risk. Potential buyers are warned by the phrase to do their research and ask pointed questions of the seller. The seller isn't responsible for problems that the buyer encounters with the product after the sale. Caveat emptor is sometimes used in legal contracts as a type of disclaimer. In many jurisdictions, it is the contract law principle that places the onus on the buyer to perform due diligence before making a purchase. The term is commonly used in real property transactions. It relates to adverse situations that may arise with real estate after the date of closing. It also applies to transactions that involve other types of goods, such as cars or items at thrift stores or yard sales. Investopedia / Jake Shi Caveat emptor is intended to preclude post-purchase disputes arising from\u00a0information asymmetry, a situation in which the seller has more information than the buyer about the quality of a good or service. For example, if Hasan\u00a0wants to buy a car from Allison, and caveat emptor applies, he is responsible for gathering the necessary information to make an informed purchase. In gathering this information, Hassan may decide to ask Allison how many miles the car has on it, whether any major components need to be replaced, whether it's been serviced regularly, and more. If he buys the car for the asking price, making little or no effort to assess its true condition or value, and the car subsequently breaks down, Allison is not technically liable for damages. However, in practice, there are exceptions to this principle. Caveat emptor doesn't give sellers carte blanche to promote a fraudulent transaction. For example, if Allison lied about the car's mileage, maintenance history, or repair needs, she would have committed fraud. In theory, Hasan would be entitled to damages. Caveat emptor can apply in real estate\u00a0transactions involving previously owned houses in all U.S. states. Therefore, buyers need to make every effort to discover any and all property defects. They might hire a highly rated house inspector to help. However, in the majority of states, this principle is not necessarily business as usual. What's more, within the U.S., home builders are required to issue an implied warranty of fitness to buyers of new properties. These properties come with the expectation that the seller is liable for faults. Market forces and other factors can reduce the feasibility of caveat emptor in some cases. For example, with real estate, because a seller typically knows the condition of a property better than a buyer, legal decisions relating to quality issues have begun to favor the buyers. There are other ways that buyers can feel more assured of quality. Warranties are guarantees of quality or satisfaction that sellers issue voluntarily to buyers. If sellers provide a quality product, they will not need to provide refunds or replacements very often. Buyers will be inclined to choose those vendors that provide a perception of quality or a warranty. There are several types of implied warranties: These laws have been enacted for the protection of consumers buying certain goods and services, especially since the 2008 financial crisis. For instance, financial services institutions know much more information about their products and services than their customers do. This information can relate to fees, responsibilities, risks, and benefits. The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) requires financial services providers to inform consumers of the terms and costs of consumer credit products. Informal transactions such as the one between Allison and Hasan\u00a0are usually unregulated. However, the U.S. government pushes back against the principle of caveat emptor to protect consumers' interests in more than just the financial services industry, as referred to above. Many other industries must provide buyers clear, largely standardized information about a product or service. At the same time, safe harbor statements and legally mandated quarterly reports can reinforce the principle of caveat emptor. Many companies continue to promote the expectation that buyers have access to all the information they need to make a reasonably informed decision. If you see the term \"as is\" on the tag of any item for sale, caveat emptor applies. Be sure to examine the item carefully and to your satisfaction. Ask the seller questions about condition. Once you buy it, you cannot return it for a refund. Most states don't uniformly apply caveat emptor, offering buyers some assurance of product/service protection. However, the courts in the states below still tend to uphold it for real estate transactions. Caveat emptor refers to instances when buyers must be vigilant about researching the condition of an item for sale. The seller has no responsibility for after-sale problems that occur. However, a different phrase often applies to sales in the U.S. nowadays. It's caveat venditor and it translates to \"let the seller beware.\" Times have changed and goods and services are often covered by an\u00a0implied warranty. Unless they're labeled \"sold as is\" or some other understanding between the buyer and seller is reached, most consumer products are guaranteed to function when used for their intended purpose. Caveat emptor is a Latin phrase that means that buyers are responsible for making sure that a product works to their satisfaction before buying it. They must be confident about the product because the seller will be under no obligation to provide a refund for it. Caveat emptor isn't necessarily wrong. It's just that it puts too heavy a burden on ordinary consumers to understand the intricacies of certain complex products and services. For example, most of those offered by financial institutions or tech companies can't be readily understood or even researched appropriately by the majority of individuals. Many people accept the principle of caveat emptor where items sold in thrift shops and garage sales are concerned. They understand that a seller in such circumstances might not know the true condition of a product that has been used or owned many times over by the time the seller obtained it. In general, caveat venditor has replaced caveat emptor. It means that sellers now need to be sure that their products and services function as advertised. Unless they're told otherwise, buyers expect that items have an implied warranty and can be returned for a refund. Caveat emptor is a Latin phrase that translates to \u201clet the buyer beware.\u201d In use for hundreds of years in the U.S., it puts the burden of researching the quality of products and services on the buyer in a transaction. It's often used when selling previously owned real estate. These days, caveat emptor isn't applied very often to other types of transactions. That's due to regulations that are intended to provide consumers with more information and protection. It's more likely that caveat venditor, or \"let the seller beware,\" applies.

Enter the amount you want in each category for a more accurate snapshot of your finances. Entering your transactions manually allows users to track their cash spend. For this trick, make sure the drop-down menu says \u201ccash\u201d and Mint will automatically deduct the amount from your last ATM withdrawal so it is not deducted from your cash balance twice. Mint users can customize an array of notifications to meet their needs. You can set daily, weekly, or monthly notices when you go over budget when your credit score changes or when you incur an unusual amount of fees. You can also set the notices so they send to another person as well, such as a spouse. Aside from categories, a tags feature allows users to see their finances organized in another way. For example, you can layer another label like \u201cfixed expenses\u201d onto the categories to see what percentage you are allotting to fixed expenses like monthly bills.

He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. The old saying that it takes money to make money is true. For those living paycheck to paycheck, there often isn't enough money left over to put toward investing. When you need the money now, finding a broker for an individual retirement account (IRA) and investing in the stock market might be far down on your priority list. However, by reading this article and gaining knowledge, you are taking one of the necessary first steps in building a retirement nest egg. The fact remains that you must put money away for later years or face a possible catastrophic situation. Someday, you won't be able to work and Social Security won't be enough to live on\u2014assuming the fund is around in 20 or 30 years. You can start investing now with less money than you think it will take. First, we have to solve the problem of limited funds and the advice isn't new or revolutionary. Something in your life has to go, but it doesn't have to be a big life change. Simple changes that save $1 here and $5 there can add up to make a big impact. We've put together a few ideas for those people who don't see any available funds for investing. As with anything else, make sure you consult a financial professional about your investment options. This is especially important if you're trying to juggle saving while paying off your debts. Dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPS) allow you to invest small amounts of money into a dividend-paying stock, by purchasing directly from the company. Companies like GE, Coca-Cola, Verizon, Home Depot, and Johnson & Johnson are just a few of the companies that allow you to make regular purchases of very small amounts of stock, and reinvest the dividends. This can add up to a big investment over time and, as you gain a larger balance, you may consider diverting some of these funds into other investments. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are financial products that track the performance of a certain sector of the investment market. You can buy as little as one share of an ETF through a broker, and some of these ETFs track the performance of the total stock market, the bond market, and many others. Many ETFs also pay a dividend, so purchasing a fund like the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) will bring exposure to an instantly diversified portfolio that also pays a dividend. Target-date funds, as the name implies, target your retirement date by changing the percentage of stocks and bonds to ensure that your money remains safe as you approach retirement age. Some of these funds require a minimum investment of $1,000, but they may serve as great products for investors who don't want to manage their portfolios on their own. But make sure you use caution when picking a target-date fund because of the high fees that some of these vehicles charge. The 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that allows you to put away a portion of your paycheck into an investment account. The plan comes with tax savings depending on the type of plan you have: If you have a 401(k) that will match your contributions, invest there first. Since your company is giving you free money to invest, you should consider funding your 401(k) before outside investments. If you have some money saved or invested, you want to see it grow over time. Many factors can prevent this from happening. Debt is one of the biggest obstacles for some people. If you have a sizable amount of debt to deal with, whether it's a mortgage, line of credit (LOC), student loan, or credit card, you can still learn how to balance your debt with saving and investing. Having debt can make it very difficult for investors to make money. In some cases, investing while in debt is like trying to bail out a sinking ship with a coffee cup. For instance, if you owe money on a LOC with 7%\u00a0interest, the money you put aside will have to make more than 7% (after taxes and fees) to make it more profitable than paying down the debt. Some investments deliver such high returns, but you have to be able to find them, knowing you are under the burden of debt. It is important to briefly distinguish between the different kinds of debt that\u00a0may be incurred. High interest is relative, but anything above 10%\u00a0is a good candidate for this category. Having said that, you can probably count your credit card as a high-interest debt. Carrying any kind of balance on your credit card or similar high-interest vehicle makes paying it down a priority before starting to invest. This type of low-interest debt\u00a0may often\u00a0be a car loan, a line of credit, or a personal loan from a bank. The interest rates are usually described as a prime plus or minus a certain percentage, so there is still some performance pressure from investing with this type of debt. It is, however, much less daunting to make a portfolio that returns 12%\u00a0than one that has to return 25%. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that your credit score determines your interest rate. The better your score, the lower your rate. But if you have a less-than-stellar credit history, the chance of obtaining a low-interest loan may be small. If there is such a thing as good debt, this is it. Tax-deductible debts include mortgages, student loans, business loans, investment loans, and all the other loans in which interest paid is returned to you in the form of tax deductions. Since this debt is generally low interest as well, you can easily build a portfolio while paying it down. The types of debt we focus on here are long-term low-interest and tax-deductible debt, such as mortgage payments. If you do have high-interest debt, you'll likely want\u00a0to focus on\u00a0paying it off before you begin your investing adventure. Not all interest-bearing loans are tax-deductible. Be sure to check with your lender or a financial professional whether you can deduct the interest on your loan. Debt elimination, particularly of something like a loan that will take long-term capital, robs you of time and money. In the long term, the time (in terms of the\u00a0compounding time of your investment) that you lose is worth more to you than the money you actually pay (in terms of the money and interest that you are paying to your lender). You want to give your money as much time as possible to compound. This is one of the reasons to start a portfolio despite carrying debt, but not the only one. Your investments may be small, but they will pay off more than investments you would make later in life because these small investments will have more time to mature. Instead of making a traditional portfolio with high- and low-risk investments that are adjusted according to your tolerance and age, the idea is to make your loan payments in place of low-risk and/or fixed-income investments. This means that you will be seeing returns from decreasing your debt load and interest payments rather than the 2% to 8%\u00a0return on a bond or similar investment. The rest of your portfolio should focus on higher-risk, high-return investments like stocks. If your risk tolerance is very low, the bulk of your investing money will still be going toward loan payments, but there will be a percentage that does make it into the market to produce returns for you. Even if you have a high-risk tolerance, you may not be able to put as much as you'd like into your investment portfolio because, unlike bonds, loans require a certain amount in monthly payments. Your debt load may force you to create a conservative portfolio with\u00a0most of your money being invested in your loans and\u00a0only a little going into your high-risk and return investments. As the debt gets smaller, you can adjust your distributions accordingly. Before you start investing, it is wise to have your finances in as much order as possible. The first step would be to save up cash in an emergency fund, usually three to six months of your salary. The next would be to start paying down high-interest debt, such as credit card debt. Once that is resolved, it is wise to start putting money in a retirement plan, such as a 401(k) at work or an IRA. This should be a monthly contribution and is investing. From there, you can start investing outside of retirement plans, even if it is a small amount of money. A simple way to start investing is to choose an ETF, such as one that tracks the S&P 500, which will give you exposure to the broad market. You do not need a lot of money to start investing. You can start investing in a retirement plan with any amount of money. If you have a 401(k) at work or your own IRA, putting any amount of money into the accounts will count as investing. If you want to invest in the stock market, having enough money to buy one share of a company's stock that you like will also be enough to get you started. A beginner should start investing with contributions to a retirement plan. They should then choose index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A good way to start is also by choosing a robo-advisor that will make investment decisions for you based on the criteria you decide. You can invest despite debt. The important question is whether or not you should. The answer to this question is personalized to your financial situation and risk tolerance. There are certainly\u00a0benefits from getting your money into the market as soon as possible, but there is also no guarantee that your portfolio will perform as expected. These things depend on your\u00a0investing strategy and market timing. The biggest benefit of investing while in debt is psychological. Paying down long-term debts can be tedious and disheartening if you are not the type of person who puts your shoulder into a task and keeps pushing until it is done. For many people who are servicing debt, it seems like they are struggling to get to the point where their regular financial life\u2014that of saving and investing\u2014can begin. Debt becomes like a limbo state where things seem to be happening in slow motion. By having even a modest portfolio to track, you can keep your enthusiasm about the growth of your personal\u00a0finances from ebbing. For some people, building a portfolio while in debt provides a much-needed ray of light.

            "title": "The Worst Places to Exchange Currency",
            "content": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University. Traveling abroad is a fun, exciting experience where you can take in history, new cultures, exotic cuisine, and learn about the world. Nevertheless, when you travel, you often can\u2019t use the U.S. dollar. Getting foreign currency can be easy, but you need to be careful about where you exchange your dollars so you aren\u2019t stuck with a bad exchange rate. Knowing the best place to exchange currency makes it far more likely you won't end up in the worst place. The process of currency exchange involves swapping one country's currency for that of another by executing buy- and sell-transactions. The value of one currency relative to another is determined by the international\u00a0spot rate \u2014 essentially a daily value established by a group of banks that trade currencies. Foreign exchange rates are always fluctuating because the global economy is active 24 hours per day. As economies strengthen and weaken, currencies experience inflation and deflation, and trade deficits grow and shrink. As a result, the relative value between currencies moves up and down. Financial institutions, investors, and speculators are constantly buying and selling large lots of currencies, which creates the current market exchange rate between two currencies. In general, currency exchange rates are quoted against the U.S. dollar, pound sterling, euro, and Swiss franc as those are the most stable and widely used currencies for large business transactions. When you travel abroad and want to buy something in the local currency, you typically exchange a relatively small amount of currency and pay a higher exchange rate so the currency exchange can earn a small profit. Not all currency exchanges charge the same rate, and some businesses take advantage of needy travelers in areas flush with tourists to turn a profit. Exchange rates vary based on the day and on where you get your money. If you exchange your money at a currency exchange, you'll pay a premium on the international spot rate, as that's how the store makes a profit. If you exchange your money through a bank or by withdrawing the local currency from an ATM, you'll likely come out ahead, even if there are ATM or credit card fees. The first place nearly all travelers arrive in a new country is the airport terminal, and that is the first place where you will have an opportunity to exchange currency. The airport currency exchange rate isn't always the best. Why? Because airport-based currency exchange shops know that you might need local currency to catch a bus, train, or taxi, so they make big profits by offering you the worst exchange rate. Avoid these currency exchanges if possible by getting currency in advance from a local bank or going to an in-airport bank or ATM. Many credit cards do not charge an extra foreign exchange fee, and you will get your bank\u2019s rate if you use your credit card for a purchase. Once you get out of the airport, you may find yourself in a market, bazaar or popular tourist area. Exchange shops try to operate where you will need them and take advantage of tourists to make a profit. You will probably find better rates than the airport at a dedicated currency exchange. However, even though the rates are better, you\u2019re still likely to get a bad deal. The best place to exchange money is a local ATM or a bank. Many foreign banks are happy to exchange your dollars for local currency for a better rate than you find elsewhere, or you can go to an ATM to skip the line. Many U.S. banks offer foreign ATM fee refunds and charge no fees for using a foreign ATM, so if you need cash you just whip out your debit card, find the closest bank ATM\u2014not an ATM kiosk in a mall or supermarket\u2014and rest easy knowing you received the best rate for your dollars. It is cheaper to exchange money at the bank (or by using an ATM) than the airport. That's because currency\u00a0exchange stores and kiosks at the airports mark up the exchange rate to make a profit. They know that travelers who just got off a plane probably need money right away. Banks and ATMs often charge fees, but the fees will be less than the airport mark-up. Generally, local banks or credit unions offer the best rates for currency exchange. Additionally, major banks typically have a\u00a0number of overseas ATMs available for use, meaning they are an easily accessible option for travelers. A traveler can choose to pay for everything with a credit card, assuming the credit card is accepted at all places in a\u00a0country that they are visiting. A credit card may not be accepted everywhere in some countries, or in some smaller cities or rural areas. Before you leave, you should contact your bank and credit card provider. A visitor should keep in mind that there will likely be foreign transaction fees accrued as a result of using the card overseas. There are also traveler's checks, but those have fallen out of favor in recent years due to\u00a0the popularity of credit cards. If you keep your eyes open, most major international cities have banks all over the central business district, bustling neighborhoods, and even in the airport. In the U.S. major international cities include Chicago, New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miama, and Seattle. Even if you have to pay a small ATM fee, you can easily make up for the bad exchange rate you\u2019ll find at the airport or a currency exchange store if you get enough cash. If you follow that plan, you can enjoy your travels and focus on the fun parts rather than stressing about getting ripped off on currency exchange.

            "title": "Personal Income Definition & Difference From Disposable Income",
            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. Personal income refers to all income collectively received by all individuals or households in a country. Personal income includes compensation from a number of sources, including salaries, wages, and bonuses received from employment or self-employment, dividends and distributions received from investments, rental receipts from real estate investments, and profit sharing from businesses. The term\u00a0\u201cpersonal income\u201d is sometimes used to refer to the total compensation received by an individual, but this is more aptly referred to as individual income.\u00a0In most jurisdictions, personal income, also called gross income, is subject to taxation above a certain base amount. Personal income has a significant effect on consumer consumption.\u00a0As consumer spending drives much of the economy, national statistical organizations, economists, and analysts track personal income on a quarterly or annual basis. In the United States, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) tracks personal income statistics each month and compares them to numbers from the previous month. The\u00a0agency also breaks out the numbers into categories, such as personal income earned through employment wages, rental income, farming, and sole proprietorships. This allows the agency to make analyses\u00a0about how earning trends are changing. Personal income tends to rise during periods of economic expansion and stagnate or decline slightly during recessionary times. Rapid economic growth since the 1980s in economies such as China, India, and Brazil has spurred substantial increases in personal incomes for millions of their citizens. Disposable personal income (DPI) refers to the amount of money that a population has left after taxes have been paid. It differs from personal income in that it takes taxes into account. Analyzing after-tax income is important, as this is the money that the population is effectively left with to spend, save, or invest. Only income taxes are removed from the personal income figure when calculating disposable personal income. Personal income is often compared to personal consumption expenditures (PCEs). PCEs measure changes in the price of consumer goods and services. By taking these changes into account, analysts can ascertain how changes in personal income affect spending. To illustrate, if personal income increases significantly one month, and PCEs also increase, consumers collectively may have more cash in their pockets but also may have to spend more money on basic goods and services. Personal income represents all payments made to individuals before tax. It\u2019s not disposable income, which reveals how much people actually have left to spend, save, or invest after income taxes have been deducted. To calculate personal income, all income collectively received by individuals or households in a country needs to be tallied up. That is not only gross pay from work but also dividends, rental income, interest, and so forth. Disposable income is then calculated by taking the personal income number and subtracting personal income taxes. Personal income focuses on how much money a country\u2019s inhabitants are earning. Gross national income (GNI), on the other hand, reveals the total amount of money earned by a nation\u2019s residents and businesses.

            "title": "What Is Discretionary Income? Vs. Disposable Income and Example",
            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. Discretionary income is the amount of money that you have left for spending, investing, or saving after you've paid your taxes and paid for personal necessities, which include food, housing, and clothing\u2014so-called non-discretionary expenses. Discretionary income includes money spent on luxury items, vacations, and nonessential goods and services. Because discretionary income is the first to shrink after a job loss or pay reduction, businesses that sell discretionary goods tend to suffer the most during economic downturns and recessions. Discretionary spending is an important part of a healthy economy. People only spend money on things like travel, movies, and consumer electronics if they have the funds to do so. While non-discretionary expenses are considered mandatory\u2014housing, taxes, debt, and groceries\u2014discretionary expenses are any costs incurred above and beyond what is deemed necessary. These are generally considered wants, while non-discretionary expenses are usually referred to as needs. As such, discretionary expenses rarely have anything to do with a business or household's day-to-day operations and, instead, have to do with lifestyle and choice. Businesses and individuals pay for discretionary expenses with\u00a0discretionary income\u2014the amount of money left over after paying for housing, food, taxes, and other necessities. When times are good, people have more money to spend, and they normally do so on things they don't need, such as luxury items and other services\u2014vacations, restaurants, entertainment, electronics, gym memberships, etc. Discretionary income and disposable income are terms often used interchangeably, but they refer to different types of income. Discretionary income is derived from disposable income, which equals gross income minus taxes. Disposable income is a person's take-home pay, which is used to meet both essential and nonessential expenses. This income is what is left over after taxes and it is the amount of net income available to spend, save, or invest. By contrast, discretionary income is what is leftover from disposable income after an income-earner pays for rent/mortgage, transportation, food, utilities, insurance, and other essential costs out of their disposable income. For most consumers, discretionary income gets depleted first when a pay cut happens. Let's say, for example, Elise makes $4,000 per month after taxes and has $2,000 in essential costs, leaving her $2,000 in monthly discretionary income. If Elise's paycheck gets cut to $3,000 per month, she will still be able to meet her essential costs but she will have only $1,000 left over in discretionary income. Discretionary income is an important marker of economic health. Economists use it, along with disposable income, to derive other important economic ratios, such as the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), the marginal propensity to save (MPS), and consumer leverage ratios. In 2005, in the midst of a debt-fueled economic bubble, the U.S. personal savings rate went negative for four consecutive months. After paying for necessary expenses out of disposable income, the average consumer spent all of their discretionary income and then some, using credit cards and other debt instruments to make additional discretionary purchases beyond what they could afford. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread lockdowns that resulted, the personal savings rate in the U.S. reached all-time highs of more than 30% for several months. From the end of 2021 into 2022, the rate moderated to around 7%, more in line with the long-term average, and has since dropped to 3.4% as of June 2024. Aggregate discretionary income levels for an economy fluctuate over time, typically in line with business cycle activity. When economic output is strong, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP) or another gross measure, discretionary income levels tend to be high as well. If inflation occurs in the price of life's necessities, then discretionary income falls, assuming that wages and taxes remain relatively constant. Discretionary income is a subset of disposable income, or part of all the income left over after you pay taxes. From disposable income, deduct all necessities and obligations like rent or mortgage, utilities, loans, car payments, and food. Once you've paid all of those items, whatever is left to save, spend, or invest is your discretionary income. This is somewhat a matter of lifestyle; however, many experts agree that around 10-30% of your take-home (after-tax) pay should consist of discretionary income. The so-called 50-20-30 rule suggests that 50% of your net income should go towards living expenses, 20% to savings or investments, and 30% to discretionary spending. If you are looking at federal student loans or student loan repayment plans, the U.S. government will calculate your eligibility based on discretionary income. However, the government defines discretionary income as your annual gross after-tax income less than 100% to 225% of the federal poverty line (which will depend on your state and family size and the repayment plan you choose) and takes into account any subsequent rise or fall in your income. Discretionary income is money left over after a person pays their taxes and pays for essential goods and services like housing and food. Nonessential items like vacations and luxury goods are usually paid for with funds from discretionary income. Discretionary income is used by economists to measure economic health. Disposable income and discretionary income are two different things. Disposable income is the net income of a person's take-home pay and is used to cover all expenses (both essential and non-essential).

            "title": "Money Habits of the Millennial Generation",
            "content": "The millennial generation, the largest in U.S. history, encompasses those born from 1981 to 1996, and they distinctly differ from older generations\u2014even when it comes to their finances. Millennials are more racially diverse, more educated, and more internet savvy. This generation experienced 9/11, the 2008 market crash, and the COVID-19 pandemic. They have also experienced severe real estate and stock market fluctuations, and they carry large student loan debt balances. Perhaps influenced by these experiences, their outlook and behaviors tend to differ greatly from the generations before them.\u00a0Millennials, now 28 to 43 years old, tend to be more value-oriented than previous generations. Social issues like sustainability also impact their spending. However, while their interests may differ from those of previous generations, they share many of the same concerns that older generations had regarding growing their careers and families. Here are ways that millennials\u2019 experiences have shaped their spending and saving habits. Millennials have had uniquely difficult financial experiences. The 2008 financial crisis, which struck when they were in their teens to late 20s, hit them especially hard: A 2019 paper found that the average millennial lost about 13% of their earnings during the 2008 recession. Research also reveals that the net worth of millennials born in the 1980s is 34% lower than expected due to economic recessions, evidence that world events have likely shaped this generation\u2019s spending habits. A 2022 retirement readiness survey from Goldman Sachs found that overall, millennials expect to retire during ages 60 to 64, but 34% of the generation feel they are behind with their savings. Currently, the saving rate of millennials is 9.7%. Yet, 46% of millennials believe they will not be financially prepared for retirement when the time comes. While baby boomers are expected to need just under $1 million saved to retire, millennials may need more like $1.44 million, according to research from Northwestern Mutual. One reason why millennials are behind on saving for retirement is debt. They have a growing debt load\u2014currently owing about $1 trillion. Their debt crisis has been spurred by attending four-year universities and a lack of consistent education about loans and interest, which made it easy for many millennials to take on excessive student debt. The average millennial student loan borrower owes $32,800. Author and financial educator Berna Anat is concerned that millennials considering college are not being adequately informed about long-term debt that has terms \u201cthat end up trapping people for 20 to 30 years after you take out the loan,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re just sort of rushing these 17- to 18-year-olds into some of the biggest and most serious, most long-term financial relationships that they\u2019ll ever have.\u201d The average millennial has $6,521 in credit card debt, according to Experian. Altogether, millennials are carrying an average of $125,047 in debt. \u201cThe continued rise in credit card delinquency rates is broad-based across area income and region, but particularly pronounced among millennials and those with auto loans or student loans,\u201d Donghoon Lee, an economic research advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a press release. Despite millennials\u2019 debt, they have a reputation for being high spenders and a stereotype of being indulgent and reckless with their finances. It has been more than a decade since Time Magazine published the notorious cover story, \u201cMillennials: The Me Me Me Generation.\u201d Since then, those referenced teens and 20-somethings have entered a fundamentally different workforce, housing market, and financial ecosystem than any generation before them. Danetha Doe, a millennial founder of the financial education company Money & Mimosas, believes the stereotype is inaccurate. \u201cThe truth is that the cost of living has greatly outpaced the increase in earnings. Since 2000, the price of goods has increased 67%, while earnings have increased a total of 7%, or a mere 0.3% per year since 2000,\u201d she says. The amount of money it takes for millennials to get an education, buy a house, and own a car is significantly higher compared to their parents\u2019 generation. For example, millennials are paying 100% more on average for homes than their parents\u2019 generation, the baby boomers, did in the 1970s. A 2023 Deloitte study found that more than half of millennials think buying a house will become harder or impossible in the coming years. Millennials spend an average of $85 a day, accounting for 28% of all daily per-person consumer spending in the United States. This number is expected to climb as high as 35% over the next 15 years. Their top three spending categories are housing, healthcare, and personal insurance, much like the generations before them. As the first generation raised on the internet, millennials lead the pack in online purchases. With both convenience and price in mind, this generation uses online shopping to broaden their options and turns to reviews and testimonials when making a purchase. Many millennials focus on purchasing sustainable, cruelty-free, or vegan items instead of opting for the goods with the lowest price or absolute best rating. A 2020 study by the IBM Institute for Business Value found that 79% of millennials cite sustainability as important to them. \u201cI make a conscious effort to purchase products from brands and small businesses that align with my values. I also extend this practice to my investment choices,\u201d says Doe. Millennials are paying off the past and saving for the future simultaneously. Sixty-four percent of millennials are invested, with the most favorable form being crypto, according to a 2022 Investopedia study. In 2022, one in three millennials were invested in crypto, with the next most popular being stocks. The same Investopedia survey found that most millennial investors are confident: 65% said they are doing an \u201cabove average\u201d job managing their portfolio. Still, even amid their financial confidence, millennials express wariness toward taking risks. For example, the same Investopedia survey found that 37% of millennial investors would classify their portfolios as \u201clower-risk\u201d investments. \u201cSetting and tracking financial goals can help you become more intentional, especially for millennials who are looking to take the next step for major, expensive life milestones like a wedding or purchasing their first home,\u201d says Michael Liersch, head of advice and planning at Wells Fargo. When it comes to saving and investing, there are a few strategies to employ. As a rule of thumb, one should aspire to follow the 50/30/20 framework. This framework states that you should allot half of your paycheck for basic necessities like housing, utilities, monthly minimum payments, and groceries; 30% on things you want, such as clothing, subscriptions, gym memberships, etc.; and the final 20% into savings. \u201cHaving money set aside for the unexpected provides both literal and psychological safety. If you don\u2019t have money in an emergency fund, don\u2019t worry\u2014you can start with any amount of money,\u201d Liersch says. \u201cFor example, if you set aside $100 a month, in a few short months, you may have more than most Americans have saved for an emergency, which is an enormous accomplishment! And if you did it for the year, you\u2019d have well over $1,000, which can give you peace of mind that the next flat tire, electrical problem in your house, lost phone, or whatever else it might be won\u2019t set you back too far, financially speaking.\u201d Many are turning to high-yield savings accounts to offset the effects of inflation. These accounts function similarly to a standard savings account, but with significantly higher interest rates. Roth individual retirement accounts (Roth IRAs) are also a great option for longer-term saving for retirement. For those offered a 401(k) package through their employer, they should aspire to maximize their contributions and utilize any employer matching. Automatic contributions are one way to ensure that part of your earnings are put into savings every paycheck, plus it\u2019s saved pretax. Though life experiences and debt burdens have left many millennials stressed about the future, the 2022 Investopedia Financial Literacy Survey found them to be the most confident when it came to investing. Some 64% of millennials are invested, namely in cryptocurrency and stocks, according to Investopedia\u2019s research. \u201cThe point of becoming financially competent and financially empowered is to be able to move your money in the way that you want,\u201d Anat says. \u201cAnd that can be to lavish yourself and your loved ones with time and privilege and comfort. It could also be to use your money in ways that are important to you in terms of changing the world. That\u2019s what really drives me is when to get my head above water to go beyond survival, beyond scarcity, and to be financially stable, but also financially free.\u201d If you\u2019re a millennial with your eyes on retirement or seeking to further your financial knowledge, there are more resources here to help support your financial future. There are roughly 72.2 million millennials in the U.S., according to the most recent Census Bureau data. This makes them the largest generation currently alive in the U.S. Comparatively, baby boomers, who are 59 to 77 years old in 2024, numbered 71.6 million. Gen X, who are 43 to 59 years old in 2024, clocked in at 65.2 million. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the median millennial household pretax income was $71,566 in 2020. Investing in the stock market, using ladder certificates of deposit (ladder CDs), or opening a high-yield savings account are all great ways for millennials (or other curious investors) to grow their money. Additionally, utilizing retirement funds such as 401(k)s or IRAs are great options for long-term savings. Millennials have an average credit score of 690. Here\u2019s how they compare to other generations: Millennials\u2019 lived experiences are different from those of the generations before them. Millennials\u2019 money habits, whether saving or spending, are inextricably linked to the world around them. They may have a reputation for being reckless spenders, but in actuality, millennials are actively saving for emergencies and retirement.

            "content": "A top-notch budget can help propel your business success Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. You've just purchased or opened a small business and you know your trade. But when it comes to bookkeeping\u2014and more specifically, budgeting\u2014your skill set is lacking. The good news is that it is possible to come up with a budget (or at least a good estimation of what will be needed in terms of dollars and cents) fairly easily. Estimating and matching expenses to revenue (real or anticipated) is important because it helps small business owners to determine whether they have enough money to fund operations, expand the business, and generate income for themselves. Without a budget or a plan, a business runs the risk of spending more money than it is taking in, or conversely, not spending enough money to grow the business and compete. Every small business owner tends to have a slightly different process, situation, or way of budgeting. However, there are some parameters found in nearly every budget that you can employ. For example, many business owners must make rent or mortgage payments. They also have utility bills, payroll expenses, cost of goods sold (COGS) expenses (raw materials), interest, and tax payments. The point is every business owner should consider these items and any other costs specifically associated with the business when setting up shop or taking over an existing business. With a business that is already up and running, you can make assumptions about future revenue based on recent trends in the business. If the business is a startup, you'll have to make assumptions based on your geographic area, hours of operation, and by researching other local businesses. Small business owners can often get a sense of what to expect by visiting other businesses that are for sale and asking questions about weekly revenue and traffic patterns. After you've researched this information, you should then match the business's revenue with expenses. The goal is to figure out what an average weekly expense for overhead, utilities, labor, raw materials, etc. would look like. Based on this information,\u00a0you may then be able to estimate or forecast whether\u00a0you'll have enough extra money to expand\u00a0the business or to tuck away some money into savings. On the flip side, owners may realize that in order to have three employees instead of two, the business will have to generate more in revenue each week. These six simple tips will help you put together a top-notch small business budget: Not all businesses are alike, but there are similarities. Therefore, do some homework and peruse the internet for information about the industry, speak with local business owners, stop into the local library,\u00a0and check the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website to get an idea of what percentage of the revenue coming in will likely be allocated toward cost groupings. Small businesses can be extremely volatile as they are more susceptible to industry downturns than larger, more diversified competitors.\u00a0So,\u00a0you only need to look for an average here, not specifics. Prior to buying or opening a business, construct a spreadsheet to estimate what total dollar amount and percentage of your revenue will need to be allocated toward raw materials and other costs. It's a good idea to contact any suppliers you'd have to work with before you continue on. Do the same thing for rent, taxes, insurance(s), etc. It's also important you understand the different types of budgets you'll need to set up for your small business and how to implement them. Remember that although you may estimate that the business will generate a certain rate of revenue growth going forward or that certain expenses will be fixed or can be controlled, these are estimates and not set in stone. Because of this, it's wise to factor in some slack and make sure that you have more than enough money socked away (or coming in) before expanding the business or taking on new employees. If times are tight and money must be found somewhere in order to pay a crucial bill, advertise, or otherwise capitalize on an opportunity, consider cost-cutting. Specifically, take a look at items that can be controlled to a large degree. Another tip is to wait to make purchases until the start of a new billing cycle or to take full advantage of payment terms offered by suppliers and any creditors. Some thoughtful maneuvering here could provide the business owner with much-needed breathing and expansion room. While many firms draft a budget yearly, small business owners should do so more often. In fact, many small business owners find themselves planning just a month or two ahead because business can be quite volatile, and unexpected expenses can throw off revenue assumptions. Establishing a budget planning calendar can be an effective tool for business owners to ensure they have enough capital to meet their business needs. Don't be afraid to shop around for new suppliers or to save money on other services being performed for your business. This can and should be done at various stages, including when purchasing or starting up a business, when setting annual or monthly budgets, and during periodic business reviews. Budgeting is an easy, but essential process that business owners use to forecast (and then match) current and future revenue to expenses. The goal is to make sure that enough money is available to keep the business up and running, to grow the business, to compete, and to ensure a solid emergency fund.

            "title": "Chapter 7 vs. Chapter 11: What's the Difference?",
            "content": "One involves liquidating assets, while the other reorganizes them Companies that find themselves in a dire financial situation where bankruptcy is their best\u2014or only\u2014option have two main choices in the U.S.: Chapter 7 bankruptcy or Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Both are also available to individuals. Under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the business closes its doors and its assets are sold off to pay its creditors. In a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the company may continue to operate under court supervision. Chapter 7 bankruptcy is sometimes called liquidation bankruptcy. Businesses going through this type of bankruptcy are past the stage of recovery and must sell off assets to pay their creditors. The process works much the same for individuals. The bankruptcy court will appoint a trustee to ensure that creditors are paid off in the right order, following the rules of \u201cabsolute priority.\u201d Secured debt takes precedence over unsecured debt in bankruptcy, and the holders of secured debts are first in line to be paid off. Loans that are secured by a specific asset, such as a building or a piece of expensive machinery, are examples of secured debt. Whatever assets and cash remain after all the secured creditors have been paid are pooled together and distributed to creditors with unsecured debt. Those would include bondholders and shareholders with preferred stock. To qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the debtor can be a corporation, a small business, or an individual. Individuals are also eligible for another form of bankruptcy, Chapter 13, in which the debtor agrees to repay at least a portion of their debts over a three- to five-year period under court supervision. Chapter 11 bankruptcy is also known as \u201creorganization\u201d or \u201crehabilitation\u201d bankruptcy. It is the most complex form of bankruptcy and generally the most expensive. For that reason, it\u2019s most often used by businesses rather than individuals. The business may be corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, or limited liability companies (LLCs). Unlike Chapter 7, Chapter 11 gives a company an opportunity to reorganize its debt and try to reemerge as a healthy business. A Chapter 11 case starts with the filing of a petition in a bankruptcy court. The petition may be a voluntary one, filed by the debtor, or an involuntary one, filed by creditors who want their money. During Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the business will keep operating while taking initiatives to stabilize its finances, such as cutting expenses, selling off assets, and attempting to renegotiate its debts with creditors\u2014all under the court\u2019s supervision. The Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019, which went into effect on Feb. 19, 2020, added a new subchapter V to Chapter 11 designed to make bankruptcy easier and faster for small businesses, which the U.S. Department of Justice defined as \u201centities with less than about $2.7 million in debts that also meet other criteria.\u201d The act \u201cimposes shorter deadlines for completing the bankruptcy process, allows for greater flexibility in negotiating restructuring plans with creditors, and provides for a private trustee who will work with the small business debtor and its creditors,\u201d the Justice Department says. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020, made temporary changes to bankruptcy laws designed to make the process more available to businesses and individuals economically disadvantaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes ended, for the most part, in March 2021. Like Chapter 7, Chapter 11 requires the appointment of a trustee. However, rather than selling off all assets to pay back creditors, the trustee supervises the assets of the debtor and allows the business to continue. It\u2019s important to note that debt is not absolved in Chapter 11. The restructuring only changes the terms of the debt, and the company must continue to pay it back through future earnings. If a company is successful in Chapter 11, then typically it will be expected to continue operating in an efficient manner with its newly structured debt. If it is not successful, it will file for Chapter 7 and liquidate. Known as \u201cliquidation\u201d bankruptcy Assets are sold off by a trustee to pay debts When all assets are sold, the remaining debt generally is forgiven Used by both businesses and individuals Known as \u201creorganization\u201d bankruptcy Debts are restructured by a trustee, and the business continues Remaining debts must be paid back through future earnings Used primarily by businesses Bankruptcy is generally a last resort for businesses and individuals alike. Chapter 7 will, in effect, put a business out of business, while Chapter 11 may make lenders wary of dealing with the company after it emerges from bankruptcy. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy will remain on an individual\u2019s credit report for 10 years, and a Chapter 13 for seven. Bankruptcy can be unavoidable. A business can go under during a severe recession. An individual can suffer a job loss or crushing medical expenses. Still, many bankruptcies could have been avoided. One key, for both businesses and individuals, is to borrow judiciously. For a business, that could mean not expanding too rapidly. For an individual, it might mean not buying a larger home or a costlier car. Before filing for bankruptcy, a business owner should consult with an outside attorney who specializes in bankruptcy law and discuss the alternatives. Individuals are required by law to take an approved credit counseling course before they file. They may also have other resources available, such as a reputable debt relief company that can help them negotiate with their creditors. Investopedia publishes an annual list of the best debt relief companies. Individuals can file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 without an attorney, according to the website of the U.S. federal courts system. This is called \"filing pro se.\" However, the site strongly recommends seeking the help of a qualified attorney \"because bankruptcy has long-term financial and legal outcomes\" and misunderstandings or mistakes can have serious results. Chapter 11 bankruptcies can be filed by any individual, business, partnership, joint venture, or limited liability company, with no specific debt-level limits and no required income. Both Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 allow for the discharging of debts but have different costs, eligibility, and time to completion, making them two different types of bankruptcies.  Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 are two common options for businesses to declare bankruptcy. Chapter 7 is considered a liquidation bankruptcy: it doesn't require a repayment plan but the business has to sell some assets to pay creditors. Chapter 11 is considered a reorganization bankruptcy that allows businesses to maintain their operations while creating a plan to repay creditors.

            "title": "How Would a Trade War Affect You?",
            "content": "On Friday, July 6th, 2018 at exactly 12:01 am, the U.S. fired the first shots in a war. No missiles were used. Nor were drones or U.S. Marines involved. Instead, these shots were billions of dollars worth of tariffs aimed at the Chinese economy. This was a trade war. One that continues and could become the largest in world history. In this article, we take a look at what trade wars can mean for the disputing countries, businesses, and consumers. The term trade war\u00a0is used to describe an economic conflict where, in response to protectionism, countries impose trade barriers such as tariffs, restrictions, and quotas against each other. Basically, one country imposes targeted tariffs on another\u2019s economy in order to protect its own economy, or to hurt that of its adversary. The former may believe that the trading practices of the latter are unfair. Let's say Country A and Country B both manufacture rubber chickens. County B then starts to subsidize its rubber chicken manufacturing. That means that the government of Country B is paying part of the cost of manufacturing, thus reducing the price for consumers. Now, Country A is upset, because no one is going to\u00a0buy rubber chickens from it if they're cheaper to buy from Country B. So, Country A has two options. It can\u00a0negotiate with Country B or impose tariffs on imported rubber chickens. The tariffs would raise the cost of Country B's rubber chickens, punishing\u00a0Country B. If Country B wants to continue exporting to Country A, it has to pay a higher tax on its exported rubber chickens. Then Country B would most likely hit back with its own tariffs. This tariff back-and-forth is considered a trade war. Countries get into conflicts over trade frequently. To sort them out, they can approach the World Trade Organization (WTO) for arbitration and a decision over which is at fault. They can negotiate a deal directly with each other. However, another option\u2014 that chosen by the Trump administration\u2014is to impose unilateral tariffs on its\u00a0opponent's goods in the hope that they will buckle. The U.S. trade war with Japan in the 1980s was meant to correct the trade imbalance involving electronics. President Reagan imposed 100% tariffs on products made by major Japanese manufacturers to punish Japan for breaching its trade agreement. On Friday, July 6, 2018, the Trump administration imposed sweeping tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods. The tariffs targeted a wide variety of manufactured tech products, from flat-screen televisions, aircraft parts, and medical devices to nuclear reactor parts and self-propelled machinery. While it was believed that most Americans would feel no effects of these tariffs\u2014parents wouldn't be shopping for aircraft parts\u2014 the Chinese economy would certainly suffer. The U.S. tariffs specifically targeted high-tech Chinese goods to hurt the Made in China 2025 initiative which sought to transform China into an advanced manufacturing powerhouse. President Trump pushed further, warning that the U.S. could ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods. In 2021, the U.S. imported $506.4 billion worth of goods from China. In response to these new tariffs, China imposed its own. It targeted American agricultural products like pork\u00a0(which added an estimated $57 billion, directly and indirectly, to the U.S. GDP in 2021),\u00a0soybeans, and sorghum. Caught in the crosshairs were American farmers and big industrial-agriculture operations in the Midwest. These are\u00a0constituencies that largely voted for Donald Trump in 2016. China sought to affect these politically powerful groups of Americans directly and dramatically. As the 2018 midterm elections approached, perhaps they'd pressure President Trump to lower the barriers. As of Sep. 2, 2022, President Biden has maintained the tariffs with China. The Biden administration stated that it will review the tariffs. So, why was China hit with tariffs? The first reason points to growing concerns about Chinese economic espionage. The largest set of tariffs from the Trump administration came out of a federal investigation into Chinese intellectual property misdeeds. The\u00a0Trump administration designed the tariffs to punish China for trading\u00a0access to the Chinese market for foreign tech plans. While those concerns were valid, they existed under President Bush and President Obama. Both presidents refrained from imposing tariffs of the magnitude seen in 2018. The second reason concerned the U.S. trade deficit with China. According to data released by the Commerce Department, the gap between American goods exported to China and Chinese goods imported to the U.S. rose to $355.3 billion in 2021 from $310.8 billion in 2020. The Trump administration had been promising to eliminate the trade gap. It blamed the imbalance on the decline of American manufacturing and a reliance on foreign goods. With these newest tariffs in place, the Trump administration hoped to reverse the growth of our trade deficit and punish China for its trading practices. The effect of tariffs can be felt beyond the borders of the targeted country. It's important to understand that U.S.-China trade does not take place in a vacuum. Trade is part of a\u00a0global economy. Different countries can be involved in the making and selling of goods before they reach their final destinations. When the U.S. put tariffs on China, the world\u2019s largest manufacturing hub, it likely affected other countries, products, and companies that are part of the global supply chain. In our global, interconnected economy, it is nearly impossible to target one country (or one industry) without affecting others, including allies. These tariffs had the potential to hurt American companies and consumers even more than the firms in China targeted by the Trump administration. A\u00a0study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in 2011 showed that for every dollar spent on an item labeled Made in China, 55 cents went to services produced in the United States. This is yet another example of how raising tariffs and starting trade wars in a global economy might come back to hurt U.S. businesses and consumers. American consumers may have felt the consequences of Trump\u2019s trade war with China. When companies have to make up for higher costs due to new tariffs, they shift that burden onto consumers. It takes time for these higher business costs to filter down to stores. It is likely that some prices have gone up and more will do the same. A trade war is an economic battle that countries wage on one another to address protectionist policies seen as barriers to trade. Trade wars involve imposing various economic restrictions, such as tariffs and embargoes. A trade deficit is the imbalance between how much a country takes in for its exports and how much it spends on imports. If imports exceed exports, the country has a trade deficit. If exports exceed imports, the country has a trade surplus. There are various viewpoints regarding the need for tariffs. However, when diplomatic efforts related to trade (and other unfortunate behavior such as theft of business secrets or intellectual property) fail to resolve adversarial positions, tariffs and other punitive actions are sometimes the next step. Trade wars are economic battles between countries that seek redress for wrongful economic actions that pose a threat to a country's economic well-being. Tariffs can be part of those battles. However, in imposing tariffs, governments should bear in mind that more than the target country may suffer. Economies operate on a global scale. Economic policies designed to punish one country can have a trickle-down effect on other nations and their consumers. In fact, the tariffs imposed on China by the U.S. in 2018 are believed to have damaged U.S. businesses and consumers without accomplishing the hoped for goal of reducing the trade deficit.

            "title": "Average Propensity To Consume (APC) Meaning & Example",
            "content": "Average propensity to consume (APC) measures the percentage of income that is spent rather than saved. This may be calculated by a single individual who wants to know where the money is going or by an economist who wants to track the spending and saving habits of an entire nation. In either case, the propensity to consume can be determined by dividing average household consumption, or spending, by average household income, or earnings. From the broader economic view, a high average propensity to consume is generally good for the economy. When the average propensity to consume is high, consumers are saving less and spending more on goods or services. This increased demand drives economic growth, business expansion, and broad employment. Low-income households are often seen as having a higher average propensity to consume than high-income households. Low-income households may be forced to spend their entire income on necessities with minimal disposable income remaining to save. Alternatively, high-income households with higher cash flow after their necessities are met typically have a relatively lower average propensity to consume. Economists often gauge economy forecasts on actions by the middle-income households. The spending and savings patterns of this demographic often indicate a degree of confidence or pessimism about their own personal financial situations and the economy as a whole. When annotated as a decimal, average propensity to consume ranges from zero to one. At zero (or 0%), all income is being saved. At one (or 100%), all income is being consumed. The sum of the average propensity to consume and the average propensity to save is always equivalent to one. A household or a nation must either spend or save all of its income. The inverse of the average propensity to consume is the average propensity to save (APS). That figure is simply total savings divided by income. The result is known as the savings ratio. Notably, the savings ratio is normally based on its percentage of disposable income, or after-tax income. An individual determining personal propensities to consume and save should probably use the disposable income figure as well for a more realistic measure. Assume a nation's economy has a gross domestic product (GDP) equivalent to its disposable income of $500 billion for the previous year. The total savings of the economy was $300 billion, and the rest was spent on goods and services. The nation's APS is calculated to be 0.60, or $300 billion/$500 billion. This indicates the economy allocated 60% of its disposable income to savings. The average propensity to consume is calculated to be 0.40, or (1 - 0.60). Therefore, the nation spent 40% of its GDP on goods and services. APS can include saving for retirement, a home purchase, and other long-term investments. As such, it can be a proxy for national financial health. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the average household in the United States saved 3.4% of their disposable income in June 2024. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is a related concept. It measures the change in the average propensity to consume. Assume that the nation in the previous example increased its GDP to $700 billion and its consumption of goods and services rose to $375 billion. The economy's average propensity to consume increased to 53.57%. The nation's consumption increased from $200 billion to $375 billion. Alternatively, the nation's GDP increased from $500 billion to $700 billion. The nation's marginal propensity to consume is 87.5% ($375 billion - $200 billion) / ($700 billion - $500 billion). The marginal propensity measures the directional trend of how an entity is utilizing its money. In this case, 87.5% of new growth was further consumed. Average propensity to consume is an economic indicator of how much income is spent. A specific entity is selected such as an individual, an income class, or an entire country. Average propensity to save measures how much money is saved compared to spent. Average propensity to consume is used by economists to forecast future economic growth. When average propensity to consume is higher, more people are spending more money. This drives economic growth through product demand and job creation. Average propensity to consume may be reported as a percent (60% of income is consumed) or as a decimal (average consumption is 0.6). Average propensity to consume is also generally most useful when compared against itself over time or across entities. For example, the average propensity to consume for a United States citizen could be tracked over time or compared against Canadian citizens. Average propensity to consume is calculated by dividing an entity's consumption by the entity's total income. It is a ratio between what is spent and what is earned. Average propensity to consume is an economic measurement of how much income a specific entity spends. That entity may be an individual or a country. If an entity has a higher average propensity to consume, it means a higher proportion of their income is used to buy things as opposed to save for the future.

            "content": "Like almost everything else in life, your response to money is dictated by your personality. But have you thought about how your behavior affects your bottom line? Understanding your money personality will help you shape your spending, saving, and investing. Big spenders love nice cars, new gadgets, and brand-name clothing. People with a \"spending\" personality type aren't typically bargain shoppers. This often means a desire to have the latest and greatest\u00a0technology and a beautiful home. When it comes to keeping up with the Joneses, big spenders are the Joneses. They are comfortable spending money, don't fear debt, and often take risks when investing. Savers are the opposite of big spenders. They turn off the lights when leaving the room, close the refrigerator door quickly to keep in the cold, shop only when necessary, and rarely make purchases with credit cards. They generally have no debt and may be viewed as frugal. Savers are conservative and don't take risks with their investments. Shoppers often develop\u00a0great emotional satisfaction from spending money. They\u00a0can't resist spending, even if it's to\u00a0buy items they don't need.\u00a0They may be aware of their urge and concerned about the debt that it creates. They look for bargains and are happy when they find them. Shoppers are varied in terms of investing. Some save regularly through 401(k) plans and may even invest a portion of any sudden windfalls to make a purchase. Debtors aren't trying to make a statement with their expenditures. They commonly don't spend much time thinking about their money or tracking what they spend and where they spend it. Debtors generally spend more than they earn and are deeply in debt. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires that credit bureaus ensure that the information they collect about you is accurate and provide a free copy of your report once every twelve months.  Investors are consciously aware of money. They understand their financial situations and try to put their money to work. Regardless of their financial standing, investors tend to seek a day when passive investments will provide sufficient income to cover their bills. Their actions are driven by careful decision-making, and their investments reflect the need to take a certain amount of risk. Many spenders and savers share parts of all five personality types. After evaluating your habits, here are some tips to help tweak your dominating trait: Spenders can limit spending to only things they will use and save more. This provides spenders the opportunity to think long-term and look for slow and steady gains as opposed to high-risk, quick-win scenarios. Credit scores and credit reports are a concern for this type of spender. Relying on credit or debt can affect long-term goals, such as obtaining a car loan or qualifying for a mortgage. Start by calculating your take-home pay. Know how much money is coming in each week or month. Begin tracking and categorizing your expenses and what is left for saving and investing. While you may not be able to change your money personality, you can acknowledge it and address the financial challenges that it presents. Managing your money involves self-awareness; knowing where you stand will allow you to modify your behavior to achieve financial goals. Federal Trade Commission. \"Free Credit Reports.\""

            "content": "The key to living frugally yet comfortably in retirement\u00a0is knowing the difference between frugal and cheap. Paying less for inferior quality is cheap. Paying less for similar or superior quality is frugal. It's all a matter of being methodical in your search for frugal comfort. Frugal budgeting aims to achieve a cost-effective lifestyle in retirement that doesn't sacrifice comfort. This involves knowing not only where to cut costs but also how to do so. Frugal budgeting is not haphazard. It's thoughtful and documented. This involves creating a repeatable monthly budget that projects out a full year to allow for quarterly, semiannual, and annual expenses like income taxes, real estate taxes, and insurance premiums. A frugal budget considers the proportion of spending for each category as a way to find value and savings as efficiently as possible. The Employee Benefit Research Institute conducted a survey in 2022 and broke down how people aged 62 to 75 spend their money. Housing expenses took up 30% of their budgets followed by food at 25%, transportation at 12%, and medical and health insurance at 8%. The Institute followed up with another survey in 2023 focusing on retirement confidence. This study found that 49% of retired respondents felt that their overall living expenses were higher than they anticipated. Of them, 18% said that these expenses were much higher. The most obvious thing to target first is where and how you'll live: your home. Do you want to downsize from your two-story house to an apartment or condo? Relocate to a warmer climate or a small town? Do you want to try living a nomadic life in an RV or on a sailboat? Or are you like many people who just want to stay put, at least for now? It's important to think about the lifestyle you want in retirement so you can apply frugal strategies to it. Downsizing is part of the equation for many, including those who decide to stay put for now. Smaller homes are less expensive to buy and maintain. Downsizing also provides an opportunity to sell or donate household items that are no longer needed. You may be able to save money by using family and friends and renting a truck instead of hiring a moving company because you'll have fewer belongings than you did before retiring. If you have two cars, sell one. Retirement may also be a good time to buy a newer, more fuel-efficient vehicle. Be sure to look at ways to reduce your auto insurance payments, too. See if you can cut costs there. A smaller Class C might make sense if you're planning to buy a motor home. Class A motor homes are expensive to own and maintain as well as costly to drive. You may not need a vehicle at all if you plan to live on a boat. The best way to be frugal with food is to eat at home. Create a menu, build a shopping list, and stick to it. Impulse buying should only enter the picture when you come across an unexpected bargain. Shop for groceries at supercenters, dollar stores, wholesale clubs, and farmers' markets. Many stores offer discount days with 10% or more taken off your entire bill. Save on tipping when you're dining out by looking for cafeteria-style or fast-casual restaurants with limited or no wait staff. Some of the nicer ones have excellent food offerings, table-side drink refills, and even staff to clear your table after you finish eating. Early bird specials offer additional savings when dining out, especially in resort areas. It only makes sense to stay as healthy as possible. Stay up to date on vaccinations and flu shots. Get and stay fit by walking regularly. Walking is free and it's an excellent way to stay fit. Medicare Advantage (Part C) plans are often less expensive than traditional Medicare. The downside might be a limited range of physician choices. Schedule elective medical procedures after you've met your annual deductible and avoid out-of-network doctors when possible. Take advantage of free preventative services that might be included in your plan, like breast or colon cancer screenings. See your family doctor periodically for a checkup. Eliminate cable TV or at least reduce it down to the most basic package unless it's necessary for reception. Add Netflix or Hulu for movies and other streaming options. Museums, art galleries, and many live performances are free or discounted to retirees. Check for discounts through AARP or AAA if you belong to either of these organizations. Many schools allow retirees to audit college classes for free without credit. Ask about retiree discounts everywhere you shop even if there isn't a sign advertising them. You might be surprised at how many places offer them. It never hurts to ask. And as you have more time than when you were working, use it to your advantage. Go to thrift stores. Attend garage sales, yard sales, and swap meets. Grow your own food or at least some of it. You're entitled to a higher federal standard deduction if you've reached age 65 by the last day of the tax year. You can claim an extra $1,850 on your 2023 tax return in addition to the regular standard deduction for your filing status. This is the return you'll file in 2024. The cost of becoming a member of AARP is negligible, as little as $12 a year for your first year as of 2024. You must agree to an automatic renewal of your membership and the price will increase at that time but the increase is only by $4 to $16 a year. You can get discounts for multi-year memberships. The lowest cost of Part B medical insurance coverage is $174.70 per month in 2024. This is based on your annual income from 2022. Premiums increase for high earners. Single taxpayers can't earn more than $103,000 per year or $206,000 if they're married and filing a joint return to qualify for this premium. Earners of $500,000 or more can pay as much as $594 a month for coverage. Don't get up early. Waiting until daylight saves electricity. Give yourself plenty of time to get where you need to go and save on gasoline. One of the biggest enemies of frugality is rushing. It doesn't just waste energy. It also wastes resources. Don't try to be frugal about everything all at once. Frugality isn't meant to be a punishment. Enjoy your frugal lifestyle and stay comfortable for less.

            "title": "How Does a Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) Affect My Salary?",
            "content": "A salary adjustment is a raise that is added to a person's salary to compensate for an increase in costs rather than to reward good performance. A cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is a common type of salary adjustment, intended to compensate for an increase in inflation. For many employees, salary adjustments are made at the discretion of their employer. These may compensate for inflation or increased costs due to an employee's relocation or reassignment. Workers who belong to a union often have a\u00a0cost-of-living adjustment, sometimes referred to as a\u00a0cost-of-living allowance, built into their\u00a0contracts.\u00a0One example is a COLA adjustment required for U.S. Postal Service workers. Social Security recipients are eligible for an annual cost-of-living adjustment subject to a review of changes in the Consumer Price Index\u00a0for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). A 2.5% increase was approved for 2025. The cost of living\u00a0is the amount of money that is needed for an individual or a family to maintain an adequate standard of living, accounting for all of the necessities like\u00a0housing, food, clothing, utilities, taxes, and healthcare. Inflation (or the far less common deflation) changes the price of these necessities and can jeopardize the person's ability to maintain the same standard of living. The computation involved in cost-of-living\u00a0adjustments varies from employer to employer. Some employers may use the\u00a0prior year's increase in the\u00a0Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measures price inflation with the CPI. This index tracks changes in the prices of a set basket of consumer goods and services. While CPI may be used by employers to calculate COLAs, the BLS website points out that the CPI is not meant to be a cost-of-living index. The Council for Community and Economic Research also provides a reputable\u00a0Cost of Living Index. Employers use COLAs to attract and keep valuable employees. A company that does not offer salary adjustments to offset inflation might find itself at a competitive disadvantage to companies that do offer this type of benefit. Some companies offer another type of cost-of-living adjustment. This is a relocation adjustment offered to make employees willing to accept transfers to more expensive locations. Sometimes an employee may transfer to a new city while maintaining the same job and receive a salary increase to offset the higher cost of living in the new location. If you are considering moving to another city to accept a new job, cost-of-living indexes can be used as an indicator of how suitable a salary offer is relative to your current income and standard of living. Housing, food, and taxes vary widely among states and cities. Cities, regions, and states with a lower cost of living mean your income will go further. Moving to an area with a significantly higher cost of living can force a drastic downsizing in a family's lifestyle. Some employers arrange COLA adjustments on a temporary basis for short-term assignments away from home. This is particularly common in the military services. In these cases, the adjustment or bonus pay may be more accurately described as a\u00a0per diem\u00a0allowance to cover a temporary and specific expense, such as higher rent. The extra payment ceases when the temporary assignment ends, whereas a true COLA is a permanent salary increase. The U.S. inflation rate was 4.1% in 2023 compared to 8% the year before. Over time, inflation in the prices of goods and services seriously erodes investment income and pension benefits for retirees living on a\u00a0fixed income. If\u00a0monthly income remains relatively the same while basic costs\u2014food, shelter, healthcare, taxes\u2014increase, retirees who enjoy comfortable early retirements find themselves pinching pennies. Their income has remained the same but their purchasing power has been reduced. Some forms of retirement fixed income\u00a0increase with the cost of living, due to a built-in COLA. Income derived from COLA-based pensions, COLA-indexed pensions, and government benefits for retirees such as\u00a0Social Security, will retain their purchasing power as inflation increases, as long as their COLA formula is sufficient. The IRS periodically updates the maximum benefit that participants can receive from a pension plan each year. The annual benefit for a defined benefit plan or pension must be less than $275,000 in 2024. That's an increase of $10,000 over the previous year. Also, the annual benefit must be less than 100% of the participant's average compensation for their highest three consecutive calendar years. The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment for 2025 is 2.5%. This increase in Social Security benefits is to account for inflation. The increase for 2024 was 3.2%. All recipients of Social Security benefits receive the COLA increase to account for inflation so that the value of their benefits does not erode. You never get too old to owe Social Security taxes. If you have no other income, you will pay no federal taxes on your Social Security income. If your combined income from all sources exceeds $25,000 (or $32,000 for a couple), a portion of your Social Security income will be taxable. The taxable portion is 50% or 85% of your benefit, depending on your total income. Cost of living is a measurement of the income needed to sustain a certain standard of living. Cost-of-living indexes track these costs over time and are used by many employers to adjust the salaries of their employees so that their real spending power does not decline.

            "content": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University. Consumption smoothing is the practice of optimizing our standard of living by ensuring a proper balance between spending and saving during the different phases of our lives. Those who overspend and put off saving for retirement to enjoy a higher standard of living often have to work longer or reduce their standard of living in retirement. Those who oversave will live a more frugal lifestyle while working to enjoy a better lifestyle while retired. In each case, the overall standard of living is less than optimal. Saving for retirement is a delicate balancing act. By having a better understanding of the saving and spending requirements to smooth out the standard of living, it is possible to achieve a higher overall standard of living, at least in theory. Striking a balance is one of the major challenges of financial planning. Consumption smoothing is also necessary in the short term. Millions of Americans have unsteady streams of income. A freelancer or shift worker might have $3,000 to spend in one month and only $1,000 to spend the next while living expenses such as rent and food remain the same. Consumption smoothing allows them to control their spending so that they can meet their various obligations when income is fluctuating. To achieve consumption smoothing, most people plan and try to stick to a budget so that they can pay their bills when they come due. As an economics concept, consumption smoothing captures the desire of people to have a stable path of consumption. There are several related areas of study to consumption smoothing, such as behavioral economics, psychology, and even anthropology. Humans dislike and go to great lengths to eliminate uncertainty in their day-to-day lives, but it is impossible to do so completely. Consumption smoothing is an attempt by economists to identify how to eliminate the uncertainty by adjusting consumption (spending) patterns. Consumption smoothing has some validity in the short run, but the long-term predictive value is mixed. Because it is hard to anticipate future events, such as a change in income (be it a raise at work or loss of employment), a change in the tax code, or unforeseen tragic events (loss of a loved one), it is even harder to predict future consumption patterns. For instance, since the early 1980s to 2019, according to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Americans have steadily increased healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP while consumption of food-related items has remained flat, relatively, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. Consumption smoothing would seek to describe these changes in spending in economic terms. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. \"Historical.\" Accessed July 6, 2021.

            "title": "Employee Benefits: How to Know What to Choose",
            "content": "What to know about your employer's benefits package If you've started a new job, you may be overwhelmed with the choices in employee benefits, depending on your employer's offerings, from 401(k) plans to life insurance. Most companies require the employee to work for specific periods\u2014called vesting\u2014before they become eligible to receive or restart benefits. Understanding how the most common employee benefits work will help you choose the best options for your situation so you can gain the maximum benefits from your employer. Learn how to choose employee benefits that fit your needs and how to avoid mistakes. Many employers offer their employees a 401(k) plan, which provides a tax-advantaged way to save for retirement. The IRS allows you to contribute up to a set maximum, which changes from year to year. Many experts agree that it is best to contribute as much as you can afford as early as possible, so you can maximize the tax advantages. Typically, you will have to decide how you want your contributions to be invested. Factor in your risk tolerance and investing goals when you choose how to invest through your 401(k). Generally, younger people can handle more risk because they have more time to weather the ups and downs of the market. Keep in mind that you can change your investment choices. You will probably have the choice of investing in money market funds as well as stock and bond mutual funds. Mutual funds are essentially a basket of assets that you can invest in at once. One example of a type of mutual fund you can easily invest in is target-date funds (also known as life-cycle funds). These are mutual funds that adjust risk as you age. If you don't have a life-stage mutual fund choice, remember that a younger person would probably do well to be in a more risky stock-based fund as compared to a money market or bond mutual fund, which would be better for those nearing retirement. Many employers match employee contributions up to a certain amount. Not taking advantage of the full employer match is like leaving \"free money on the table.\" Another benefit employers often offer is health insurance. You may have to choose between a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) and a Preferred Provider Option (PPO)\u00a0for medical insurance. An HMO allows you to go to doctors that are contracted with a specific insurance company. If you have a specific doctor you like to use, verify they will be covered under the particular plan. HMOs can cost less, but you may have to be flexible about which doctor and hospitals you use. A PPO is not as strict as an HMO with your provider options. The doctors still have relationships with the insurance company, but you can see a doctor that may not be on the PPO's list and still receive partially covered services. You may have to accept more out-of-pocket expenses, but you'll face fewer restrictions. You will likely also have to decide on whether to accept a dental plan. In many cases, paying for dental insurance is worthwhile because the amount is minimal and typically provides for at minimum routine cleaning and X-rays. If you have significant dental issues, dental insurance may be more beneficial because it can cover some of the costs of dental work so you won't have to pay for expensive repairs out-of-pocket. When considering a vision plan. Look at what the services it covers and estimate whether you would use them. Vision plans often cover an eye exam and some payment toward glasses. Employer-provided\u00a0life insurance is meant to compensate your survivors for your lost wages and income should you die. If you are single and not supporting anyone else, you may not require life insurance. If you have a family to support, you need to think about how much they would need to survive in the event of your death. Keep in mind that term life insurance provided by your employer will likely terminate when your employment ends. Disability insurance provides a payments for a source of income if you were to become disabled. It could supply the support you and your family when you cannot work. You may be wondering how your company benefits compare to those offered by other companies. Benefits can vary widely from company to company. In addition to retirement plans, health insurance, life and disability insurance. you might also be offered: If you are offered a benefit that you do not understand, you can contact your human resources department or benefits administrator. Many companies allow you to change your choices periodically. Often, your 401(k) contribution amount and investment choices can be changed on a fairly regular basis, but the medical and life insurance choices may be set up so that you can only change them once a year. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) allows you to stay on an employers' group health plans after you leave a job. It is important that you file right away for coverage when your employment ends as there is a time limit. COBRA is a temporary solution that generally only covers you up to 18 months after you leave. Check with your benefits administrator if you want to make changes. Making inappropriate choices can be a costly mistake, especially with your 401(k). Also, revisit your benefit choices on occasion as your life circumstances change. Yes, you can make changes, but certain benefits can only be changed once a year. Make sure to do the research needed before making decisions. Especially when it comes to benefits like life insurance and health insurance. Life insurance can offer you peace of mind that your family will receive financial support in the event of your death. Life insurance from your company will often just cover one year's wages and will typically end when your employment ends. Many companies post information online to provide detailed information about their benefits. You can also contact your human resources department for more information about benefits available to you. Employer benefits can provide a number of advantages in addition to a salary, from tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts to health insurance. Spend some time learning about your choices when it comes to benefits so you can get the most out of them. Remember to reevaluate your benefit choices when your life circumstances change. If you have questions about how to enroll or how your company's benefits work, contact your human resources department or hiring manager.

Diane Costagliola is a researcher, librarian, instructor, and writer who has published articles on personal finance, home buying, and foreclosure. The Post-9/11 GI Bill is a U.S. law that provides education benefits to military veterans who have taken part in active-duty service after Sept. 10, 2001. To be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill, an applicant must have served at least 90 days and still be on active duty or served at least 30 continuous days and been honorably discharged for a disability-related to serving. The bill was passed and signed into law in 2008. The Post-9/11 GI Bill, along with the original GI Bill (1944) and the Montgomery GI Bill (1984), represents a continued effort by the federal government to provide benefits to veterans returning from duty. The original GI Bill was created in response to the failure of the U.S. government to provide benefits to veterans of World War I, which had resulted in protests during the Great Depression. Benefits of the Post-9/11 GI Bill include up to 100% tuition and fee coverage for education, a monthly housing allowance for school, and a one-time relocation allowance for eligible service members. Education includes college degrees, vocational training,\u00a0and apprenticeship programs, among others. If a service member is eligible for other educational benefits offered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs separate from the Post-9/11 GI Bill, they will have to choose between them. You can\u2019t receive other education benefits at the same time, and the decision can\u2019t be changed after a choice is made. Service members may be eligible if they served at least 90 aggregate days on active duty after Sept. 10, 2001, or were honorably discharged from active duty for a service-related disability after serving at least 30 continuous days following Sept. 10, 2001. If military service ended before Jan. 1, 2013, benefits expire 15 years after the last separation date from active service. All benefits must be used by that time, or whatever is left will expire. If service ended on or after Jan. 1, 2013, benefits won\u2019t expire due to the Forever GI Bill \u2014 Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act, which was signed into law in 2017. Children of a member of the armed forces who died in the line of duty on or after Sept. 11, 2001, may be eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits under the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship program. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides funding for training, as well as tuition assistance to veterans. The bill provides up to three years of benefits. An update to the bill, the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010, expanded eligibility to members of the National Guard and Active Guard and Reserve. The Post-9/11 GI Bill has several benefits, including: If you are a qualified service member, you can transfer all 36 months or a portion of your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to a spouse or child. The Department of Defense must approve the transfer. All Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit payments are based on the amount of active-duty service that each veteran has since Sept. 10, 2001.

            "title": "Declare Your Own Financial Independence Day",
            "content": "As the Fourth of July reminds us, independence is worth fighting for. On July 4th\u00a0we celebrate our nation\u2019s declaration of freedom from the control and influence of Great Britain. Financial independence also means freedom. And as with the political independence we celebrate every July 4th; financial independence starts with a declaration.\u00a0Here's how to declare, fight for, and win your own financial Independence Day. A quick definition of financial independence could be having enough wealth to live a life of comfort without the need to work. In truth, financial independence can mean different things to different people. In a 2020 TD Ameritrade survey of young Americans ages 15\u201329, for example, 57% of\u00a0respondents judged\u00a0themselves to be\u00a0financially independent by virtue of\u00a0being able to meet their financial obligations without financial help from parents, grandparents, or others. Between those two benchmarks lie myriad definitions of financial independence. Some people have no desire ever to quit working. They just want enough money to be comfortable and to have the ability to cover an emergency without going into debt. For others, financial independence means freedom from worry when they retire, including the freedom to travel, spend time with family members, relax and enjoy the \u201cfruits of their labor.\u201d Others see it as being able to support themselves and be there for families who need them without worrying about being able to afford to help\u2014or having enough to support the institutions and causes they value. Your definition could incorporate many of these goals. Whatever financial independence means to you, unless you win the lottery or inherit a fortune, it will likely only happen if you are willing to go after it. The Founding Fathers knew that America\u2019s independence would not be achieved without a fight. And they knew the fight would not be successful without a strategic plan.\u00a0So\u00a0it is with financial independence. The plans we're discussing can help you build your way to financial independence. But it's important to recognize that strategy and prudence can only go so far. Family responsibilities, health, personal circumstances, and social privilege\u2014or the lack of it\u2014play a large role in how free an individual is to build wealth and achieve financial independence. This advice is given in that spirit, knowing that the playing field in America has never been completely even. The independence and freedom declared on July Fourth and won in the Revolutionary War is important to celebrate. But Americans must also recognize that it left out the majority of the new nation's inhabitants; our nation is still fighting to feel and be fully equal and free. Just as there is no absolute definition of financial independence, there is also no one strategy that will help you gain financial independence. That said, all strategic plans have some features in common. You will need to set financial objectives, choose the assets\u2014financial and otherwise\u2014you will need to achieve your goals, decide on the investment strategies and other tactics you will employ, and commit to perseverance to keep fighting for your financial independence until (given hard work and some luck) it is in hand. Your financial objectives are unique to you. Think about your long-term goals. Do you want total financial independence\u2014freedom from working for a living, and the ability to do as you please? Or are your objectives more modest? Are you OK with a mostly independent lifestyle with some need to supplement your passive income? Your age and financial situation will influence your choice of objectives.\u00a0If you are in your 20s\u00a0or 30s, you have decades to achieve your goals along with the ability to take more risks. At that age, you may even want to pursue what\u2019s known as the\u00a0FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)\u00a0strategy, which involves an extreme savings and investment strategy designed to allow you to retire far earlier than normal. Or, as the respondents in the TD Ameritrade survey indicated, your goal may be to be able to pay your bills and avoid debt. If you are older,\u00a0say between 50 and 65, you likely already have retirement-savings objectives but even if not, there is still time to plan for financial independence. Depending on your goals and accumulated assets, this may involve a riskier investment strategy to make up for lost time. Or you may need to reset what defines retirement comfort. Whatever your objectives, write them down. Keep them in front of you as constant reminders of where you want to end up\u2014living a life, as you define it, of financial independence. Which tools (weapons) will you need to achieve your objectives? These can include income-producing\u00a0assets\u00a0of many kinds\u2014ranging from a\u00a0high-yield savings account\u00a0or\u00a0CDs\u00a0to a portfolio of\u00a0dividend-paying stocks, bonds (or\u00a0bond funds), and\u00a0real estate. A home is many people's largest asset\u2014and can turn into a source of equity or be used in a reverse mortgage to help fund retirement. And that's not the only way to invest in real estate. Rental properties\u00a0can generate significant amounts of cash flow but can require substantial investment and risk. REITS (real estate investment trusts) are another way to invest. Another wealth-building asset would be to start and run a successful business with the ultimate goal of either not being directly involved in day-to-day management or of selling the business for a substantial profit. Assets also include intangibles, such as knowledge and skill. You were not born knowing about the stock market,\u00a0rental properties, or how to run a small business. You were born with the ability to learn, research, read, and experiment\u00a0with different strategies to see what works. Your successful journey to financial independence depends a lot on your actions. These are the things you need to learn about and do to achieve financial independence as you define it. Start with a budget that takes into account income and other available assets, allows you to pay your living expenses, and if at all possible, lets you save and invest. Think of your budget as a roadmap to financial independence. Pay attention to where the money goes and avoid dead ends. Cut costs where possible, creating more opportunities for saving and investment. Take full advantage of any employer-provided retirement savings plans, if you have access to them, or start building your own through an IRA or Roth IRA. On the other hand, it's important to allow for fun (unless you are following the FIRE strategy above). Just don't go overboard and, above all, do not borrow for recreation. Along the same vein, expect the unexpected by creating an emergency fund to provide liquidity when you need it most for an unexpected (but necessary) expense. Planning for unexpected events that could derail your plans is crucial. It doesn't have to be a pandemic; it could be illness, an unexpected job loss, or an economic crisis like the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009. Finally, develop an investment strategy that takes advantage of the power of compound interest. Compound interest is free money and adds up over time. Learn as much as you can about investing but also take advantage of the knowledge others already have. If investing is a major part of your wealth plan, find and utilize an investment advisor as early in the process as possible. The notion of the need for \"eternal vigilance\" in the pursuit of liberty, often attributed to Thomas Jefferson, could also be applied to financial independence. The road to financial independence requires a lifetime commitment to continuous budgeting and investment. You also need to be watchful about situations that could lead to having money trickle out that could be put to better use. Or that could lead to accumulation of more debt that you can handle. If you feel it coming on, make yourself stop and pay attention, and work to find a solution, whether it's debt counseling, debt consolidation, or even that old standby\u2014putting the credit cards in a drawer and not using them. Keep looking for new opportunities and new ways to make the most of your hard-earned capital. Perseverance also demands that you learn the steps for building a profitable investment portfolio and make sure that you rebalance it regularly to keep it moving toward your financial objectives. Then, adjust as you get closer to retirement. Sometimes success sneaks up on us. If your fight for financial\u00a0independence is intense and persistent, you may end up as the Continental Army did after the British surrender at Yorktown, Oct. 19, 1781. At that point, historians say, the\u00a0Americans had effectively gained their independence. The fight continued, however, for almost two more years until Sept. 3, 1783, when the signing of the Treaty of Paris brought the war to an end. But the fight for freedom didn't end there. The fight continued for enslaved people. It wasn't until June 19, 1865, that Major General\u00a0Gordon Granger\u00a0proclaimed freedom for enslaved people in\u00a0Texas, leading to the commemoration of that date in the Juneteenth holiday celebrated on June 19th every year. What is important today is that you keep up the good fight until you are sure you\u2019ve achieved the objectives you set out to achieve. Just as it did on July 4, 1776, independence begins with a declaration, followed by a plan, including objectives, assets, tactics, and most of all,\u00a0perseverance. A little luck can't hurt, too. And some generosity to your companions on that road. Both people and nations need the company and help of others.

            "title": "Enjoy Life Now and Still Save for Later",
            "content": "Wanting to live well in the moment while saving for an enjoyable retirement can be a financial conundrum. The good news is, it is possible to do both. Balancing these two needs simply means making sure you are keeping your financial house in order while you are enjoying your lifestyle. Individuals can learn to balance these two often-conflicting aims\u2014lifestyle goals and retirement goals\u2014by using the following four-step process: Begin with analyzing the way you live now. One way of doing so is to make a list of questions to ask yourself. This simple test might be called the \"happiness barometer.\" Examples include the following: Then take a look at your finances, and add questions to your list such as: If you answer \"no\" to a number of these questions, then you may need to revise some of your goals, change your lifestyle, or both. These revisions should focus on needs versus wants in your life. If you find a disconnect between your lifestyle goals and your retirement goals, it very likely means you need to either develop new goals or revise your existing ones. Make sure that these goals are realistically based on your financial resources. Again, you will need to distinguish your wants from your needs. To help you keep on track with your lifestyle goals, make a written list of the things you want to do\u2014a list of things that could make your life more pleasurable. This \"pleasure list\" can include, but is not limited to: hobbies you'd like to pursue, places you'd like to go, restaurants you want to try, places where you want to live,\u00a0the kind of car you want to drive, and charities you'd like to support. Review and assess your retirement goals to determine whether you are on track with your projected financial needs and objectives. This includes reviewing your budget and making any necessary revisions. If you have not yet established retirement goals, now is the time to do so. If you need help with this, seek out a qualified financial planner. Once your lifestyle and retirement goals are in place, the next step is to determine whether they can coexist. Incorporate the two sets of goals into your budget and add dollar figures for each lifestyle goal. This is one of the key areas where you will begin to make any necessary adjustments by cutting out non-necessities. Do not jeopardize your retirement goals. Instead, cut back on less-important budget items. For instance, a lifestyle goal may be to play golf one Saturday each month. If your finances fall short of allowing you to enjoy this hobby, don't remove it from your list. Look elsewhere in the budget for a source of funding. For instance, you may find that taking leftovers to work instead of buying your lunch two or three days a week could increase your disposable income. Review each lifestyle goal and determine what it is you need to do in your budget to make this goal achievable. The idea is to make your budget work for you and not vice versa. After you have put your plan into action, check at least once every three months to ensure the plan is on track, and then reassess your goals, objectives, and budget at least once each year to determine whether you need to make any changes. Monitoring and reassessing may need to occur more often if you are falling short of your goals and objectives. Make sure to determine what went well, what didn't, and what you need to change. As you go through this process, you will find that your lifestyle and retirement goals may also change. Be willing to adjust, but be hesitant to abandon important goals. Be persistent in going after what you want. To balance living well now with retiring well, begin with an assessment of your current situation. Then develop a new set of lifestyle goals to achieve what you want. Put a plan in action by determining how you can achieve your goals within your budget, and finally, monitor your plan on an ongoing basis. Over time, if you're sticking to your goals and objectives, you should find that your quality of life\u2014and the comfort factor of knowing you'll have enough to retire\u2014will improve."

            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Investopedia / Ryan Oakley Quality of Life is a highly subjective measure of happiness that is an important component of many financial decisions. Many people think of quality of life as a very subjective assessment. But it is also an essential component of many financial decisions such as the job you take and the place you live. The factors that play a role in measuring a person's quality of life vary according to personal preferences but often include financial security as well as job satisfaction, family life, social connections, health, and safety. Financial decisions often involve a tradeoff in which the present quality of life is decreased to save money or earn more money for the future. Quality of life is strongly associated with financial factors beyond the basic necessities of food and shelter. More money often means access to greater comfort, freedom from many anxieties, and an optimistic outlook for the future. Inevitably, job satisfaction is a key component of quality of life. For many of us, it determines our degree of satisfaction with half of our waking hours. Add in the importance of a paycheck and it affects many other aspects of our lives. If a job provides time to enjoy life but leaves the worker too tired, injured, stressed out, or otherwise unable to enjoy their earnings, it subtracts from quality of life. Today, it is common to weigh both salary and quality of life when considering how good or bad a job is. Quality of life is also an issue when developing a personal savings plan. In this case, the tradeoff involves sacrificing current quality of life to improve future quality of life. This may include postponing luxuries and leisure activities that improve our overall sense of well-being. Quality of life can be measured in many different ways. Numbeo's Quality of Life index focuses on the following eight factors. Purchasing power determines how much goods and services a population can buy with a given unit of currency. Ideally, the more goods and services that can be bought, the better. Safety is measured in a variety of ways, such as crime levels, the ability to walk alone at night, and digital, infrastructure, and personal safety. It can include crime statistics, well-being indicators, safe spaces, and community power. Healthcare evaluates the quality of a nation's healthcare system. It considers factors such as healthcare professionals, equipment, staff, doctors, costs, infrastructure, services, and accessibility. Cost of living evaluates how much it costs to live in a specific place. It assesses the relative prices of consumer goods, such as groceries, housing (rent or mortgage), entertainment, transportation, utilities, and restaurants. This metric seeks to determine the affordability of housing. It evaluates the property prices of an area to the income of the population. If property prices are too high compared to income, it makes housing less affordable, reducing the quality of life. A short commute to work is a good quality of life. It is often possible to save money on housing by living farther away from work but the trade-off is less time to spend with family or hobbies and more time sitting in traffic or waiting for a train. A healthy, short commute to work improves one's quality of life. Pollution indexes evaluate the overall pollution levels in a certain place. Factors taken into consideration include air and water pollution, garbage disposal, cleanliness, noise and light pollution, green spaces, and comfort in relation to pollution. A good climate with moderate temperatures and low humidity is seen as improving the quality of life. An absence of dangerous weather events, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes is also considered in climate metrics when evaluating quality of life. Quality of life depends on the individual, but access to good healthcare, clean and safe housing, healthy food, and a living wage are near-universal factors. These are the top seven countries with the best quality of life as ranked by Numbeo's Quality of Life Index as of mid-2024. Luxembourg is a small country in Western Europe with a population of 671,254. It is an important financial center with a strong banking sector, making it an extremely wealthy nation, with a GDP per capita of $128,259 in 2023; one of the highest in the world. The country ranks highly in purchasing power, ranked no. 1 globally. It had a real GDP of $88.5 billion in 2023 with the services sector making up approximately 87% of GDP. The Netherlands is located in Western Europe and has a population of 17.8 million. It has a varied economy, primarily focused on trade with strong services, logistics, and high tech sectors. The country had a GDP per capita of $62,536 in 2023. The country ranks highly in healthcare, placing it fourth in the healthcare index. It had a real GDP of $1.24 trillion in 2023 with the services sector making up 70% of GDP. Denmark is located in Northern Europe and has a population of 6 million. It is a high-income, EU member that is trade-oriented. The country's economic growth is primarily due to pharmaceuticals, energy, and services, with a large percentage of the population in the public sector. The country has a GDP per capita of $67,967. The country ranks highly in healthcare, cost of living, and purchasing power. The country's real GDP in 2023 was $428.4 billion, with services making up 76% of GDP. Oman is the only non-European country on this list. The country is located in the Middle East with a population of 3.9 million. Its economy is derived from oil, yet it has a relatively small GDP per capita of $23,295. It does have a large welfare system, however. The country ranks highly in purchasing power and safety. Its real GDP in 2023 was $186 billion, with services making up 52% of GDP. Switzerland is located in Central Europe and has a population of 8.9 million. The country's economy is focused on banking and other financial services, making it a high-income nation. Its GDP per capita is $99,994. The country ranks highly in purchasing power. Its real GDP in 2023 was $733.8 billion, with services making up 74% of GDP. Finland is located in Northern Europe and has a population of 5.6 million. The country is a large export-based economy, with large timber, metals, engineering, telecom, and electronics industries. Its GDP per capita is $53,755. The country ranks highly in healthcare, cost of living, and low pollution. Its real GDP in 2023 was $321.1 billion, with services making up 69% of GDP. Iceland is located in Northern Europe and has a small population of 365,036. The country's economy is focused on tourism, fishing, and aluminum. It has a GDP per capita of $78,811. The country ranks highly in cost of living, low traffic commute time, and low pollution. It had a real GDP of $26.2 billion in 2023, with services making up 75% of GDP. If you feel your quality of life is lacking, considering how you define a good quality of life is an excellent first step towards improvement. While everyone's idea of a high-quality life varies, there are some universal markers. These markers may include access to good healthcare, loving relationships, meaningful work or volunteerism, leisure time for hobbies you enjoy, good rest, healthy food, and the ability to perform an enjoyable form of exercise. Studies have found that practicing gratitude and meditation can improve your quality of life. Experts recommend adequate sleep (at least seven hours per night) to improve the quality of life and better control mood and energy levels. Governments can look to data collected from happiness economic studies and indices to find places to improve the population's quality of life. One such index is the Gross National Happiness\u00a0(GNH) index. The latest version of the index, based on a survey of 5,000 Americans, concludes that Delaware residents have the highest life satisfaction, while Oregon residents are in last place. There are many ways that a government can improve the quality of its citizens' lives. Actions include funding good public schools, offering affordable access to healthcare, and supporting family-friendly policies like paid leave to take care of sick family members or newborn or adopted children. These policy movements help families thrive. Many of the governments in countries listed as having a high quality of life provide services and programs to their citizens to help them improve their lives. These include access to living-wage jobs, affordable or free higher education, better gun control laws, and access to high-quality and affordable healthcare. The quality of life in the U.S. is lower than in many developed nations due to declines in personal safety, high healthcare costs, and uneven access to high-quality public education. Some primary indicators of quality of life include sufficient income, job satisfaction, decent housing, access to high-quality education, a reasonable life-work balance, rewarding personal relationships, and access to cultural and leisure activities. Work on improving your work-life balance, relationships, home, and health. Governments can improve the quality of life in their countries by offering affordable and accessible healthcare, investing in education, providing affordable housing, offering family-friendly policies, and putting laws into place for workers to earn living wages. Quality of life can be calculated in many ways. One is from the World Health Organization: \u00a0\"WHO defines Quality of Life as an individual's perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards, and concerns.\" The United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU WIDER) provides four qualities of life: Quality of life is, above all, an individual calculation. Most of us, however, include good health, good friends, loving relationships, and some degree of creature comforts in the factors they assess. It may sound distasteful, but the money we have and the ways we get it have a big role in many of the factors that make up quality of life.

            "content": "Opinion: Why financial literacy needs to start at your kitchen table Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University. Are your kids smart with money? Probably not! Nearly every survey on the subject shows that most adults\u2014let alone kids\u2014can\u2019t answer the most basic questions about credit and debt, or saving and investing. Let\u2019s not even try to discuss amortization and depreciation! Yet, we all know the ruinous impact of financial illiteracy. In Q2 of 2021, the average 401(k) balance is $129,300, according to Fidelity. And, as of 2018, almost 60% of working-age Americans have no retirement savings at all, according to the National Institute on Retirement Savings. That\u2019s not the worst of it. The Federal Reserve says in 2020, 30% of Americans didn't have the cash to pay an unexpected bill of $400, and the 2019 government shutdown revealed that 78% of employees are living paycheck-to-paycheck. There can be no doubt that Americans are unprepared for retirement, and with 10,000 workers reaching age 65 every day, our nation is facing a retirement security crisis of unprecedented magnitude. If you want your kids to avoid this fate, you must make sure they become financially literate. That means, quite simply, that we must teach them about money while they\u2019re young. As obvious as this idea is, few children are getting the education they need. In 2020, only 21 states require high-school students to study financial literacy before they receive a diploma, according to the Council for Economic Education, and most employers provide little to no financial education in the workplace. Next Gen Personal Finance Source: Net Gen Personal Finance Yep, financial education has to start at home\u2014and long before the kids enter high school. You\u2019re already talking to your kids about everything\u2014religion, politics, sex, you name it. Everything, that is, except money. It\u2019s not because you\u2019re afraid of the subject. Rather, you simply don\u2019t know what to say. That\u2019s what was discovered in a survey of parents. Nearly nine in 10 parents of 4- to 8-year-old children (89%) feel it's extremely important that their kids grow up with good financial habits, and nearly as many parents (91%) agree they should be the ones teaching their children these habits. But virtually half of parents (49%) say they don\u2019t know how to discuss money in ways they think their kids would actually understand. As a result, one in four parents never (or almost never) talk to their kids about household finances. So let me help you. Start with The Squirrel Manifesto, the best-selling children\u2019s book that Jean Edelman, my wife, and I wrote in 2018 for 4- to 8-year-olds. It sets the stage for having effective, meaningful conversations with your children, from tots to teens. Your kids learn both by observing your behavior and through their own experiences. From allowances and birthday money to cash, they\u2019ll one day earn babysitting or mowing lawns, set your children on the path to a lifetime of fiscal responsibility through thoughtful, intentional money habits. Here are four principles to begin teaching your children financial literacy: By teaching your kids foundational principles of spending and saving at an early age, you can help them form positive financial habits that will last their entire lives.

            "content": "Mint is gone, but there are other budget apps to consider coldsnowstorm / Getty Images Although Credit Karma offers some of the same features that Mint did, it lacks some important aspects of Mint's functionality. So, you may need a different (or another) budgeting app to manage your finances. For 16 years, Mint was a popular platform for budgeting and setting financial goals. However, it struggled to become profitable, and Intuit, its parent company, decided to end the service. Intuit urged customers to switch to Credit Karma, which it acquired in 2020. Mint was a popular app; at the time its shutdown was announced, it had over 3 million active users. Part of its popularity was its lack of cost: Mint\u2019s budget tracker was free, and it easily synced with your bank accounts to track your spending in real time. However, it wasn\u2019t profitable enough for Intuit, so the company announced its closure in November 2023 and encouraged users to migrate their accounts to Credit Karma, which it also owns. Users had several months after the announcement to migrate all of their account data to Credit Karma. However, as of May 3, 2024, Intuit no longer offers migration, so you'll have to open a new Credit Karma account from scratch. How does Credit Karma measure up to Mint? It shares some of the same features as the now-defunct platform, including: Credit Karma falls short compared to Mint for many users when it comes to budgeting. Credit Karma doesn't have Mint's beloved budgeting features, so you're unable to set monthly or category budgeting limits. Also, Credit Karma pulls data only from synced accounts, and it doesn't include all financial institutions. It doesn't allow you to manually enter your debt, so you may not get a full picture of your finances. Currently, Credit Karma allows you to connect accounts from over 17,000 institutions, but not all financial institutions have partnered with Credit Karma. Our picks for the best budgeting apps are likely to offer the features you need to replace what was lost with Mint. Credit Karma is free, and it provides some useful features, like credit score monitoring. However, its budgeting tools fall short of those once offered by Mint, so you may need another budgeting app to track your spending and set goals. When considering your options for budgeting apps, keep these factors in mind: Credit Karma has been the target of data breaches in the past, and it's currently facing a lawsuit related to a 2024 data breach. Although Mint was popular, it struggled to be profitable. Intuit did not comment directly on the reason, but industry experts pointed out that the company may have decided to close Mint to focus on Credit Karma, which brought in more revenue. Intuit was the parent company of both Mint and Credit Karma. In late 2023, Intuit announced it would be closing Mint in 2024, and it urged users to migrate their details to Credit Karma instead. No, Mint is no longer available, so you cannot go back to Mint after migrating to Credit Karma. Credit Karma offers some of the features that Mint once offered, but you\u2019ll likely have to look to other budgeting apps for other features. If you missed the deadline to migrate your information from Mint to Credit Karma, you can still sign up for Credit Karma. You'll just have to start from scratch to sync your accounts. Using Credit Karma doesn't hurt your credit. Credit Karma shows your credit scores based on your credit reports, but it only performs soft credit checks. Credit Karma does show advertisements for financial products, however. The only way using Credit Karma would affect your score is if you pursued a credit card or loan offer through the platform, as credit inquiries and opening new credit accounts involve hard checks that can impact your score. Is Credit Karma a good replacement for Mint? That depends on what you hope to get out of a personal finance app. Credit Karma has some useful features, such as credit score monitoring, but it doesn't have Mint's robust budgeting functions, so devoted Mint users may find the platform limited. If that's the case for you, another budgeting app that allows you to create subcategories and monthly spending goals may be a better choice. Looking for a low-tech option?

            "title": "What Is the Life-Cycle Hypothesis in Economics?",
            "content": "Adam Hayes, Ph.D., CFA, is a financial writer with 15+ years Wall Street experience as a derivatives trader. Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master's in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology. He is a CFA charterholder as well as holding FINRA Series 7, 55 & 63 licenses. He currently researches and teaches economic sociology and the social studies of finance at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Investopedia / Zoe Hansen The life-cycle hypothesis (LCH) is an economic theory that describes the spending and saving habits of people over the course of a lifetime. The theory states that individuals seek to smooth consumption throughout their lifetime by borrowing when their income is low and saving when their income is high. The concept was developed by economists Franco Modigliani and his student Richard Brumberg in the early 1950s. The LCH assumes that individuals plan their spending over their\u00a0lifetimes, taking into account their future income. Accordingly, they take on debt when they are young, assuming future income will enable them to pay it off. They then save during middle age in order to maintain their level of consumption when they retire. A graph of an individual's spending over time thus shows a hump-shaped pattern in which wealth accumulation is low during youth and old age and high during middle age. The LCH replaced an earlier hypothesis developed by economist John Maynard Keynes in 1937. Keynes believed that savings were just another\u00a0good and that the percentage that individuals allocated to their savings would grow as their incomes rose. This presented a potential problem as it implied that as a nation\u2019s incomes grew, a savings glut would result, and aggregate demand and economic output would stagnate. Another problem with Keynes's theory is that he did not address people's consumption patterns over time. For example, an individual in middle age who is the head of a family will consume more than a retiree. Although subsequent research has generally supported the LCH, it also has its problems. The LCH has largely supplanted Keynesian economic thinking about spending and savings patterns. The LCH makes several assumptions. For example, the theory assumes that people deplete their wealth during old age. Often, however, the wealth is passed on to children, or older people may be unwilling to spend their wealth. The theory also assumes that people plan ahead when it comes to building wealth, but many procrastinate or lack the discipline to save. Another assumption is that people earn the most when they are of working age. However, some people choose to work less when they are relatively young and continue working part-time when they reach retirement age. As a result, one implication is that younger people are more able to take on investment risks than older individuals, which remains a widely accepted tenet of personal finance. Other notable assumptions are that those with high incomes are more able to save and have greater financial savvy than those on low incomes. People with low incomes may have credit card debt and less disposable income. Lastly, safety nets or means-tested benefits for aging adults may discourage people from saving as they anticipate receiving a higher social security payment when they retire. Economists Franco Modigliani and his student Richard Brumberg developed the LCH in the early 1950s. This economic theory says that people try to maintain approximately the same level of consumption throughout their lives. That means, generally speaking, when they are young they may take on debt; when they are in their prime earning years they save more. and and when they are old they live off the wealth they accumulated earlier in life. A good example of the LCH theory in practice is saving for retirement. During your working years you save money for when you are no longer working, knowing that you may not have income when you're older. The life cycle hypothesis, developed in the 1950s, posits that people tend to maintain a consistent spending level over their lifetimes. Over time, there have been criticisms leveled against the LCH. One is people don't always maintain a consistent pattern of consumption. Someone who is middle-aged with a family of four and a mortgage is likely to consume more than at a time of life when they are retired and have no dependents and own their home. However, the LHC is still considered an important part of modern economic theory.

These rate increases caused business and consumer loan rates to increase significantly, making it harder to find affordable financing. For those focused on managing their money in the wake of rising rates, expense tracker apps can help simplify the process of tracking spending and saving for specific goals. The central bank announced its first cut to its rate in September 2024, dropping the range by half a percentage point\u00a0to 4.75% to 5%. Expense tracker apps are tools designed to help you manage your money and track your spending. They allow you to sync bank accounts and credit cards to record your expenses so you can see how much you spend each month and where. After you've inputted all the data, you can review your financial details and decide where to make any changes and adjustments so you can save money. Choosing the right expense tracker app depends entirely on you. But, you should take a look at the features to determine which one makes sense. The following is a list of common features that may be offered by expense tracker apps that may come in handy: While you review some of these features, it's also important to ask yourself the following questions: Many apps use artificial intelligence (AI) to make expense tracking easier. Integrating AI can take the guesswork out of invoice and receipt management by extracting data through automation. It can also be a valuable fraud detection tool, identifying and alerting you to suspicious activity and preventing fraudulent transactions from going through if you sync your account with your app. There are different types of apps on the market that can help you with your finances. These include expense tracker apps and budgeting apps. Though they may sound the same, there is a slight difference between the two. Expense tracker apps tap into how your monthly spending habits. These apps record your monthly expenses, such as your rent, bills, groceries, and nights out among other things. Once everything is added up, you get a clear picture of where your money goes each month. You can use this information to make adjustments to save you money. Budgeting apps, on the other hand, help you actively manage your money, giving you a solid idea of your monthly income and expenses. By budgeting, you set aside a certain amount of money for every expense, including groceries and entertainment, so you stay within your limits. Using a budgeting app means you establish clear spending (and saving) goals. Check out our list of the best budgeting apps. Here are some steps you can follow to create a budget: Can simplify financial management: Easier to manage money, separate finances, and track spending Free options: No added monthly costs Helps your financial situation: Establishes budget and can help improve your credit May help you meet money goals: Can help you save for a down payment or vacation Certain apps cost money: Apps with advanced features may come at a cost Features vary: Not all apps are built the same Not all financial institutions connect: You may have to put in more work if the app you choose doesn't work with your bank Requires some upfront and ongoing work: Time commitment required to make the app work Expense tracking apps and other financial management tools require upfront work and ongoing upkeep. They won\u2019t automatically help you achieve your financial goals; instead, you need to commit to using them over time to meet your money goals and improve your situation. Investopedia is dedicated to providing consumers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of the best expense tracking apps. We looked at 30 of the best expense tracker apps available and narrowed it down to the best options based on several features and considerations. We considered pricing, features, reviews, and accessibility. In each case, we evaluated how robust the features were for day-to-day and power users and whether the app was easy to use. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best expense tracker apps since 2021. You may think tracking your expenses is a cumbersome experience. Or that you have a good handle on your finances. But, an expense tracker can be a very useful tool for anyone\u2014even people who are well aware of where their money goes. Tracking your expenses can help you determine where your money goes and where you can make cuts. It may even help you identify things you didn't even know you're spending your money on, such as forgotten subscriptions that you may not use (like streaming video and monthly deliveries), and areas where you may find excessive spending, such as that daily coffee run. Yes, expense trackers work as long as you put in the work and are honest about your spending. If you're determined to make changes and improve your financial situation, an expense tracker can be a valuable tool. For trackers to work, you have to be honest about your spending. This means logging every dollar you spend (some trackers will do this automatically if you sync up your bank account), whether the money goes through your account or you pay for something in cash. It may seem daunting at first, but it will get easier once you get into a routine. You can track daily personal expenses on your mobile device using an expense tracking app for iPhone or Android, or you could opt for paper tracking while reviewing and reconciling your online credit card or bank statements regularly. Your personal preferences will dictate which option is best for you. Some expense tracker apps are tailored for personal use, while others are designed for small business use. If you need to track business expenses, opt for an app like QuickBooks Accounting or Expensify. An expense tracking app could help simplify the process of tracking your monthly payments. If you\u2019re interested in doing so for your small business, an app like Quickbooks Accounting may be a good choice. Expense tracker apps vary in cost, although many are free. Paid apps are typically less than $10 per month, although if you want business features like invoice creation and management, you\u2019re more likely to pay well above that. Before paying for an expense tracker app, check to see if there\u2019s a free trial. A lot of apps offer 30 days to test drive all of their features. Many expense tracker apps are free or low cost, so explore your options and decide if you need a paid app. These apps can help you gain control of your finances, pay down debt, and grow your net worth. Some even allow you to upload receipts, track mileage, and send invoices, which are all helpful if you run a business. The best app for tracking personal expenses is one that lets you track and categorize your spending while also seeing your overall financial picture. It should be affordable, with the features you need to stay in control of your budget. Tracking your small business expenses can make your life easier, especially when it comes to tax time. It can also help you control your cash flow by identifying where your money goes at the end of the month. Consider the following tips to help you track your small business expenses: Be sure to open a business account so you don't conflate your business and personal expenses. This makes it easier to track and identify which costs are related specifically to your business.

            "title": "Do I Need a Personal Accountant?",
            "content": "Individuals are not required by law to keep financial books and records (businesses are), but not doing this can be a costly mistake from a financial and tax perspective. Your bank account and credit card statements may be wrong and you may not discover this until it\u2019s too late to make corrections. You may forget to pay a bill and hurt your credit score. You may have no clue about allocating income to saving and investing. Or you may overlook expenses that could provide some tax benefits. So keeping track of your personal finances makes sense. Recording your income and expenses isn\u2019t a difficult task (you don\u2019t need an accounting background or to be \u201cgood with numbers\u201d), but it does take time and effort. How you do it depends on your personal preference.\u00a0You can hire an expert to do it all, do it yourself or combine the two, using an expert to help you from time to time. If you don\u2019t have the time or believe that your time is worth more than what you\u2019d pay someone else, you can engage professional help. But who, exactly?\u00a0When people talk about getting a personal accountant, they often use the term loosely to refer to everyone from a bookkeeper to a CPA or tax preparer or even tax\u00a0adviser. Select the professional who meets your needs: This person may provide concierge services for your personal finances, including paying your bills, balancing your checkbook, and looking over your credit card statements. A bookkeeper may or may not have special training. A bookkeeper can obtain certification from the American Institute of Professional Bookkeepers or National Association of Certified Public Bookkeepers.\u00a0The hourly rate for a bookkeeper depends on where you are, what services you seek, and what expertise the person offers, but the fee averages to about $22 per hour. Whether you need an accountant will most likely depend on a few factors, including how complicated your taxes are to file and how many accounts you have to manage. This is a person who has training (and likely a college degree) in accounting and can handle bookkeeping chores. The hourly rate, which again depends on location, job description, and expertise, for a freelance accountant is about $35 per hour on average but can be considerably more, even up to $125 per hour. This is an accountant (with a college degree and perhaps a master\u2019s degree in accounting) who has received certification from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). While a CPA can provide bookkeeping services, this professional may be too expensive for the task. Hourly fees for CPAs can run about $38 per hour to start and increase from there. (Most CPAs don\u2019t handle bookkeeping services personally but use an employee in their firm (e.g., a bookkeeper) for this task.) For the tasks described at the beginning, a personal bookkeeper is what you\u2019ll need. Most people do not use an accountant (only wealthy individuals can justify the cost of these tax pros). Your bookkeeper will schedule regular appointments (e.g., weekly, monthly) to input data and perform the tasks you want to be done. Bookkeeping may be done in person (your home or the bookkeeper\u2019s office) or online. Either way, you\u2019ll need to provide access to your bank accounts and credit card statements, so be sure to check the references carefully of anyone you want to engage. Gone are the days of keeping paper ledgers. Today, user-friendly software and cloud solutions are available for the average consumer, not just professionals. The leading options for personal finances are: This software helps you create a monthly budget and monitor your finances. For an added monthly cost you can use a bill-paying system to automate your payments so you\u2019ll always be on time and pay the right amount. This free cloud-based platform also lets you track your personal finances as well as pay your bills online. It syncs with your bank account to simplify your personal finances. Both Quicken and Mint.com have mobile apps to record information on the fly. You can work with a bookkeeper to help you get started with your personal accounting. Look for someone knowledgeable in the software you plan to use. The bookkeeper can set up accounts (which operate like folders) that you place your information in. By creating accounts that resemble the same categories used for tax purposes, you simplify tax return preparation (whether you do this or you use a paid professional). The bookkeeper can also review your work periodically (e.g., quarterly) to make sure you\u2019re recording your income and expenses properly and reconciling your bank statement correctly. However, you decide to manage your personal accounting, be sure to separate this from accounting for any business you own. Build the cost of this accounting into your household budget.

            "title": "5 Financial Mistakes New Graduates Must Avoid",
            "content": "How college graduates approach financial planning during their first years in the real world following college often establishes the pattern for their financial habits down the road. Here are five common financial and budgetary traps young adults can fall into\u2014and how to avoid them. Recent graduates often encounter sticker shock as they establish their new lives. If they leave the comfort of the parental home, entire paychecks can get spent on regular expenses\u2014rent, utilities, car payments\u2014and on furnishing their new nests. Even if they don't, they often still incur expenses, like transportation costs to work or student loan repayments; they may feel obliged to start contributing to the family household budget, too. Despite all these demands on your newly earned dollars, you should strive to save money, placing extra cash flow in a combination of stock, bond, and money market investments. It's also prudent to plan for contingencies, such as automobile accidents, personal injury, lay-offs, and other unforeseen expenses. Recent graduates naturally equate a steady paycheck with newfound wealth and independence. No longer is money being doled out to them, in the limited shape of an allowance or scholarship or financial aid; it's money they earn\u2014and it's all theirs. The sense of autonomy can lead to unreasonable spending habits: spending money on discretionary items or recreational experiences. Paychecks provide only the illusion of security; it's how you use your paychecks that determines your financial well-being. In the real world, assets either appreciate or depreciate. The purchase of a car is the purchase of a depreciating asset because the car diminishes in value as soon as it leaves the lot. The same is true for furniture, clothing, and expensive TVs. Flying to Cabo San Lucas over spring break is an expense: Cash leaving your wallet, never to return. The same is true of fine dining and weekend barhopping. Several actions can help create real financial security. One, as mentioned above, has to do with investing: putting your money into assets that appreciate over time, such as blue-chip stocks, dividend-yielding stocks or growth stocks, and even residential real estate (i.e., buying a home). While some stocks pay cash dividends as a way to return money to investors, bonds are debt securities or loans issued by a company or government. Unlike stocks, bonds do not provide the investors with ownership of a company. Investors who purchase bonds may, in return, receive periodic interest payments, and at the bond's maturity, the principal\u2014or original amount invested\u2014is returned to the bondholder. There's also investing in yourself to improve your prospects for growth and increased income. By devoting money each month to improve your performance as a professional, you can expect to earn more promotions and higher pay over the long run than your complacent counterparts. These personal investments can take the form of training, online classes, industry certifications, books, and seminars. Depreciating assets and reckless spending often lead to only one thing: debt. If a paycheck only provides the illusion of security, debt should provide real fear of the negative things that can happen, especially if unforeseen contingencies occur (like income being reduced or cut off altogether). Debt devours your cash flow and negates your assets, skewing your personal net worth toward the negative side. Establish timelines for eliminating your various debts, including school, car, credit card, and home loans. Ideally, it's best to pay off the debts with the highest interest rates first. There is such a thing as good debt; you can use other people's money to buy appreciating assets, essentially using other people's money to make money for yourself. That's how the private equity firms do it. But the rule of thumb is to discipline yourself in executing your plan of attack. Kill the debt beast, whatever its form, by a certain deadline. If poor habits and consumption behaviors are not kept in check, debt can be financially disastrous. However, large transactions do exist that necessitate the use of debt. After all, the wheels of the economy would grind to a halt if consumers had to bring in sacks of cash to pay the total value of a car or home upfront. That's where credit comes into play. As a means of establishing a good credit history and acquiring appreciating assets, manageable debt can help recent grads become financially credible to lenders when it is time to take out an auto loan or mortgage. Additionally, extenuating circumstances may require a recent graduate to take out an emergency loan. Manageable debt means that payments and the principal balance are easily affordable and that there is a target timeline for an eventual pay-off. It is not an excuse to throw money at the craps table in Vegas. That's an even nastier rabbit hole. Recent grads rarely think about life insurance. And admittedly, from a financial standpoint, it doesn't make sense unless you already have dependents. But if you do, if there are children or a spouse who depend on your income, there's a significant benefit to taking out a policy when you're young. Life insurance for a 22-year-old is a better proposition than life insurance for a 55-year-old. In terms of premiums, it is always cheaper\u2014sometimes substantially cheaper\u2014for a younger person to buy insurance than an older person. Although term insurance is usually recommended for the young, permanent life insurance\u2014in which a portion of the premium goes towards investments within the policy\u2014has its points. A cash value that builds for decades can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars in future tax-free income. Personal finance is a critical area for your mental and emotional well-being. Once you graduate, managing your money and building a solid personal balance sheet should become one of your dominant priorities."

            "title": "Benefits of Living in NJ While Working in NYC",
            "content": " dszc\u00a0/ Getty Images Many people who work in New York City live across the river in New Jersey. There are reasons for this, including relatively affordable housing, reliable transportation options into Manhattan, and avoidance of an income tax on city residents. Read below to learn more about the reasons why commuters might choose to settle in New Jersey. New York City has some of the highest housing costs in the country. As of May 2024, the average value of a residential home has risen to $1,140,709\u2014a 6.1% decrease from 2023 levels. That's not the price of a house. It's a smallish apartment. In New Jersey, the average cost is less than half that, at $522,643, although prices rose 9.8% over the past year. You can get more house or apartment for a much lower price by heading to New Jersey, according to those figures. It might seem odd to commute to work from another state, but if you live in the northern or north-central portions of New Jersey, work is 30 minutes to an hour away. You can take a ferry across the Hudson River from riverside towns like Hoboken and Weehawken, take a train into midtown's Penn Station, or a bus into the Port Authority Bus Terminal. If you would prefer to drive into the city, you may be looking at commute times of an hour to two hours or more. And that's when things are going smoothly. Granted, you could spend nearly that long on subways and buses getting to work from Queens or Brooklyn. A plan to impose a $15 toll on drivers entering Manhattan was put on hold indefinitely by Governor Kathy Hochul in June 2024. The plan had been aimed at reducing traffic congestion but the governor declared it to be too much of a burden on workers and businesses. Having a car in New York City is expensive. Just parking your car in a municipal garage costs a minimum of $500 per month. In any case, using a car to commute to work is more than daunting, given the heavy traffic and the scarcity of on-street parking. Most of New Jersey is much easier on drivers. You can park your car in your driveway or apartment parking lot for free, head to the grocery store, or take the kids to baseball practice. New York City has its own income tax, on top of the state income tax. The city lowest tax rate is 3.078%, and it goes up to 3.876% if you earn more than $50,000 per year. State taxes are relatively high in both New Jersey and New York. The New York state tax starts at 4% and goes as high as 10.90%, while in New Jersey rates start at 1.4% but go as high as 10.75% if you make more than $1,000,000. Notably, sales tax in New York City is 8.875%, while in New Jersey the statewide retail sales tax is 6.625%. New York City has Central Park, the Bronx Zoo, the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, and plenty of other attractions, but New Jersey has a diverse portfolio of beautiful places as well. Granted, New Jersey has some heavily industrialized areas that aren't so scenic. But with 127 miles of ocean coastline, plenty of scenic driving routes, state parks with hiking trails, and a stunning view of New York City from across the Hudson River, there\u2019s a lot of beauty in New Jersey. Most cost of living points\u2014housing, food, taxes, and most utilities\u2014are cheaper in New Jersey than in New York City. Factor in commuting costs in your decision. Income taxes are higher in New York City than in New Jersey. Even though New York's state income tax rate isn't much higher than New Jersey's (New York state income taxes range from 4% to 10.90%; New Jersey's range from 1.4% to 10.75%), New York City comes out higher, as the city levies a city income tax that ranges between 3.078% and 3.876%. In general, you do not pay double taxes if you work in New York City and live in New Jersey. While you are required to file a non-resident tax return in New York and also a resident tax return in New Jersey, you will receive a New Jersey tax credit for, generally, the same amount you paid in New York taxes. As a New Jersey resident, you are also exempt, in most cases, from paying New York City income tax. Commuting to New Jersey is something to consider if you want to pay less for housing and have more space. The state itself offers a lot of natural beauty as well as smaller and less crowded cities and towns. Like other states, there are downsides to living in New Jersey\u2014the cost of commuting and higher property taxes\u2014but New York's neighboring state has a lot to offer.

            "content": "Investopedia / Madelyn Goodnight An inflexible expense is one that cannot be adjusted or eliminated by a company or individual. It is often the result of a contractual obligation or a long-term obligation that can not be easily adjusted or discontinued. Inflexible expenses are often called fixed expenses. An inflexible expense is a recurring required payment or debt. It likely is a fixed amount whose payment stream is unalterable. For an individual, a typical inflexible expense would be a mortgage, car payments, alimony, or child support, which have fixed repayment schedules by amount and date. For companies, interest, rent, and insurance are inflexible expenses. Salaries are also considered an inflexible expense, though only if the employee is paid independently of hours worked or units produced. It is important to distinguish which expenses are inflexible. For individuals, these types of costs may prevent them from taking out personal loans. For companies, these types of costs increase operational risk. The risk behind inflexible expenses is the entity incurring the cost must pay the expense regarding supporting income. An individual must still pay inflexible expenses such as car payments or mortgages should they lose their job. Households should be mindful of which expenses are inflexible, how the loss of income will impact their ability to cover these costs, and how long emergency savings may last considering inflexible expenses. Alternatively, a company must still pay inflexible costs regardless of business operations. On one hand, companies can use inflexible costs to leverage growth. Agreeing to inflexible contracts allows a company to lock into favorable rates today and remain with those rates as the company grows. However, should company profits falter, the company will be forced to make payments using smaller than expected proceeds. A cost can be inflexible, flexible, or a combination of both. For example, consider the cost a company pays to a salaried salesperson. Their salary may be inflexible and guaranteed, while the commission may scale with sales and be flexible. A flexible expense is easily altered or avoided. Flexible expenses are costs that can be adjusted by the amount or eliminated by the consumer. In personal finance, flexible expenses are costs that are easily changed, reduced, or eliminated. For example, entertainment and clothing are flexible expenses. Even necessary expenses, such as groceries, can be considered flexible because the consumer adjusts the amount spent. A company often makes use of flexible expenses to scale costs based on business needs. Consider a manufacturing company that only buys materials when it needs to produce more goods. Should the company want to manufacture one additional unit, it pays hourly workers the time to make the good and only buys enough materials to make that unit. The company can easily decide to forgo manufacturing that additional unit. Though the company may lose potential revenue, it can elect to avoid the flexible expenses. In general, flexible expenses are safer for both individuals and companies. However, they may be more expensive as the consumer pays a premium for the flexibility. For example, imagine a subscription service. The service is often priced to be more expensive should the client elect to pay month-to-month. If the client agrees to a long-term plan (i.e. an annual contract), the client gets a pricing discount but loses flexibility. The entity has discretion of when these types of expenses are incurred. There is less opportunity to leverage flexible costs and capitalize on scale of economy. There is less risk associated with flexible costs. Flexible costs are harder to budget for. The entity does not have discretion of when these types of expenses are incurred. There is greater opportunity to leverage inflexible costs and capitalize on scale of economy. There is more risk associated with inflexible costs. Inflexible costs are easier to budget for. For companies, the concept of inflexible and flexible costs is a managerial accounting concept. Both types of costs are accounting for similarly for external reporting and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. These two types of costs are most useful for making strategic operational decisions and performing internal financial planning. Inflexible costs often exist within a relevant range. A relevant range is a specific activity level that dictates a specific level of service. Should an individual or company shift to a different relevant range, the inflexible cost will change. For example, imagine a company pays rent on a 10,000-square-foot warehouse. The company pays $1,000 per month. This rent is an inflexible cost, but if the company should need to double the size of its warehouse, the company's square footage relevant range will increase. Therefore, the company's inflexible expense will increase to $1,600 per month, the market rate for 20,000 square feet. The relevant range also increases based on the number of underlying variables. Imagine an individual has a monthly car payment of roughly $300. Should the individual decide to buy a second car, the relevant range has doubled, and the individual now has two car payments of $300. Should the relevant range increase again, the individual now owns three cars and must pay ~$900/month. When displayed on a graph, a relevant range usually looks like a staircase. As long a spender remains on the current step, its inflexible cost will stay the same. If a spender changes the step they are on, their inflexible cost may increase or decrease. Inflexible expenses are one of several criteria considered by lenders in granting personal loans, mortgages or auto loans. Personal loans are not secured by collateral, unlike a mortgage or car loan, so eligibility criteria are stricter. Lenders closely examine current sources of income and monthly expenses. Even if the applicant has strong earnings, lenders measure debt by evaluating the amount on credit cards as well as inflexible expenses. The debt-to-income ratio (DTI) equals total monthly debt payments divided by gross monthly income. A lender analyzes both the back-end ratio to analyze inflexible costs excluding housing costs as well as the front-end ratio to analyze inflexible costs including housing costs. For example, a borrower with $6,000 in monthly income and $2,000 in monthly debt payments has a DTI ratio of 33 percent. Lenders look for a DTI ratio of no more than 43 percent, which is the maximum mortgage lenders allow applicants to have. If an individual has too many inflexible expenses, they will not qualify for a home loan if their income is not high enough. An inflexible cost is an expense that does not change within a relevant range. For an individual, inflexible costs include car payments, mortgages, fixed loan payments, and installment plan payments on credit cards. For a company, inflexible costs include rent, insurance, leases, and salaries. An inflexible cost can not be avoided in the short-term, while a flexible cost is at the discretion of the spender. An individual can choose to not buy new clothes (assuming they are not a necessity), but it can not avoid its monthly obligatory car payment. Inflexible costs are often considered riskier than flexible costs. These obligations are required without consideration of the entity's ability to pay or income stability. For example, an individual owes its monthly car payment regardless of its income doubled last month or if it was laid off. Inflexible costs can be used to leverage growth and lock in low pricing, though it leaves the debtor at-risk should they loose income.

            "content": "xavierarnau / Getty Images Green Monday is one of the retail industry's busiest shopping days. It represents the day many shoppers rush to purchase last-minute holiday gifts and take advantage of deals. Green Monday occurs on the second Monday of every December. The term Green Monday was reportedly created by eBay (EBAY) as a way to represent the rush of last-minute online shoppers in December. The day has its origins with eBay, which claims to have coined the term Green Monday in 2007 after it realized that the second Monday\u00a0in December was one of its most profitable sales days. Green Monday is also known as Cyber Monday in retail circles due to its high volume of online shoppers seeking last-minute holiday deals. The term green in Green Monday can refer to green for dollars or environmentally green for those who consider online shopping a more eco-friendly endeavor than driving to\u00a0brick-and-mortar stores. Green Monday is eclipsed by Black Friday and Cyber Monday in terms of popularity, but this retail event is becoming a marker of holiday sales. Green Monday is promoted by big-box stores and online shopping giants like\u00a0Amazon (AMZN) and Target (TGT). Other retailers may simply offer holiday deals on that day to reach holiday shoppers and reduce merchandise before the end of the year. Green Monday 2024 is Dec. 9. Green Monday occurs in mid-December, just weeks before Christmas. In the United States, the holiday shopping season typically used to begin right after Thanksgiving. Sales were traditionally exclusive to Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, which was when many consumers started their holiday shopping. Now some large retailers offer sales weeks before and for several days after Thanksgiving. Here are the major retail shopping days that occur during the holiday season: Retailers offer discounts online and in-store on Black Friday. Many open their doors during the predawn hours on Black Friday. To keep up with the competition, some retailers keep their operations going on the Thanksgiving holiday, while others begin offering deals earlier in November. Many people are off of work and eager to spend money. Online and traditional retailers capitalize on this busy shopping day by offering special sales. Some analysts and investors look at Black Friday sales numbers as a litmus test of\u00a0the overall health of the entire retail industry. Small Business Saturday is the day after Black Friday. The event was established by American Express in 2010 to help drum up support for small businesses and mom-and-pop shops that suffered during the financial crisis. Cyber Monday is the Monday following Thanksgiving. Now a global phenomenon, Cyber Monday entices consumers to shop online. In recent years, Cyber Monday sales have exceeded Black Friday sales. The National Retail Federation predicts that retail sales in the 2024 winter holiday season will exceed 2023 by 2.5% to 3.5%. Green Monday occurs on the second Monday in December each year. In 2024, Green Monday takes place on Dec. 9. The first Green Monday was in December 2007. eBay maintains it created the name after it figured out that the second Monday in December was one of its biggest sales days of the year. Cyber Monday takes place on the Monday following the Thanksgiving weekend. Online retailers give discounts on this day and traditional retailers offer exclusive, website-only deals. The holiday shopping season gives retailers a big boost. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the days that typically bring in the most sales. There are lesser-known days, as well. Green Monday, for example, takes place each year on the second Monday in December.

            "title": "Showrooming: What it Means, How it Works, Compared to Webrooming",
            "content": "Luis Alvarez / Getty Images The term showrooming refers to the practice of visiting brick-and-mortar retail stores to research merchandise before purchasing it online for a lower price. The practice allows individuals to look, touch, and test products before they spend their money, especially for higher-priced products. Showrooming became more frequent with the rise of smartphones and mobile devices. Online retailers and consumers both benefit from showrooming because of the competitive prices offered for the same products as traditional retailers. Before the digital era, consumers needed to visit traditional retail stores in order to make purchases. Frugal shoppers looking for a deal had to visit more than one store to get the products they wanted at the best price. But the rise of mobile devices and online shopping changed the way consumers shop. Consumers may still need to visit retailers for various reasons before they make purchases. For instance, someone who wants to purchase clothing may need to try on a pair of jeans to ensure they buy the right size. Or they may want to test out a sofa at a furniture or department store before committing to such a large purchase. Going into a store allows customers to test out products like these before making the decision to buy them. It also permits them to comparison shop\u2014even while they're in the store. By going online, shoppers can check out which retailer has the best price. This is referred to as showrooming. Showrooming allows an individual to make purchases at the best price at that exact moment. Online retailers benefit the most from showrooming because they can offer free shipping over a certain purchase price or to valued consumers. For instance, Amazon (AMZN) offers free shipping to Prime customers. Specialty retailers like electronics stores, tend to be the most vulnerable. Consumers still want to test out this kind of merchandise before they buy. Bookstores also suffer\u2014particularly independent stores whose prices may be higher than online retailers. Online retailers can offer better prices for the same products because of lower overheads and, in most cases, may not charge consumers sales taxes. To combat the growing clout of online retailers, brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT), are using a number of different marketing tactics, including in-store pickup for online purchases. This helps them avoid shipping charges while they offer select products exclusively in physical stores. Other tactics include: Smaller stores and boutiques must combat showrooming in more creative ways. Examples of this may include\u00a0holding special sales, selling in-store merchandise via their website, creating membership clubs, and promoting a shop local culture. Some consumers may like to research their purchases online but still purchase them in-store. This is called webrooming. It is the exact opposite of showrooming and is also referred to as reverse showrooming. With webrooming, a consumer goes online to research products and other merchandise. But rather than buying through an e-retailer, they end up going to a brick-and-mortar store to review and make their final purchase.

            "title": "7 Simple Steps to $1 Million",
            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Your goal is to make $1 million\u2014or more. While it can seem daunting, hitting the million mark may be more within your reach than you think. Most millionaires in the U.S. are self-made. According to a Ramsay Solutions study of 10,000 millionaires, 79% didn't receive an inheritance and one-third never earned a six-figure salary in any one year of their career. But they did have discipline over their spending, a savings mindset, and a willingness to sacrifice, which can be a winning combination when it comes to accumulating wealth. And if you start young, time can be an ally. Many people spend their earnings on goods and services that they don't need. And even relatively small expenses, such as indulging in a gourmet coffee from a premium coffee shop every morning, can add up and decrease the amount of money you can save. Larger expenses on luxury items also prevent many people from putting money into savings each month. It's usually not just one item or one habit that must be cut out if you want to accumulate sizable wealth. It's important to adopt a disciplined lifestyle and budget to become wealthy. People who are looking to build their nest eggs must usually make sacrifices. This may mean eating out less frequently, using public transportation to get to work, and/or cutting back on extra, unnecessary expenses. This doesn't mean that you should avoid going out and having fun, but you should try to do things in moderation and set a budget if you hope to save money. Saving a sizable nest egg only requires a few minor and relatively painless adjustments to your spending habits, particularly if you start young. Your first responsibility is to pay current expenses such as rent or mortgage, food, and other necessities when you start earning money. The next step after these expenses have been covered should be to fund a retirement plan or some other tax-advantaged savings vehicle. Retirement planning is unfortunately an afterthought for many young people, and it shouldn't be. Funding a 401(k), an IRA, or both early in life means you can contribute less money overall and end up with significantly more in the end than someone who put in much more money but started late. Here's an example that spells out the difference. If you're 23 years old and deposit $3,000 per year (that's only $250 each month) into a Roth IRA earning an 8% average annual return, you'll have saved $985,749 by the time you're 65 thanks to the power of compounding. A $1 million goal is well within reach if you make a few extra contributions. Keep in mind that most of your earnings on this type of account are interest. Your $3,000 in contributions alone only add up to $126,000. But let's say you wait until you're 33\u2014an additional 10 years\u2014to start contributing. You have a better job than when you were younger and you earn more, but you know you've lost some time. You decide to contribute $5,000 per year. You get the same 8% return and have the same goal to retire at 65, but your compounded earnings won't have as much time to grow because you started to save later. When you reach age 65, you'll have saved $724,753 in this scenario. That's still a sizable fund, but you had to contribute $160,000 just to get there and it's over $260,000 less than the $985,749 you could've had for paying much less if you started at age 23. In the Ramsay Solutions study of millionaires, 80% of those surveyed invested in their company's 401(k) plan and said that one move was the key to their success. In addition, 75% also invested outside of their company plan and reported that regular investing over the long haul also contributed to their wealth. It's easy to think that preparing your own tax returns will save you money, and you might be right in some cases. But it may end up costing you money if you fail to take advantage of deductions and credits that are available to you. Try to become more educated as far as what types of items are deductible. You should also understand when it makes sense to move away from the standard deduction and start itemizing your deductions on your tax return instead. Knowing which tax credits are available to you can also help you save money on your return. It may pay to hire some help if you're not willing or able to become educated about\u00a0filing your income taxes, particularly if you are self-employed, own a business, or have other circumstances that can complicate your tax return. Many of us rent a home or an apartment because we can't afford to purchase a home or because we aren't sure where we want to live for the long term. That's fine, but renting doesn't offer the long-term investment that buying a home does since homeownership is a good way to build equity. It generally makes sense to consider putting a down payment on a home rather than renting because you\u00a0can build up equity and the foundation for a nest egg over time. There's nothing wrong with purchasing a luxury vehicle, but individuals who spend an inordinate amount of their incomes on cars are doing themselves a disservice because this asset depreciates in value so rapidly. How rapidly a car depreciates depends on the make, model, year, and demand for the vehicle, but the general rule is that a new car loses 20% of its value in the first year, then another 15% per year over the next four years. Consider buying something practical and dependable that has low monthly payments or that you can pay for in cash. You'll have more money to put toward your savings in the long run. And your savings are an asset that will appreciate rather than depreciate over time. Some individuals are extremely loyal to their employers and they'll stay with them for years without seeing their incomes take a jump. This can be a mistake because increasing your income is an excellent way to boost your rate of saving. Always keep your eye out for new opportunities and try not to sell yourself short. Work hard and find an employer who will compensate you for your work ethic, skills, and experience. Becoming a millionaire won't happen by winning the lottery or because of some other unforeseen circumstance. The only way to amass $1 million or more is by diligently working to do so. Expecting luck to bring you a financial windfall will only delay the time you have to build your wealth. The money you spend on lotteries and other get-rich-quick schemes will be better utilized as savings and investments. You can claim a tax deduction for money you contribute to a traditional IRA in the year you make contributions, saving you tax dollars. But you'll have to pay taxes on that money when you make withdrawals in retirement as well as taxes on the money's growth. You're taxed on contributions to a Roth IRA at the time you make them but then withdrawals and growth on that money are often tax-free, subject to some rules that aren't particularly hard to meet. You'll probably want to claim the standard deduction if the total of all your eligible itemized deductions is less than the amount of the standard deduction for your filing status. You'll otherwise pay tax on more income than you have to. Common itemized deductions include state and local taxes, property taxes you paid during the year, home mortgage interest, and gifts made to qualified charities. The total of your itemized deductions should be more than the $14,600 standard deduction for the 2024 tax year if you're an unmarried taxpayer. The deduction increases annually to keep pace with inflation and it changes with marital status and other factors. Equity is the difference between the current value of your home and the encumbrances against it, such as a first and second mortgage or other liens. You can build equity in your property by paying down these encumbrances, such as by making extra mortgage payments over the years. You might also take steps to increase the value of your home\u2014say, by remodeling\u2014but this will cost you money out of pocket unless you're a very capable do-it-yourselfer. You might also simply let market values increase over time. You don't have to win the lottery to see seven figures in your bank account. The only way for most people to retire with a million dollars is to save it up over time. You don't have to live like a pauper to build an adequate nest egg and retire comfortably. Your million-dollar dreams are well within reach if you start early, spend wisely, and save diligently.

She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate.  If you're traveling to the U.S. and plan on arriving in Los Angeles (LA) at LAX airport, you'll likely need U.S. currency for cash purchases, such as a coffee or bottle of water. If you're traveling abroad from the U.S., you may want to have foreign currency on hand to pay for taxis and small purchases. Which are your best options? Whether you plan on exchanging currency at the airport, an ATM, or a local foreign currency provider, We've outlined the ones in Los Angeles. Los Angeles hosted 46.4 million visitors in 2022 (the latest figures available), representing a 91% recovery compared to pre-pandemic levels from 2019. The highest number of international visitors to L.A. came from Mexico, with 1.6 million tourists, followed by Canada, with 600,000. Whether you're traveling for business or pleasure, a credit card is usually the best option for many purchases\u2014especially larger ones, such as your hotel. More and more\u00a0banks are offering credit cards with no foreign transaction fees, so if you travel frequently, it\u2019s a good idea to get one. However, some cards impose a 2% to 3% fee on international transactions, which can add to the overall cost of your trip. Be sure to check the fee listings with your financial services provider or your credit card company. Using an ATM is one of the easiest and cheapest methods to get cash while traveling abroad. All international withdrawals via an ATM typically provide a better exchange rate than you would get at a currency exchange store or airport kiosk. If your home bank has an agreement with a U.S. bank, you can avoid paying any extra fees (ask your bank for policy details). If you will be charged a per-transaction fee, it\u2019s better to take one or two larger withdrawals, instead of several smaller ones. As in any large city, you can find a wide variety of ATMs throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area at banks, shopping centers, and nearby tourist attractions. If you need help finding an ATM, check with your bank to see if it offers an ATM locator app, or search your smartphone\u2019s app store. You can also check your bank's website on your smartphone. If you are arriving at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Bank of America operates ATMs in Terminal 5.\u00a0Other ATMs that are close to the airport include: Many currency exchange stores throughout Los Angeles offer a range of services aimed at travelers entering the country and U.S. travelers headed overseas. While the exchange rate you\u2019ll get at a bank is generally fixed, meaning it doesn\u2019t fluctuate throughout the day, other currency exchange stores may change rates with the market. Call ahead to find out rates, but keep in mind the rate you are told over the phone and the rate you might receive could be different since rates are periodically updated. Some of the currency exchange stores in Los Angeles include: You won\u2019t get the best exchange rates\u00a0at LAX\u2014or any other airport, for that matter. However, if you only need a small amount of cash in your pocket to get your trip started, the convenience may be worth it. If you want a larger amount, an ATM or one of the currency exchange stores mentioned above will likely give you a better deal. To find out the current exchange rate for your currency, use an online currency converter. International Currency Exchange (ICE) operates eight locations within the LAX airport: Located post-security, next to gate 21 (Delta, Aeromexico, Westjet) Located post-security, next to gate 41 (American) Located post-security, near gate 65C (Alaska, Air Canada) Located post-security, near gate 73 (United) For more information, call 310-646-7934. A currency conversion fee is a charge that a financial institution or a network may impose when you convert one currency, such as U.S. dollars, into another. They are one of several fees that travelers to foreign countries may have to pay when they use their debit or credit cards for ATM withdrawals or purchases. If you're traveling abroad, you can usually get the best rates if you plan ahead. Look to online currency brokers such as Travelex, Eurochange, the Currency Online Group, or TravelFX, which provide home delivery. They are likely to have better rates than your home bank. Or use a credit card that has no or low foreign transaction fees to make cash withdrawals while you are abroad. It can be helpful to have at least some foreign currency with you when you arrive in another country, even if it's just for small purchases like a bottle of water or a snack. And you can often get better exchange rates before you travel. Once you arrive at your destination, try to avoid airport kiosks. A better bet is to use your bank's ATM network, if it has one. Any time you travel overseas\u2013for business or pleasure\u2013you\u2019ll need a way to pay for goods and services in the local currency. When you do need to exchange money, be sure to ask how much money you\u2019ll get in exchange for the amount you\u2019re handing over. Just because a place advertises no commissions or no fees, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get a good rate\u2014and it doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be \u201chidden\u201d charges, either. Find out what you\u2019re getting before you give the store your money. A currency-converting app can help you figure out how much you should be getting. Enter the type and amount of currency you want to exchange, and the app calculates how much of the \u201cnew\u201d currency you can buy at today\u2019s rates.

Here we discuss five broad personal finance rules that can help get you on track to achieving whatever your financial goals may be. Rather than ignoring your finances and leaving them to chance, a bit of number crunching can help you evaluate your current financial health and determine how to reach your short- and long-term financial goals. As a starting point, it is important to calculate your net worth: the difference between what you own and what you owe. To calculate your net worth, start by making a list of your assets (what you own) and your liabilities (what you owe). Then, subtract the liabilities from the assets to arrive at your net-worth figure. Your net worth represents where you are financially. It's normal for the figure to fluctuate over time. Calculating your net worth one time can be helpful, but the real value comes from making this calculation on a regular basis (at least yearly). Tracking your net worth over time allows you to evaluate your progress, highlight your successes, and identify areas requiring improvement. Net worth is highly dependent on age. It's common for a younger investor to have a low or negative net worth when they start their career, while an older individual might have a higher net worth further in their career. Equally important is developing a personal budget or spending plan. Created on a monthly basis, a personal budget is an important financial tool because it can help you plan for future costs, reduce unnecessary spending, save for future goals, and prioritize where you put your money. There are numerous approaches to creating a personal budget, but all involve making projections for income and expenses. The income and expense categories you include in your budget will depend on your situation and can change over time. Common income categories include: General expense categories include: A budget is only useful if it is followed. After you prepare a personal budget, track your income and spending across categories. Then, refine your budget based on what actually happened. Once you\u2019ve made the appropriate projections, subtract your expenses from your income. If you have money left over, you have a surplus, and you can decide how to spend, save, or invest the money. If your expenses exceed your income, however, you will have to adjust your budget by increasing your income (adding more hours at work, getting a raise, or picking up a second job) or by reducing your expenses. Most individuals will spend more money if they have more money to spend. As people advance in their careers and earn higher salaries, there tends to be a corresponding increase in spending, a phenomenon known as \u201clifestyle inflation.\u201d Even though you might be able to pay your bills, lifestyle inflation can be damaging in the long run because it limits your ability to build wealth. Every extra dollar you spend now means less money later and during retirement, and higher disposable income today doesn't guarantee higher income in the future. As your professional and personal situation evolves over time, some increases in spending are natural. You might need to upgrade your wardrobe to dress appropriately for a new position, or, as your family grows, you might need a house with more bedrooms. With more responsibilities at work, you might find that it makes sense to hire someone to mow the lawn or clean the house, freeing up time to spend with family and friends and improving your quality of life. As you enter into different phases of life, re-evaluate your personal budget to have it reflect the right conditions in your life. When preparing a list of your expenses, evaluate which costs are truly needed and which you can go without. A helpful scenario is to consider what changes you would make if you were to receive a pay cut at work. If your income were to be cut by 20%, how would that impact your spending or saving? It\u2019s in your best interest to be mindful of the difference between \u201cneeds\u201d and \u201cwants.\u201d Needs are things you have to have in order to survive: food, shelter, healthcare, transportation,\u00a0and a reasonable amount of clothing. It's also important to set aside money each month for savings, although that is much more contingent on your other needs being met first. Conversely, wants are things you would like to have but don\u2019t require for survival. These costs may be engrained in our daily lives, so they may feel like needs. Whether it's a streaming subscription that you use several times per week or a morning treat that is now part of your daily routine, wants are items that are non-essential. This line between \"wants\" and \"needs\" is blurred for essentials when there is no defined level of either. A car is a good example. Depending on your city's public transportation, you might be able to make the case that a car is a \"want.\" However, for the many of us who consider it a \"need,\" what type of car is appropriate? What is an appropriate balance between a higher car payment and a nicer vehicle? Your needs should get top priority in your personal budget. Only after your needs have been met should you allocate any discretionary income toward wants. Again, if you do have money left over each week or each month after paying for the things you really need, you don\u2019t have to spend it all. Saving money for the future is a need as long as your current physical needs (food, shelter, transportation) are met. In addition, some argue that obtaining a 401(k) match by your employer is a high priority. It\u2019s often said that it\u2019s never too late to start saving for retirement. That may be true (technically), but the sooner you start, the better off you\u2019ll likely be during your retirement years. This is because of the power of compounding. Compounding involves the reinvestment of earnings, and it is most successful over time. The longer earnings are reinvested, the greater the value of the investment, and the larger the earnings will be. To illustrate the importance of starting early, assume you want to save $1,000,000 by the time you turn 60, and you expect to earn 5% interest each year. The sooner you start, the easier it is to reach your long-term financial goals. You will need to save less each month and contribute less overall to reach the same goal in the future. An emergency fund is just what the name implies: money that has been set aside for emergency purposes. The fund is intended to help you pay for things that wouldn\u2019t normally be included in your personal budget. This includes unexpected expenses such as car repairs or an emergency trip to the dentist. It can also help you pay your regular expenses if your income is interrupted. Although the traditional guideline is to save three to six months\u2019 worth of living expenses in an emergency fund, the unfortunate reality is that this amount would often fall short of what many people would need to cover a big expense or weather a loss in income. In today\u2019s uncertain economic environment, you might want to aim for saving at least six months\u2019 worth of living expenses\u2014more if possible. Keep in mind that establishing an emergency backup is an ongoing mission. Odds are that as soon as it is funded, you will need it for something. Instead of being dejected about this, be glad that you were financially prepared and start the process of building the fund again. To calculate your net worth, make a list of everything you own and the value of each item. Then, make a list of all of your debts (like credit card debt, car loans, student loans, etc.). The difference between these two lists is your net worth. It represents the amount of money you could have if you sold everything you own and paid off your obligations. Compounding occurs when you grow money on top of the money you've already grown in the past. By saving money at an earlier age, your money is more likely to grow faster due to compounding. Your top priority each month is to pay for your essentials. Focus on costs like shelter, food, and transportation first. After your needs have been met, it's often advised to try and save at least 10% of your take-home income. Remember, just because you have the money doesn't mean you should spend it. If you're able to save more now, you'll have greater earning potential in the future. Everyone's emergency fund will be different. It's often advised to have three- to six months of expenses saved in case of an emergency. This amount might be adjusted depending on your job security and your responsibilities\u2014for example, if you have children. Personal finance principles can be excellent tools for achieving financial success. It\u2019s important to consider the big picture and build habits that help you make better financial choices, leading to better financial health."

            "content": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University. The Philippines, an archipelago of 7,000+ islands in the western Pacific Ocean, is home to a substantial community of expats who enjoy the country\u2019s natural beauty, laid-back lifestyle and lower cost of living. Expats, whether planning to live in the Philippines for the long-term during retirement, or just in the country for an extended visit, might be interested in opening a bank account there to make it easier to access funds. Here, we take a quick look at what it takes to open a bank account in the Philippines. Similar to the U.S., the banking system in the Philippines supports large international banks, national banking institutions and small, rural banks. Expats typically choose either national banks such as Philippine National Bank, Metrobank and Bank of the Philippine Islands or international institutions such as Citibank, Bank of America and HBSC. In general, expats should avoid small, rural banks as they tend to offer limited services and may be subject to closure with little or no notice. Internet banking is available through most major national and international banks, and physical banks are usually open between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. on business days and closed on weekends and holidays. The official currency of the Philippines is the Philippine Peso (PHP). Notes come in denominations of 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 PHP. One peso is equal to 100 centavos, and coins are issued in 10, 5 and 1 PHP, and 50, 25, 10 and 5 centavos. To open a bank account in the Philippines, you must visit the bank in person with several identification documents in hand. While you will always be required to show documentation at any bank, the particular documents that are required may depend on the bank. Many banks require you to have an Alien Certificate of Registration Identity Card (ACR I-Card), a microchip-based, credit card sized identification card. All foreign nationals holding immigrant and non-immigrant visas (including holders of a Temporary Visitor\u2019s Visa) \u2013 who have been in the country for more than 59 days \u2013 are required to apply for an ACR I-Card. You can apply for the card at the main office of the Bureau of Immigration or at one of its field offices throughout the country. The card costs $50, plus P500 (about $60 total). In some cases, you may be able to open an account without an ACR I-Card; however, you may be required to meet directly with the bank manager before an account can be approved. You will also need a passport or some other form of photo identification, a passport-sized photo of yourself and proof of your address, such as a current utility bill or rental contract. The bank will also require a  minimum deposit for the account to be opened. The Philippine National Bank, for example, has a minimum deposit of P3,000, or about $60, for a debit savings account. The bank may also require a bank reference from your country of permanent residence or country of citizenship. The Philippine bank may contact your bank of reference directly, or ask you to submit written certification from the bank. If you were not introduced to the bank by an existing bank client or employee (which is often the case), your account might be put on hold until the reference process is complete. In the United States, any money you deposit at an FDIC-insured bank is automatically protected by the FDIC (the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), created in 1933 in response to the many bank failures of the 1920s and early 1930s. This includes deposits made to a checking account, negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) account, savings account, money market deposit account (MMDA) or time deposit, such as a certificate of deposit (CD) \u2013 with a coverage limit of $250,000 per depositor, per account. If a bank fails, the FDIC ensures you get quick access to your insured deposits. The Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation offers a similar program, but with a much lower level of protection than FDIC provides to U.S. depositors. In the Philippines, your deposits are insured up to P500,000 (about $10,000), which applies to the total amount of money you have on deposit in a bank, not to each individual account. So even if you have several different accounts, you are insured up to only a maximum of P500,000. Expats and visitors have a number of options for banking in the Philippines. Large, national banks and international banks \u2013 including CitiBank and HBSC \u2013 are popular choices for expats. Citibank, for example, offers free withdrawals from any ATM in the Philippines (and 13,000+ Citibank ATMs worldwide) and online banking, so it\u2019s easy to keep track of your finances. With any account, be sure to read the fine print so you know what fees to expect.
