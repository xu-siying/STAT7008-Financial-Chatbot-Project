            "content": "Mira Norian / Investopedia A long-term investment strategy entails holding investments for more than 12 months. This strategy includes holding assets like bonds, stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, and more. It requires discipline and patience to take a long-term approach. That's because investors must be able to take on a certain amount of risk while they wait for higher rewards down the road. Investing in stocks and holding them is one of the best ways to grow wealth over the long term. For example, the\u00a0S&P 500\u00a0experienced annual losses in only 13 years between 1974 and 2023, demonstrating that the\u00a0stock market\u00a0generates returns much more often than it doesn't. The term asset class refers to a specific category of investments. They share the same characteristics and qualities, such as fixed-income assets (bonds) or equities, which are commonly called stocks. The asset class that's best for you depends on several factors, including your age, risk profile and tolerance, investment goals, and the amount of capital you have. But which asset classes are best for long-term investors? If we look at several decades of asset class returns, we find that stocks have generally outperformed almost all other asset classes. The S&P 500 returned a geometric average of 9.80% per year between 1928 and 2023. This compares favorably to the 3.30% return for three-month Treasury bills (T-bills), the 4.86% return of 10-year Treasury notes, and the 6.55% return for gold, to name a few. Emerging markets have some of the highest return potentials in the equity markets, but also carry the highest degree of risk. This class historically earned high average annual returns but short-term fluctuations have impacted their performance. For instance, the 10-year annualized return of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index was 4.02% as of Sept. 30, 2024. Small and large caps have also delivered above-average returns. For instance, the 10-year return for the Russell 2000 index, which measures the performance of 2,000 small companies, was 8.39% as of Oct. 28, 2024. The large-cap Russell 1000 index had an average return of 13.15% for the last 10 years as of the same date. Riskier equity classes have historically delivered higher returns than their more conservative counterparts. Stocks are considered long-term investments. This is, in part, because it's not unusual for stocks to drop 10% to 20% or more in value over a shorter period of time. Investors have the opportunity to ride out some of these highs and lows over a period of many years or even decades to generate a better long-term return. Looking back at stock market returns since the 1920s, individuals have rarely lost money investing in the S&P 500 for a 20-year time period. Even considering setbacks, such as the Great Depression, Black Monday, the tech bubble, and the financial crisis, investors would have experienced gains had they made an investment in the S&P 500 and held it uninterrupted for 20 years. While past results are no guarantee of future returns, it does suggest that long-term investing in stocks generally yields positive results if given enough time. S&P Dow Jones Indices / Investopedia Let's face it, we're not as calm and rational as we claim to be. In fact, one of the inherent flaws in investor behavior is the tendency to be emotional. Many individuals claim to be long-term investors until the stock market begins falling, which is when they tend to withdraw their money to avoid additional losses. Many investors fail to remain invested in stocks when a rebound occurs. In fact, they tend to jump back in only when most of the gains have already been achieved. This type of buy high, sell low behavior tends to cripple investor returns. According to Dalbar's Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior study, the S&P 500 had an average annualized return of 9.65% during the 30-year period ending Dec. 31, 2022. During the same time frame, the average equity fund investor experienced an average annual return of about 6.81%. There are a few reasons why this happens. Here are just a couple of them: Investors who pay too much attention to the stock market tend to handicap their chances of success by trying to time the market too frequently. A simple long-term buy-and-hold strategy would have yielded far better results. Profits that result from the sale of any capital assets end up in a capital gain. This includes any personal assets, such as furniture, or investments like stocks, bonds, and real estate. An investor who sells a financial security after holding it for less than a year is taxed on any gains at a rate that's the same as ordinary income. These are referred to as short-term capital gains. Depending on the individual's adjusted gross income (AGI), this tax rate could be as high as 37%. Any securities that are sold after being held for more than a year result in long-term capital gains. The gains are taxed at a maximum rate of just 20%. Investors in lower tax brackets may even qualify for a 0% long-term capital gains tax rate. One of the main benefits of a long-term investment approach is money. Keeping your stocks in your portfolio longer is more cost-effective than regular buying and selling because the longer you hold your investments, the fewer fees you have to pay. But how much does this all cost? As we discussed in the last section, you save on taxes. Any gains from stock sales must be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). That ends up increasing your tax liability, which means more money out of your pocket. Remember, short-term capital gains can cost you more than if you hold your stocks for a longer period of time. Then there are trading or transaction fees. How much you pay depends on the type of account you have and the investment firm that handles your portfolio. For instance, you may be charged a commission or markup, where the former is deducted when you buy and sell through a broker while markups are charged when the sale is directed through their own inventory. These costs are charged to your account whenever you trade stocks. This means your portfolio balance will drop with every sale you make. In 2024, many active investors make trades through online brokerages that provide fee-free transactions. In these cases, you may not incur costs to complete some or all of your trades. However, it's still important for investors to weigh out the value of the time they spend on trades in comparison with the difference in performance between an active and a longer-term, buy-and-hold type of strategy. Firms often charge ongoing fees, such as account maintenance charges, that can also put a dent in your account balance. So if you're a regular trader with a short-term goal, your fees will add up even more when you factor in transaction fees. Dividends are corporate profits distributed by companies with a track record of success. These tend to be blue chips or defensive stocks. Defensive stocks are companies that do well regardless of how the economy performs or when the stock market drops. These companies pay regular dividends\u2014usually every quarter\u2014to eligible shareholders, which means that you get to share in their success. While it may be tempting to cash them out, there's a very good reason why you should reinvest the dividends into the companies that pay them. If you own any bonds or mutual funds, you'll know about how compound interest affects your investments. Compound interest is any interest calculated on the principal balance of your stock portfolio and any earlier interest you earned. This means that any interest (or dividends) that your stock portfolio accumulates compounds over time, thereby increasing the amount in your account in the long run. There are several things to consider when you want to purchase stocks. Consider your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals, among other things. Having a handle on all of this can help you figure out the kind of equity portfolio you can create in order to meet your goals. Here's a general guide you can follow as a starting point that you can tailor to your own situation: As always, it's a good idea to consult with a financial professional, especially if you're new to the investment world. If you're a millennial with your eyes on retirement, there are more resources here to help support your financial future. The IRS taxes capital gains based on short-term and long-term holdings. Short-term capital gains are taxed on assets sold within a single year of ownership while long-term gains are taxed on the sale of assets held for more than 12 months. Short-term capital gains are treated as ordinary income, which means you could be taxed as high as 37% based on your tax bracket. Long-term gains, on the other hand, are only subject to a tax of \u00a00%, 15%, or 20%. The rate depends on your adjusted gross income and filing status. As with any asset, you must hold a stock for a minimum of 12 months in order for it to be considered a long-term investment. Anything under that is deemed a short-term holding. How long you can wait until you sell the stock after buying it depends on the broker. Some firms require that you wait a certain amount of time (at least until the settlement date) to sell your stock. Others allow a certain number of same-day transactions within your account. People who make more than the allotted number of trades within the same day are considered day or pattern traders and are generally required to keep a minimum balance in their accounts. People who invest in stocks can benefit from many different trading strategies. Investors who have more experience and a higher amount of capital at their disposal may be able to ride the market waves and make money using short-term trading techniques. But that may not work for those who are just starting out or aren't able to tolerate too much risk. Holding stocks for the long-term can help you ride the highs and lows of the market and benefit from lower tax rates, and it tends to be less costly.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. They're easy to invest in, have low fees, and often perform very well Jim Makos / Flickr / CC BY 2.0 With a net worth of $148 billion, as of November 2024, Warren Buffett is one of the most successful investors of all time. His investing style, which is based on discipline, value, and patience, has yielded results that have consistently outperformed the market for decades. While regular investors\u2014that is, the rest of us\u2014don\u2019t have the money to invest the way Buffett does, we can follow one of his ongoing recommendations: Low-cost index funds are the smartest investment most people can make. As Buffett\u00a0wrote in a 2016 letter to shareholders, \u201cWhen trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients. Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds.\u201d If you\u2019re thinking about taking his advice, here\u2019s what you need to know about investing in index funds. An index fund is a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, with the goal of matching the performance of that benchmark as closely as possible. The S&P 500 is perhaps the most well-known index, but there are indexes\u2014and index funds\u2014for nearly every market and investment strategy you can think of. You can buy index funds through your brokerage account or directly from an index-fund provider, such as Fidelity. When you buy an index fund, you get a diversified selection of securities in one easy, low-cost investment. Some index funds provide exposure to thousands of securities in a single fund, which helps lower your overall risk through broad diversification. By investing in several index funds tracking different indexes you can built a portfolio that matches your desired asset allocation. For example, you might put 60% of your money in stock index funds and 40% in bond index funds. You can start investing in index funds with one of the best online brokers and trading platforms, such as the ones below: Very low fees Lower tax exposure Passive management tends to outperform over time Broad diversification No downside protection Doesn't take advantage of opportunities Cannot trim under-performers Lack of professional portfolio management The most obvious advantage of index funds is that they have consistently beaten other types of funds in terms of total return. One major reason is that they generally have much lower management fees than other funds because they are passively managed. Instead of having a manager actively trading, and a research team analyzing securities and making recommendations, the index fund\u2019s portfolio just duplicates that of its designated index. Index funds hold investments until the index itself changes (which doesn\u2019t happen very often), so they also have lower transaction costs. Those lower costs can make a big difference in your returns, especially over the long haul. \u201cHuge institutional investors, viewed as a group, have long underperformed the unsophisticated index-fund investor who simply sits tight for decades,\u201d wrote Buffett in his 2014 shareholder letter. \u201cA major reason has been fees: Many institutions pay substantial sums to consultants who, in turn, recommend high-fee managers. And that is a fool\u2019s game.\u201d What's more, by trading in and out of securities less frequently than actively managed fund do, index funds generate less taxable income that must be passed along to their shareholders. Index funds have still another tax advantage. Because they buy new lots of securities in the index whenever investors put money into the fund, they may have hundreds or thousands of lots to choose from when selling a particular security. That means they can sell the lots with the lowest capital gains and, therefore, the lowest tax bite. If you're shopping for index funds, be sure to compare their expense ratios. While index funds are usually cheaper than actively managed funds, some are cheaper than others. No investment is ideal, and that includes index funds. One drawback lies in their very nature: A portfolio that rises with its index falls with its index. If you have a fund that tracks the S&P 500, for example, you\u2019ll enjoy the heights when the market is doing well, but you\u2019ll be completely vulnerable when the market drops. In contrast, with an actively managed fund, the fund manager might sense a market correction coming and adjust or even liquidate the portfolio\u2019s positions to buffer it. It\u2019s easy to fuss about actively managed funds\u2019 fees. But sometimes the expertise of a good investment manager can not only protect a portfolio, but even outperform the market. However, few managers have been able to do that consistently, year after year. Also, diversification is a double-edged sword. It smooths out volatility and lessens risk, sure; but, as is so often the case, reducing the downside also limits the upside. The broad-based basket of stocks in an index fund may be dragged down by some underperformers, compared to a more cherry-picked portfolio in another fund. Index funds have several attractive pros but also some cons to consider. The funds are passive investments that track major indexes making them a low-cost investment option. These funds are nearly as automatic and hands-off as using a robo-advisor which is another option for those looking for low-cost investing. Understanding what an index fund is and how it compares to other investments is the best first step you can take.

            "content": "The S&P 500 consists of 500 companies that have issued a total of 503 stocks. Some companies, such as Alphabet, have issued multiple classes of shares. The top 10 largest holdings are listed on the official S&P Global website. An S&P 500 company must meet specific requirements to be included as a constituent within the index. However, S&P does not currently provide the total list of holdings, at least not for free. Subscribers to S&P's research unit, Capital IQ, can get access to the entire list. S&P 500 companies represent the top companies within their industries and are a gauge of U.S. economic activity. The S&P 500 was created in 1957 and is one of the most widely quoted stock market indexes. S&P 500 stocks represent the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. The S&P 500 focuses on the U.S. market's large-cap sector. An S&P 500 company must meet a broad set of criteria to be added to the index, including the following: Companies may be removed from the S&P 500 if they deviate substantially from these standards. The total combined market cap of the 503 constituents in the S&P 500 as of Aug. 31, 2023. The S&P 500 is a free-float market capitalization-weighted index. Market capitalization represents the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding equity shares. Market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares of stock by the company's current stock price. For example, a company with 20 million shares outstanding in which its stock is selling for $100 per share would have a market cap of $2 billion. As a result, the more valuable an individual company's stock becomes, the more it contributes to the S&P 500's overall return. It is not uncommon for three-quarters of the index's return to be linked to only 50 to 75 stocks. Therefore, the addition or subtraction of smaller companies from the index will not have a noticeable impact on the overall return of the index; however, the removal or addition of even just one of the largest stocks can have a major impact. Below are the top sectors and their weightings within the S&P 500 index as of Aug. 31, 2023. Being aware of the S&P's sector weighting is important because sectors with a smaller weighting may not have a material impact on the value of the overall index even if they're outperforming or underperforming the market. For example, if oil prices are rising, leading to increased profits for the energy sector, those stocks represent only 4.4% of the S&P 500. As a result, oil stocks may not lead to a higher S&P if, for example, the more heavily weighted information technology sector is underperforming. S&P 500 components are weighted by free-float market capitalization, which means that larger companies can affect the value of the index to a greater degree. Because the exact weightings of the top 25 components are not available from S&P directly, the weightings below are from the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY). SPY is the oldest exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 and holds $406.6 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of Sept. 20, 2023, and is highly traded. As a result, the SPY's portfolio weightings provide a good proxy for investing in the underlying S&P 500 index, although the two may not be exactly the same. As of Sept. 21, 2023, the following are the 25 largest S&P 500 index constituents by weight: Although there are generally 500 companies within the index, that number has grown. There were 503 stocks that made up the S&P 500 as of Aug. 31, 2023. That's because some companies have multiple classes of equity shares, such as Alphabet. A company must meet certain requirements for inclusion in the S&P 500, which include: Since the S&P 500 is an index, it can not be purchased directly; however, exchange-traded funds that mirror or track the index can be purchased, such as the State Street Global Advisors' SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY). The top 25 companies in the S&P 500 are some of the most well-known companies in the world, a large portion of the top 10 being tech companies, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Google. To invest in the companies in the index, investors can purchase the individual stocks of the companies or invest in a fund that tracks the S&P 500.

            "title": "When Stock Prices Drop, Where Is the Money?",
            "content": "Bloomberg\u00a0/\u00a0Contributor / Getty Images As stock prices plummet, investors often wonder where their money has gone. In truth, it hasn't vanished\u2014instead, the perceived value of their investment has changed. Stock price shifts are more about changing perceptions of value rather than money physically moving from one place to another. Say you buy 100 shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) at $150 each. Later, supply chain issues arise, or a new Apple product underperforms. As a result, investors lose confidence in Apple's future performance, and the stock price drops to $100 per share. While it might seem like you've \"lost\" $50 per share, that money didn't go anywhere. The price change simply reflects what investors are now willing to pay for Apple shares. It's like how a new car's value depreciates over time\u2014the actual vehicle hasn't changed, but its market value has. This \"paper loss\" only becomes real if you sell your shares at a lower price. Understanding this concept is crucial for navigating the often turbulent waters of the stock market without getting sunk. Stock prices are fundamentally driven by supply and demand. When demand for a stock is high, meaning more people want to buy than sell it, the price rises as buyers are willing to pay more. But when supply exceeds demand, meaning more people are selling than buying, the stock price tends to fall, as sellers are forced to lower their prices to attract buyers. This constant interaction between supply (the willingness to sell) and demand (the willingness to buy) drives prices and market trends. Let's look at what happens when prices for a stock are going up, using one of the most notable stock rises in recent memory. From 2020 to 2021, the stock price of Tesla (TSLA) surged over 700% despite the pandemic. Investors were bullish on Tesla's potential to dominate the electric vehicle market, its production expansion plans, and CEO Elon Musk's ambitious targets. By January 2021, Tesla's market capitalization was over $800 billion, making it one of the world's most valuable automakers. This occurred even though Tesla produced only about 509,000 vehicles in 2020, far fewer than traditional automakers like Toyota and Volkswagen. Let's now review an example of a stock falling in price. In January 2022, Netflix (NFLX) reported disappointing subscriber growth for the fourth quarter of 2021, adding only 8.3 million new subscribers versus the expected 8.5 million. This might not seem like an astounding shortfall, but the news, coupled with concerns about rising competition, caused Netflix's stock to plummet 21.8% in a single day. Investors were worried about slowing growth and potential market share loss to competitors like Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max. Over the following months, Netflix's stock continued to fall as the company reported continued poor subscriber growth in the first half of 2022. By April 2022, Netflix's stock had dropped almost 70% from its all-time high. More needs to be said, though, about why prices fall, not just that they go down. Stock prices are influenced not just by a company's actual performance, which is part of its fundamentals, but by how investors perceive its prospects. Positive news, such as strong earnings reports or industry advances, can increase demand and higher prices. Negative news, like missed earnings targets or economic downturns, creates fear or uncertainty about stocks, leading to increased selling and lower prices. Let's go through the major reasons you can see a fall in the price of a stock: When a stock's price decreases, it affects investors in several ways. First, a decline in a stock's price directly reduces the market value of their holdings. For instance, if Apple's stock drops from $150 to $140, an investor with 100 shares loses $1,000 in market value. Price drops also trigger fear and uncertainty among investors, leading to panic selling and creating a feedback loop of further price declines. We saw this in our example above when, in early 2022, Netflix's stock plummeted over 21% in one day after disappointing subscriber growth, prompting many investors to sell. It's not that the intrinsic value changed immensely in a day, but that negative sentiment fed upon itself. This happens because a falling stock price can negatively influence perceptions of a company's health, leading to a further loss of confidence and stock price declines. That said, investors react differently to price declines. Some view them as buying opportunities, believing the stock is now undervalued. Others may decide to cut their losses and sell. During the 2022 market correction, for example, some investors saw a drop in the price of Tesla's stock from its 2021 highs as a chance to buy at a discount. When a company reports lower-than-expected earnings, profits, or revenue, it signals to investors that the business is underperforming. This very often leads to a sell-off as shareholders lose confidence in the company\u2019s ability to grow, pushing stock prices lower. Missed earnings targets or profit warnings are key triggers for price declines. Stock prices are a reflection of collective investor expectations. When those expectations change, so do stock prices. During periods of economic downturn or recession, consumer spending decreases, and business investments slow down. As companies experience reduced revenues and potential layoffs, their stock values tend to fall. Investors often pull out of equities in favor of safer assets, compounding the decline. Below is chart showing the S&P 500 performance during recessions (along with major declines that didn't occur during or right before them): When central banks raise interest rates, borrowing becomes more expensive for companies and consumers alike. Higher interest rates usually reduce corporate profits and consumer spending, which can drag down stock prices. In addition, rising rates make bonds and other fixed-income investments more attractive, leading investors to shift away from stocks. The psychological impact of losing money in stocks can be significant. Successful investors learn to manage their emotions and stick to their long-term investment strategies, even during market downturns. Geopolitical risks such as wars, trade conflicts, or political instability can create uncertainty in financial markets. Investors often react to these risks by selling stocks, fearing economic disruption or volatility. This uncertainty can lead to widespread market declines, particularly in sectors sensitive to changes in global trade and security. When large institutional investors sell substantial portions of their holdings, it can increase supply in the market, driving down prices. Such moves may be triggered by portfolio rebalancing or reactions to market conditions. These visible transactions can instill fear among smaller investors, leading to further declines. Each industry has specific challenges, such as regulatory changes, supply chain disruptions, or technological obsolescence. For instance, stricter environmental regulations could hurt the energy sector, while rapid technological advances could render products obsolete in industries like telecommunications. While short-term price declines can be unsettling, they often create prospects for long-term investors. It's important to distinguish between temporary market noise and fundamental changes in a company's prospects. When a stock's price falls, the market value of the stock decreases, effectively \"erasing\" some of the perceived value. This lost value isn't transferred elsewhere; it reflects a shift in what investors believe the stock is worth, driven by changing expectations and sentiment. In short, your loss isn't necessarily someone else's gain. The lost value in a stock's decline reflects a decrease in the company's market capitalization. When a stock's price drops because of decreased demand and negative investor sentiment, the company's overall market value\u2014calculated as the stock price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares\u2014shrinks. Here are other effects: Lower stock prices can also affect long-term returns. For long-term investors, a significant drop can take years to recover, potentially delaying or reducing overall investment returns. However, stocks are historically resilient and bounce back after market declines, usually within a few months to a few years. You can take several measures to prepare for potential stock market corrections or for a partial decline in your stock portfolio value: The buy-and-hold strategy involves buying stocks and holding them for the long term, regardless of market fluctuations. Using this approach, investors ride out market volatility. This has often been the right move since, historically, stock prices have trended higher. Investors should avoid the pitfalls of panic selling during downturns by focusing on long-term growth rather than short-term price movements. This strategy is particularly effective for investors who believe in the fundamental strength of their investments and have a time horizon that allows them to weather market storms. Broad market indexes such as the S&P 500 are composed of hundreds of companies varying in industry, operational strategy, and sometime size, depending on the index. Investing in these types of indexes is a simple way to diversify. One of the best ways to prepare for a stock market correction or crash is by diversifying your portfolio. Holding a mix of assets\u2014stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities\u2014helps spread risk. When one asset class declines, others may hold steady or increase in value and this protects your overall portfolio. Diversification across sectors, geographies, and company sizes further mitigates risk during market downturns. Holding part of your portfolio in cash or cash equivalents gives you a lot of flexibility during market corrections. You can take advantage of lower stock prices by buying quality assets at lower prices. Cash reserves also act as a safety net, ensuring you don't need to sell other assets at a loss during a downturn. You should also have an emergency fund that ensures you have liquid assets available in case of personal financial difficulties or during market crashes when stock values are down. Having three-to-six months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside in a high-yield savings account allows you to avoid selling investments at a loss in volatile markets. Implementing risk management techniques, such as setting stop-loss orders or using options strategies, can help protect your investments during market downturns. Stop-loss orders automatically sell stocks when they reach a certain price, limiting potential losses. Options strategies, such as buying put options, can provide insurance against declines in stock prices. Options are financial derivatives that give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed-upon price, until a specified date. If you own a stock and want to reduce how badly any losses might affect you, you could hedge your risk by selling put options against your shares. Defensive stocks\u2014such as those in the consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare sectors\u2014tend to perform better during economic downturns and market corrections. These companies provide essential goods and services, making them less vulnerable to shifts in economic conditions. When evaluating a company's worth, investors consider two main types of value: intrinsic and market. Otherwise called the fundamental value, intrinsic value is what's taken to be an objective estimate of a stock's actual worth. These are used to assess its value: Here are the essential characteristics of intrinsic value: Market value is the current price at which a stock trades in the market. It represents what investors are willing to pay for the stock at a given time. Key points about market value: Based on a fundamental analysis of the company Used for assessing future potential and growth prospects. More stable over time Objective, though it can vary based on analyst assumptions Based on the trading price in the stock market Reflects what investors are willing to pay at a given time Can be highly volatile Subjective, influenced by market sentiment and trends Another crucial distinction is between unrealized and realized losses. These concepts have different implications for your portfolio and taxes. Unrealized or \"paper losses,\" occur when the market value of a stock decreases, but the asset hasn't been sold yet. For example, if you bought 100 shares at $50 each, your total investment is $5,000. If the stock price drops to $30 per share, the market value is $3,000, producing an unrealized loss of $2,000. The loss is called \"unrealized\" because it exists only on paper; you still hold the shares and could see the stock recover in time. Investors looking to offset gains from other assets may opt to sell stocks in a losing position to offset them for tax purposes. This is called tax-loss harvesting. Unrealized losses don't have immediate tax implications because they aren't recognized until the shares are sold. Many investors hold onto their investments during market downturns, hoping prices will rebound and allow them to make up for their losses. Those who believe a company's fundamentals are stronger than the stock price often do this. Meanwhile, realized losses occur when an investor sells an asset for less than its purchase price. Going back to the example above, if you sell 100 shares at $30 each, you would receive $3,000. Since you originally invested $5,000, this ends in a realized loss of $2,000. Unlike unrealized losses, realized losses must be reported on tax returns and can affect your taxable income by lowering it. That's good for tax purposes since it might offset realized gains from other investments. However, once a loss is realized, there's no chance of recovery from that specific investment unless the investor decides to repurchase the stock. The decision to realize a loss or continue holding an investment depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and overall market outlook. While unrealized losses may recover over time if the stock price rebounds, realized losses provide certainty and potential tax benefits. However, they eliminate the possibility of gaining from the stock recovering afterward. Definition: Loss that exists on paper because you haven't sold the stock. Affect on your portfolio: Reduces the paper value of your portfolio, but has no immediate financial impact. Tax implications: No tax impact since no transaction has occurred. Potential for recovery: The stock could recover and turn into a profit if held longer. Definition: Actual loss that occurs when you sell the stock for less than you paid. Affect on your portfolio: Results in a reduction of your investment capital. Tax implications: Can be used to offset capital gains or reduce taxable income. Potential for recovery: No chance of recovery on the realized loss unless you reinvest. Short selling is a trading strategy where investors bet on the decline of a stock's price. It involves borrowing shares of a stock from a broker and selling them immediately at the market price. The short seller aims to buy back the shares later at a lower price, return them to the broker, and pocket the difference. Here are the steps in how short sellers profit: However, if a stock price rises instead of falling, the potential losses for short sellers are unlimited, since they would have to buy the shares back at a much higher price. Stock price declines don't always reflect a company's intrinsic value. It's crucial to understand the difference between short-term market reactions and fundamental changes in a company's prospects. Short selling can have both direct and indirect effects on regular long investors. When investors take short positions, they are essentially betting that a stock\u2019s price will fall. As a result, significant short-selling activity can create downward pressure on the stock price, negatively affecting long-term investors holding the stock. However, short selling can also benefit long investors in certain scenarios. Short sellers often help expose overvalued stocks or companies with questionable fundamentals, which could prevent long investors from holding onto a poor investment for too long. In addition, when short sellers eventually cover their positions by buying back shares, this can create upward momentum in the stock price, potentially leading to a price recovery that benefits long-term shareholders. Unlike options trading, where another's loss directly offsets one party's gain, the stock market is not a zero-sum game. In stock investing, many investors can benefit from a company's growth and success. One exception is options trading. When an investor buys a call option on stock XYZ with a strike price of $50 for $5, they're betting the stock price will rise above $55 (strike price plus premium). If the stock reaches $60, the option buyer profits $5 per share, while the option seller loses the same amount. This direct correlation between profit and loss defines something as a zero-sum game. The stock market operates differently. When a company performs well and its stock price increases, all shareholders benefit without directly causing losses to others\u2014the rising tide lifts all boats. For instance, if Company ABC's stock rises from $100 to $150, every shareholder sees their investment value increase. This is quintessential to what market proponents call \"value creation.\" In addition, stocks can generate value through dividends and buybacks, further distinguishing them from zero-sum investments. When a company pays dividends, it distributes profits to shareholders without necessarily reducing the value of others' holdings. Similarly, stock buybacks can increase the value of remaining shares without directly disadvantaging any particular group of investors. However, while the stock market isn't zero-sum in the long term, short-term trading and speculation can sometimes resemble zero-sum activities. Day or high-frequency traders might engage in transactions where one party's gain more closely mirrors another's loss. However, these activities are a small fraction of the overall stock market. Stock market crashes provide stark examples of how massive value can seemingly disappear from the market in a short period. Two of the most notable crashes in U.S. history\u2014the 1929 crash and the 2008 financial crisis\u2014illustrate how stocks aren't a zero-sum game in the other direction either: stock price drops destroy value without anyone necessarily gaining. The stock market crash of 1929 marked the beginning of the Great Depression. On Black Monday, October 28, 1929, the stock market fell nearly 13% in a single day. The following day, on October 29, 1929, known as Black Tuesday, the stock market fell again nearly 12%. Between September 1, and November 30th 1929, the market's value declined from $64 billion to around $30 billion. The loss of $34 billion in value is equivalent to over $626 billion in 2024 dollars. This catastrophic decline was fueled by rampant speculation, overleveraging, and a lack of regulatory oversight. As stock prices fell, investor confidence evaporated, leading to panic selling. By 1932, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 89% from its peak in 1929. The repercussions were felt throughout the economy: businesses failed, banks collapsed, and unemployment soared to around 25%. Fast forward to 2008, when the global financial crisis began with a sharp decline in housing prices and widespread defaults on subprime mortgages. As financial institutions became increasingly exposed to these toxic assets, confidence in the banking system eroded. In September 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, marking a pivotal moment that sent shock waves through financial markets worldwide. The S&P 500 index fell from its peak in October 2007 to its trough in March 2009. During this period, an estimated $17 trillion in household wealth evaporated because of falling stock prices and declining home values. The crisis resulted in severe economic consequences: unemployment peaked at around 10%, millions lost their homes and consumer spending plummeted, causing massive ripple effects in just about every part of the economy. The government intervened with unprecedented measures such as the Troubled Asset Relief Program and aggressive monetary policies, including quantitative easing, to stabilize the economy. One of the most important things to do is remain calm and consider both the time frame for your investment\u00a0and the reason you bought\u00a0the stock in the first place. Stocks can have a lot of short-term volatility following announcements and other events. You can certainly revisit or potentially change your investment based on these developments. If a sell-off occurs, it might represent a buying opportunity for you and a chance to add to your long position at a relatively low price rather than selling with the crowd. The main point is to practice trading discipline and keep your eye on long-term, not short-term, volatility. Short sellers profit by borrowing shares and selling them at the current higher price, then buying them back later at a lower price. The difference between the higher selling price and the lower repurchase price is their profit. Psychological factors include fear, greed, herd behavior, and overreaction to news. These emotions can drive investors to buy or sell irrationally, causing market prices to fluctuate beyond what fundamentals would suggest. When stock prices drop, the perceived disappearance of money is primarily a result of changing investor perceptions and market dynamics rather than an actual loss of capital. A decline in stock prices indicates a shift in supply and demand, often driven by negative sentiment or disappointing news, leading to more sellers than buyers. This creates the illusion that money has vanished. However, it simply reflects reduced market capitalization because of lower investor demand. The \"lost\" value isn't transferred to anyone but represents a collective reassessment of the company's worth. Understanding this concept is crucial for navigating the often turbulent waters of the stock market. Investors should remember that unrealized losses only become real if shares are sold at a lower price.

            "title": "S&P 500 Average Return and Historical Performance",
            "content": "J.B. Maverick is an active trader, commodity futures broker, and stock market analyst 17+ years of experience, in addition to 10+ years of experience as a finance writer and book editor. The S&P 500 is a\u00a0market capitalization-weighted index\u00a0of the 500 leading\u00a0publicly traded companies in the U.S. The index is operated by Standard & Poor's Dow Jones Indices, which is a division of S&P Global. While it assumed its present size (and name) in 1957, the S&P dates back to the 1920s, becoming a composite index tracking 90 stocks in 1926. The average annualized return since its inception in 1928 through Dec. 31, 2023, is 9.90%. The average annualized return since adopting 500 stocks into the index in 1957 through Dec. 31, 2023, is 10.26%. The average annual return (AAR) is the percentage showing the return of a mutual fund in a given period. In other words, it measures a fund's long-term performance, so it's a vital tool for investors considering a mutual fund investment. Inflation is one of the major problems for an investor hoping to recreate that 10.13% average return regularly. Adjusted for inflation, the historical average annual return is only around 6.37%. There is an additional problem posed by the question of whether that inflation-adjusted average is accurate since the adjustment is made using the inflation figures from the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the index that some analysts believe vastly understates the true inflation rate. Another major factor in annual returns for an investor in the S&P 500 is when they choose to enter the market. For example, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which duplicates the index, performed very well for an investor who bought between 2014 and 2018 despite some negativity in their returns between 2020 and 2023. Investors who buy during market lows and hold their investment or sell at market highs will experience larger returns than those who buy during market highs, particularly if they sell during dips. Attempting to time the market is not advised, particularly for beginning investors. Stock purchase timing plays a role in returns, but there are long periods between lows and highs. It is also difficult to know or predict these events. For those who want to avoid the missed opportunity of selling during market lows but don't want the risk of active trading, dollar-cost averaging is an option. The number of stocks listed on the S&P 500. The total number tends to vary because there may be several companies with multiple share classes. These include Google, Meta Platforms, and Berkshire Hathaway. You can\u2019t invest in the S&P 500 directly because it is a stock market index, not an individual stock or fund you can buy. However, you can purchase the stock of S&P Global (SPGI), the company that maintains the index. You can also purchase one of every stock listed on the S&P 500, but you'll need quite a bit of capital to do so\u2014it might cost around $3,000 to purchase only one of each of the top 10 stocks on the index. For most people, the simplest and most affordable option for investing in the S&P 500 is to buy shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or index fund that mirrors it. In these instruments, a company builds a portfolio of stocks that mirror the S&P 500 index, securitizes and fractionalizes those stocks, and offers them as shares of a fund you can buy. These funds are often provided at a much lower cost than if you were to buy one of every stock on the index to get similar performance. The first step to investing in the index is to open an account with a reputable brokerage firm such as Vanguard, Fidelity, or Charles Schwab. Modern brokers have easy-to-use online platforms, where you can buy and sell most types of investments for minimal or no fees. Then, look over the brokers' products and find an ETF or index fund that mirrors the S&P 500. Some examples are: The average annualized return of the S&P 500 between 2003 and 2023 is 10.20%. The average rate of return for the S&P 500 since 2013 is 13.05%. As calculated, S&P 500 returns do not include dividends. However, you can find results from some analysts that include dividends. The list put together by NYU Stern School of Business finance professor Aswath Damodaran is one example. The S&P 500 is the standard for measuring overall market returns. There have been many ups and downs in its century of existence, but generally, the index has produced returns over the long run. Since its inception, it has returned 9.81%. You can invest in the S&P 500 using index funds and exchange-traded funds that mimic the index and not pay as much as you would for each stock. Investing in funds that track the S&P 500 is a long game, not for the faint of heart\u2014many investors have lost everything by panic selling during a dip. If you're looking for an investment with a long-standing history of decent long-term returns, S&P 500 funds might be a suitable choice for your portfolio.

            "title": "5 Stocks Kicked Off the S&P 500 That Have Outperformed the Index",
            "content": "Daniel Liberto is a journalist with over 10 years of experience working with publications such as the Financial Times, The Independent, and Investors Chronicle. SOPA Images / Getty Images In the U.S., winners get trophies and parades, while losers go away to think about all that went wrong. So it's no surprise that in 2020, when Apartment Investment and Management (AIV) was unceremoniously shoved aside to make room for Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) to join the S&P 500 index, it was expected the company's management would go off into obscurity while Tesla got treated to triumphal front-page reporting. Yet, in the six months after Tesla replaced it, AIV had an 80% better relative return. While AIV, like the rest of the real estate industry, later struggled as interest rates spiked in the early 2020s, its stock price is still up about 60% since then. And AIV isn't alone. While newly crowned S&P 500 companies often strain under the weight of expectations, the outcasts have historically outperformed the market by as much as 5% annually over the following five years. It's a reminder that in investing, as in sports, sometimes the most compelling comeback stories begin with a setback. In this article, we tell the tale of five of those companies\u2014each of which has outperformed the index since leaving it. We also undo some of the myths still out there about the price bumps companies can expect when joining the S&P 500 index. Getting booted off an index isn't something associated with success. Being included, particularly today when so much of the market is given over to passive investing, is said to improve one's share price, all but automatically. It also increases the company's visibility and credibility, showing everyone that the company is one of the best and biggest in the country. However, there could be a silver lining to getting dumped. Research supports the idea that many companies removed from the S&P 500 index outperform the market. A key study conducted by Research Affiliates found that stocks taken out of the S&P 500 between 1990 and 2022 outperformed those that were added by over 5% annually in the five years afterward. The authors of the study argued that this outperformance is partly driven by how the outcasts are immediately undervalued because of excessive selling after being dropped\u200b. These and other researchers speculate this pattern is mainly triggered by the recognition that additions are overpriced and deletions are undervalued. Heavy buying activity eventually creates a situation where companies added to the index trade on price-to-earnings ratios that are too frothy, causing investors to dump them. In addition, after the initial decline, stocks kicked out of indexes tend to be excessively punished by the market. Over time, they recover and can provide better returns, as the market eventually corrects its overreaction\u200b. This suggests that while being removed from the index initially harms share prices, some companies bounce back as contrarian investors step in, finding value in these beaten-down stocks. The market has a tendency to throw a parade for S&P 500 additions while holding a funeral for removals\u2014and that emotional overreaction often creates prospects for investors. But there's another reason stocks that are dumped by the S&P 500 might be counterintuitively doing well afterward. People on Wall Street tend to repeat claims about an \"index effect\" that's no longer operative. In other words, if it's not true that those joining the index see much of a bump in their stock price in the first place, then it follows that those leaving it will often have a better performance, all else being equal. Still, the oft-repeated story about the stock price benefit of joining the S&P index seems perfectly logical. Joining the S&P 500 should profoundly influence share prices when you consider the index's role in modern investing. The world's most widely tracked index has trillions of dollars invested in funds that track its performance. Anyone who joins it sees its stock bought up by hundreds of index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). When a stock gets removed, those funds must sell it. This automatic trading should create significant price swings. Getting removed from the S&P 500 is a very public demotion, potentially affecting everything from employee morale to customer perception. The impact should go beyond this since being in the S&P 500 is like having a spotlight on your company. It brings increased visibility, media coverage, and analyst attention. Companies that join the index often see a boost in their public image and credibility\u2014it's like joining the major leagues of American business. On the other hand, being removed from the index can be seen as a red flag that a company is old news, which should lead to a snowballing of negative sentiment and lower investor confidence. One study found that if you created an index of the S&P 500 outcasts and invested in them from 1991 to the end of 2023, your gains would have been an average annual rate of 14.0% versus 10.6% for the S&P 500. Using our own figures to make the difference clearer, since minor percentage differences add up quickly because of compounding, $100 invested over those 33 years would become about $7,500 in the outcast index (neglecting commissions, taxes, and fees). If you stuck with the \"winners,\" you'd have about $2,800 from investing in the S&P 500 index. Taking this all together, it's said to be inevitable that removal from the S&P 500 will cause a company's share price to fall, especially in the initial few months. For that reason, various pundits recommend steering clear of these stocks, including CNBC's Jim Cramer. \u201cWhen you see a stock that gets expelled from the S&P 500, please don\u2019t bother to try to catch a bottom\u2014you\u2019re most likely catching a falling knife,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cHistorically, the odds are very much against you. If Standard & Poor\u2019s doesn\u2019t want them, well, you probably shouldn\u2019t want them either.\u201d But like many stories taken to be so obvious on Wall Street, the numbers tell another tale. As research from the National Bureau of Economic Research shows\u2014backed up by other deep dives into the data\u2014there once was a strong index effect. In the 1980s and 1990s, stocks added to the S&P 500 had strong, positive, and abnormal returns (about 3.4% in the 1980s and 7.6% in the 1990s). Meanwhile, stocks removed from the index had steep declines\u2014about -4.6% in the 1980s and -16.6% in the 1990s. The S&P 500 index is rebalanced quarterly, usually on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. However, studies started appearing in the 2000s showing a massive decline in these effects. By the 2010s, stocks added to the index had only a small 0.8% rise\u2014some studies had it at a minuscule 0.1%\u2014and stocks removed from it had almost no abnormal returns (-0.6%). In the 2020s, the differences between being in and out of the index, all else being equal, seems to be pretty close to statistically insignificant. How could this be? After all, it's true that there should be higher demand for stocks that are added to the index. Analysts have suggested several reasons: The S&P 500 is set up to represent the largest and most influential companies in the U.S. economy. To maintain its status, the index must adapt to changes in the market by adding companies that better reflect the economic landscape and removing those that no longer meet the criteria. This selection process is overseen by a committee at S&P Global, which meets quarterly to evaluate companies in the index and make adjustments as needed. Changes to the index are typically announced with several days' notice to give index funds and other market participants time to prepare. To be considered for the S&P 500, a company must meet several requirements: Meeting these requirements, however, doesn\u2019t guarantee inclusion; the S&P 500 committee exercises discretion to ensure companies selected are truly representative of the large-cap U.S. market. More immediate action can also be taken if, for example, a company is taken over or delisted, or if it files for bankruptcy. In such cases, the stock would be immediately removed from the S&P 500 and replaced with another company. Previously, those removed from the S&P 500 did better than in the last decade, at least in terms of outperforming the index. This is mainly because of the outsized performance of tech stocks included in the index and rotation away from value investing. By now, we shouldn't be so surprised that stocks that have been dropped by the S&P 500 have gone on to do well. But which companies are the standouts in this category? Here are a few, featuring share price performance data as of market close on Nov. 6, 2024: Sentiment in regional banks took a hit in 2023 after Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic went out of business. Salt Lake City-headquartered Zion Bank got caught in the crossfire, shedding value and eventually getting kicked out of the S&P 500. Zion\u2019s downtrend turned out to be short-lived. An improving economic outlook and the U.S. Federal Reserve's move to cut interest rates have since boosted the sector, along with Zion. In fact, Zion\u2019s stock began its rally around October 2023, when news started spreading that it may get the boot. A challenging couple of years for Lincoln Capital led its share price to plummet and market cap to fall way below the S&P 500\u2019s threshold. The life insurer was another firm affected by Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s collapse. It also faced an uptick in pandemic-related mortalities and a host of other challenges, all of which weighed on its balance sheet and left it in a precarious financial position. The company has since been in recovery mode. Business has been improving, management has a better handle on costs, and investors have begun to notice, bidding the once-downtrodden shares up significantly over the past year. Lumen Technologies has come some way since getting booted from the S&P 500 in March 2023. A previous decision to shun the wireless market to expanding its wireline business through mergers and acquisitions was hurting its bottom line. The telecom company ended up saddled with debt and forced to suspend its dividend, prompting shareholders to bolt, its market capitalization to shrink, and its status as an S&P 500 company to disappear. Lumen is working to boost its enterprise offerings, with a specific focus on large and midmarket enterprises in North America, and leveraging new partnerships to support AI network capacity. However, the explosion in artificial intelligence (AI) and a series of contract wins, including with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), boosted sales and got investors cautiously optimistic again about the company's prospects. PVH is a cyclical stock known for its volatility. The owner of brands that include Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, it's had a rough few years facing changes in consumer tastes, the post-pandemic hike in interest rates, and widely shared problems in the retail clothing market. Now that borrowing costs are falling and recession fears are easing, investors are once again looking at the company and its diversified portfolio of well-known, popular brands. The company\u2019s broad global reach, cost discipline, investment in technology, and depressed valuation have also helped revive interest in the stock. We now return to where we began, with Apartment Investment and Management, which was replaced by Tesla in the S&P 500 at the end of 2020. Tesla is a much better-known stock, but AIV has, at times, been the better performer. The real estate investment trust acquires, manages, and redevelops residential apartments, and has been benefiting from rising demand for real estate and falling interest rates. The S&P 500 can add or remove companies whenever it wants. The index is rebalanced quarterly, so that is the most obvious time for changes to be made. However, the committee that decides who should be in the index can make changes at any time. For example, if a company in the S&P 500 were to be taken over or delisted, it would be replaced before the ordinary revision date. Stocks removed from the S&P 500 in 2024 include American Airlines Group (AAL), Etsy Inc. (ETSY), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO), Robert Half Inc. (RHI), Comerica Inc. (CMA), and Bath & Body Works Inc. (BBWI). Stocks added to the S&P 500 in 2024 include Amentum Holdings Inc. (AMTM), Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR), Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL), and CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD). There is no set number, which varies each year. For example, in 2024, 12 companies were removed, while in 2023, 15 companies got the boot. When a stock gets removed from the S&P 500, some investors think of heading for the exits\u2014but this knee-jerk reaction could mean leaving money on the table. While conventional wisdom suggests avoiding these corporate outcasts, historical data reveals a surprising twist: companies removed from the index have often staged impressive comebacks, overall outperforming the market by as much as 5% annually in the five years following their removal. This counterintuitive pattern highlights a fundamental principle of investing: the best opportunities often emerge when everyone else is running in the opposite direction. While getting booted from the S&P 500 can trigger automatic selling by index funds and negative headlines, it can also force companies to make tough but necessary changes. These stocks often trade at far less than their previous highs, meaning less optimism is priced in and there's more potential upside if the company turns things around.

However, it's not uncommon for companies to sometimes be delisted from this prestigious index. In fact, the average life span of a company on the S&P 500 is about 21 years. Delisting can occur for several reasons and may have immediate negative consequences for the company and its investors, affecting stock prices and market perceptions. Understanding what happens when a stock is delisted from the S&P 500 is crucial for investors and stakeholders. Read on to better understand the reasons behind delisting, its impact, and how recent examples shed light on this aspect of the stock market. The S&P 500, short for Standard & Poor's 500, is one of the most widely followed stock market indexes in the world. It represents the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S. Along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Nasdaq composite, the S&P 500 is considered one of the main benchmarks of the U.S. stock market's health and performance. The index is host to many of the world's most important companies and household names, including the following (by market cap weight as of the fourth quarter of 2024): The S&P 500 has specific criteria for including companies in the index. While the choice by S&P 500 about inclusion is more than just specific measures, these are the main thresholds a company must meet: The S&P 500 is not simply a list of the 500 largest companies by market capitalization. The inclusion process involves careful consideration by the index committee. They meet quarterly to review which companies to add or drop. The committee also monitors for significant developments (such as mergers, bankruptcies, or restructuring) that might affect index composition. While meeting the inclusion criteria is necessary, it doesn't guarantee being included. The committee has discretion when adding new companies. When adding or removing companies, the committee aims to decrease index turnover while ensuring the index represents the large-cap U.S. equity market. The index's composition changes are typically announced with several days' notice. This allows index funds and other market participants time to prepare for the change. Companies can be removed from the S&P 500 for various reasons, which we can broadly categorize into voluntary and involuntary delistings: Some companies delist themselves from the S&P 500 or other major indexes. Reasons for voluntary delisting include the following: More commonly, companies are involuntarily removed from the S&P 500 because of failing to meet the index's criteria. Reasons can include the following: When a stock is removed from the S&P 500, it typically has significant effects on the stock and its investors. Short-Term Consequences: Long-Term Consequences: Companies that fall out of the S&P 500 can be included again. For example, Dell was in the S&P 500 before going private in\u00a02013. The company was relisted in the index Sept. 23, 2024, to mark its 40th anniversary. Being added to the S&P 500 is often a significant achievement for a company. It brings several benefits, many of which are the opposite of being removed from the index: Here are several of the major companies removed from the index in 2024: Whirlpool, a major U.S. manufacturer of home appliances, was removed from the S&P 500 index in early 2024. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of American Airlines (AAL) from the S&P 500 in 2024 reflected broader challenges facing the airline industry and the company's specific financial struggles. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of Etsy Inc. (ETSY) from the S&P 500 was driven by changes in consumer behavior and ever more competition in ecommerce. Reasons for delisting: Effects: Other companies removed from the S&P 500 in 2024 include the following firms: As companies are moved out of the S&P 500 index, new companies are added to take their place. In 2024, the following were some of those added: You don't get your money back when a stock is removed from the index. You still own the same number of shares in the company. However, the value of those shares may decrease, and it may become more difficult to sell them. Index funds are mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. It provides investors with broad market exposure and typically offers lower fees than actively managed funds, as it simply mimics the composition of the chosen index rather than trying to outperform it. This depends on your investment strategy and the specific circumstances of the stock's removal. Stock prices are often negatively affected following its removal. In any case, it's important to reassess the company's fundamentals and prospects. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice if needed. Being delisted from the S&P 500 is a significant event for any company, often leading to immediate and negative consequences, such as a drop in stock price and reduced visibility. It can be voluntary because of a merger, going private, a falling market cap, or not meeting other index criteria. However, it's important to remember that delisting doesn't necessarily mean a company is doomed to fail. Some companies use this as a chance to restructure, refocus, and potentially return more robust than before. For investors, a stock's delisting from the S&P 500 should prompt a careful reassessment of the investment.

            "title": "The Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks Over the Past 30 Years Might Surprise You",
            "content": "ANGELA WEISS\u00a0/\u00a0Contributor / Getty Images When analyzing the top-performing stocks over the past three decades, it's striking that the leaders are not all from the technology sector. While tech powerhouses such as NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) have undeniably driven exceptional returns, standout performers exist in many less-expected industries. Other top performers include firms in healthcare, consumer discretionary, and consumer staples. This underscores the value of diversification. In addition, it reminds us that the pull of tech stocks often overshadows specific industries like apparel, footwear retail, and homebuilding. By broadening their focus beyond tech, investors can still identify long-term prospects in these often-overlooked industries. To assess the long-term performance of U.S. stocks, we selected stocks from the S&P 500 index because it represents large, established companies that are leaders in their respective industries. Each stock's 30-year price returns were calculated to provide a comprehensive view of historical growth, resilience, and volatility. Focusing on a time horizon of 30 years captures various economic cycles and provides a better understanding of how these companies navigated changing market conditions. Over the past 30 years, various companies across various sectors have demonstrated remarkable growth and resilience, evolving into industry leaders with significant market influence. From ResMed's (RMD) pioneering digital health products to Ross Stores' (ROST) success in off-price retail, to Pool Corporation's (POOL) leadership in backyard products, and Biogen Inc.'s (BIIB) neurological therapies, these companies show the broad opportunities available beyond traditional technology stocks. In addition, giants like Amazon and NVIDIA have transformed their industries, while firms like Netflix and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST) have led shifts in consumer behavior. Founded in 1989, ResMed has grown from a small startup focused on sleep disorders to a multinational corporation at the forefront of digital health products for sleep and breathing-related conditions. ResMed's core business involves devices that treat sleep apnea, a disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. The company's continuous positive airway pressure (better known by its acronym, CPAP) machines and masks have become ubiquitous in the industry. RMD operates through two key segments: sleep and respiratory care, which focuses on devices for managing sleep and breathing disorders, and software as a service (SaaS), which provides a business management platform for out-of-hospital healthcare providers. Many of the companies on this page can claim such outsized returns over the past three decades because they were, at points, penny stocks\u2014those that trade below $5 per share. Many penny stocks, including those from these companies, spent time traded over the counter, not on the major American exchanges. ResMed's journey from a sleep apnea startup to a major international firm reflects the evolving landscape of respiratory care, which has shifted to at-home technologies for an aging population. The company's focus on connected devices, software, and cloud-based products has positioned it at the intersection of healthcare and technology. Over the years, ResMed has continually updated its CPAP machines, making them more compact, quiet, and user-friendly. The introduction of its AutoSet technology in the 1990s, which automatically adjusts air pressure based on the patient's needs, marked a significant leap in these machines since it enabled more personalized and comfortable treatments. In the early 2000s, ResMed diversified beyond sleep apnea into broader respiratory care, targeting patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other chronic respiratory conditions. This expansion helped the company tap into the growing demand for non-invasive ventilation devices, especially in home care settings\u2014these would have even more impact when used for some patients after the pandemic hit in 2020. ResMed\u2019s acquisition of Ventilation Solutions and other respiratory-focused companies further strengthened its portfolio in this space. In the 2010s, ResMed also began shifting toward connected devices and software products. The launch of AirView in 2014, a cloud-based platform for remotely monitoring sleep apnea and respiratory care patients, was pivotal in this. This platform allowed healthcare providers and consumers to track patients in real time. Over the past three decades, ResMed has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy to expand its product portfolio and market presence. Most notably, the company acquired the German healthcare company CuraMed in the late 1990s and the U.S. software company Brightree in 2016. The company further expanded its product portfolio through acquisitions like German healthcare company Medifox Dan in 2022. Ross Stores, the parent company of Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS, has grown significantly over the past several decades. Focused on offering name-brand apparel and home d\u00e9cor at discounted prices, Ross has consistently expanded its footprint across the U.S., becoming one of the largest off-price retail chains. Despite challenges faced by brick-and-mortar retailers, including the global recession in 2008 and the rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon, Ross maintained profitability through its off-price strategy. The company had consistent revenue and earnings growth, especially between 2010 and 2019. Post-pandemic, Ross and other off-price retailers are growing off trends among younger shoppers. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Ross aggressively expanded, first in the Midwest and then throughout the country. This steady increase has allowed Ross to solidify its presence in nearly every U.S. state, especially targeting underserved markets and suburban locations. Unlike many other retailers, Ross has historically maintained a limited online presence. Instead, the company focused on driving foot traffic to physical stores, which offer constantly rotating inventory and a \"treasure hunt\"-like shopping experience. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, which temporarily shut down many of its stores, Ross bolstered its digital presence to complement its core in-store experience. In the early 2000s, the company operated around 700 stores. Today, it has over 2,100 Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS locations across the United States. Founded in 1981 in Louisiana and later incorporated in 1993, Pool has steadily grown into\u00a0one of the world\u2019s largest wholesale distributors of swimming pool supplies, equipment, and outdoor leisure products, serving both commercial and residential markets. Its product portfolio includes essential pool maintenance items such as chemicals and replacement parts, as well as packaged pool kits and landscaping products. The company also sells irrigation systems, outdoor lighting, grills, and outdoor kitchen components, along with golf course irrigation and water management products. POOL went public in 1995 and expanded rapidly. Since then, it's executed an aggressive acquisition strategy, which has played a significant role in its growth, both domestically and internationally. Major acquisitions of several European distributors, and Horizon Distributors have broadened its markets into irrigation and lawn management. Pool now operates over 440 sales centers worldwide. Over the past decade, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Pool benefited from a surge in home improvement spending, as more homeowners stuck at home invested in pools, spas, and outdoor living projects. That said, the pool business is notoriously seasonal, with demand depending on weather patterns, regional climates, and the wider economic landscape. This can create challenges in managing inventory and staffing levels. Founded in 1978, Biogen has been a key player in the biotechnology sector for decades, particularly with its focus on neurological diseases. Early on, Biogen established itself as a major developer of multiple sclerosis (MS) therapies with the launch of Avonex in 1996, one of the first treatments for relapsing-remitting MS. Over the years, Biogen continued to enhance its MS portfolio with the introduction of other breakthrough therapies like Tysabri (2004) and Tecfidera (2013), which have been crucial in helping patients manage this chronic disease. Tecfidera, in particular, became a blockbuster drug and cemented Biogen\u2019s sway in the MS market. The past two decades have seen significant shifts in its strategic direction, marked by triumphs and very public challenges. Biogen gained significant momentum in the 1990s by launching its first major product, Avonex, for multiple sclerosis. It then had success with the launches of Tysabri and Tecfidera. These drugs generated significant revenue and established Biogen as a major player in neurology care\u2014but those revenues were innately finite and due to run out once generics and other treatments were later allowed to be sold. In the mid-2000s, Biogen expanded its neurology portfolio with Spinraza, a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. This marked a successful foray into rare diseases and demonstrated its ability to develop therapies for complex neurological conditions. Biogen also entered the biosimilar market, offering more affordable versions of existing biological drugs. At the same time, BIIB's revenue stream had been facing increasing pressure due to patent expirations and competition from generics and biosimilars. This is why Biogen has been actively pursuing diversification strategies to cut its reliance on the MS franchise and find new avenues for growth. This leads us to its Alzheimer's disease research, premised on a controversial amyloid-beta targeting approach (the belief that certain plaques in the brain are among the causes of the disease). The company developed Aduhelm from this research, which received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021 but sparked significant controversy over its efficacy and exorbitant price tag. Biogen's accelerated approval of Aduhelm and subsequent pushback from the medical community, payers (insurers and customers), and even the FDA cast a shadow on Biogen's Alzheimer's strategy and raised concerns about its clinical trial data and marketing practices. In 2024, it abandoned the drug. Meanwhile, Biogen has been seeking new growth drivers, including expanding its biosimilars portfolio, advancing its pipeline in areas like neuropsychiatry and immunology, and looking at acquisitions that fit its strategies. In 2023, Biogen received traditional approval for Leqembi (lecanemab), an Alzheimer's drug said to have more robust clinical data than Aduhelm. Netflix has dramatically transformed how the world consumes entertainment over the past two decades. From its niche beginnings as a DVD-by-mail service, it has evolved into a global streaming behemoth, shifting the television and film industries. Netflix has said that it plans to stop releasing its streaming numbers in 2025, which could leave investors and consumers in the dark about the relative popularity of Netflix itself and its offerings. Founded in 1997, Netflix has transformed from a mail-order DVD rental business into a global powerhouse in the streaming industry. Initially, the company upended the retail video rental market with its subscription-based DVD delivery model. In 2007, it shifted the entertainment landscape again by launching its streaming service, quickly expanding internationally. Within six years, Netflix was making its first forays into producing original content with the release of House of Cards, signaling its ambitions to become more than just a distributor of others' work. The company\u2019s investment in original programming quickly and dramatically expanded, leading to popular series such as Stranger Things and The Crown and award-winning films like Roma. Today, Netflix streams in over 190 countries, offering a vast library of licensed and original content to its 270 million global subscribers. Over the last two decades, Apple has cemented itself as one of the world\u2019s most influential technology companies. Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, Apple was initially known for its personal computers. However, it was the early 2000s that marked the beginning of Apple's most transformative era. The launch of the iTunes Store in early 2001, followed by the iPod months later, upended a music industry that was already changing to digital offerings, positioning Apple as a leader in consumer electronics and digital media. The company operates through five geographical segments: the Americas, Europe (including India, the Middle East, and Africa), Greater China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. Apple may have made its name as an early purveyor of personal computers, but it's long since become a smartphone company. In 2023, iPhone net sales were just over half of its revenues, while its computer business was less than 8%. Apple has undergone a remarkable transformation over the last three decades, evolving from a computer manufacturer adored by a relative few to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. Its ascent during this time has produced no shortage of books studying how the company did it. In the early 2000s, Apple introduced products like the iPod and the iTunes Store, which shifted how the music industry, then under a grave threat from digital piracy, sold much of its content. However, the real turning point came in 2007 with the launch of the iPhone, a product that redefined smartphones and became the cornerstone of Apple\u2019s growth. Apple has continued to produce new products\u2014its launches, streamed live, are widely covered as almost cultural events\u2014that include the iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods while enhancing its software and services ecosystem through the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and more. Under the leadership of Steve Jobs and, later, Tim Cook, the company has focused on integrating hardware, software, and services, creating a continuous experience for users. Financially, Apple's growth has been staggering. Its stock has experienced substantial appreciation, especially after its stock splits in 2014 and 2020, which made it more accessible to retail investors. The company reached a historic milestone in August 2020, becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to surpass a $2 trillion market capitalization. Apple\u2019s business model has shifted in recent years toward a greater emphasis on services, which now represent a significant portion of its revenue. This has helped it move away from its dependence on hardware sales. NVR has quietly become one of the most successful homebuilders in the U.S. Unlike many of its competitors, NVR has focused on financial stability and controlled growth, leading to impressive returns for its shareholders. The company operates across the four major regions up and down the U.S.'s eastern seaboard. Founded in 1980 and based in Virginia, NVR is known for its disciplined, risk-averse approach to land acquisition and very efficient operation. NVR doesn't develop on its land but is \"land light,\" contracting to buy finished lots from land developers. This has helped minimize the kind of financial exposure that has rocked its competitors when real estate prices have dropped. While the value of shares in real estate investment trusts and other property-related stocks took a hit in the early 2020s as the sector weathered the pandemic and post-pandemic economies and rising interest rates, NVR maintained its consistent returns overall. In the early 2000s, NVR experienced significant growth, benefiting from the housing boom that preceded the 2008 financial crisis. However, the company navigated the housing market downturn better than many of its competitors because of its conservative approach to landowning. Throughout the 2010s and into the 2020s, NVR consistently grew in revenue and earnings as demand for housing increased and interest rates were low, particularly in suburban and exurban areas. Through its well-established Ryan Homes and NVHomes brands, along with its periodic stock repurchases, NVR has built a reputation for consistently delivering impressive financial performance, solidifying its leadership in the homebuilding industry. Monster has grown exponentially over the past two decades, transforming from a small natural beverage company into a global energy drink giant. This success story is fueled by aggressive marketing, strategic partnerships, and a keen understanding of its target market. The company operates through four key segments: Monster energy drinks, which focuses on ready-to-drink energy beverages distributed through bottlers and distributors; strategic brands,which handles the sale of concentrates and beverage bases to bottling operations; alcohol brands, which handles a selection of craft beers, hard seltzers, and flavored malt beverages (FMBs); and the Other segment, which includes sales by subsidiary American Fruits and Flavors LLC to independent customers. A Depression-era natural soft drink, Monster's transformation into a global energy drink powerhouse began in 2002 with the introduction of the now-iconic Monster Energy drink marked quite a shift for the firm and the wider industry. Riding the wave of rising consumer demand for energy drinks, Monster's aggressive marketing tactics\u2014focusing on extreme sports, music, and youth culture\u2014helped it carve out a significant market share in the highly competitive beverage market. By appealing to a younger demographic with a unique brand image, Monster quickly became a significant competitor to Red Bull, the long-time leader in the energy drink space. The company has extended its energy drink portfolio with new flavors and product lines, including Monster Rehab, Monster Ultra, and Monster Java, each focused on reaching consumers not always likely to grab fluorescent-colored beverages off the shelf of local convenience stores. In 2015, Monster entered into its most important distribution partnership with the Coca-Cola Company (KO), which took a minority stake in the company. This deal not only provided Monster with Coca-Cola\u2019s global distribution network but also allowed Monster to focus on its core energy drink business since Coca-Cola assumed responsibility for the non-energy drink segment of its portfolio. This partnership has been instrumental in Monster's international expansion and has significantly contributed to its growing market share worldwide. Monster has lived up to its name in the investment space. Investopedia noted in 2023 that in the previous 25 years, the company's returns had soundly beaten all comers among those listed on the S&P 500 index. That includes Apple, Amazon, and other tech darlings. Not all has been smooth sailing. The energy drink industry has long faced scrutiny regarding health concerns and potential regulation. Monster also has intense competition for consumer and shelf space from established players like Red Bull and emerging brands in the energy drink market. Meanwhile, Monster has pursued strategic acquisitions and partnerships to enlarge its product offerings and distribution network. In 2022, it acquired CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective LLC. The result was that Monster soon came out with its first alcoholic beverage, the Monster Beast Unleashed, as part of its continuous push into other beverage categories. This includes another partnership with Coca-Cola, formed in early 2024, to develop and commercialize a line of non-alcoholic ready-to-drink tea and coffee beverages. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has transformed from a pioneering online bookstore into one of the world\u2019s largest and most influential companies. In the early 2000s, Amazon was primarily known for selling books, music, and DVDs online. Still, its expansion strategy, premised on bringing to other goods the same success and at-home delivery as its first products, has driven its meteoric rise to become a dominant force in ecommerce, cloud computing, logistics, entertainment, and more. Its North American and International segments focus on the retail sale of consumer products and subscriptions via region-specific websites. At the same time, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a suite of cloud computing services for startups, enterprises, governments, and academic institutions. Amazon\u2019s growth was initially fueled by its expanding product catalog and its focus on building a vast, efficient logistics network to support fast delivery. The launch of Amazon Prime in 2005 was a key milestone for the company, offering customers unlimited two-day shipping for an annual fee, further strengthening customer loyalty. Beyond retail, one of the most significant developments for Amazon came with the introduction of AWS in 2006. AWS quickly grew into the world\u2019s leading cloud computing platform, providing infrastructure, storage, and computing power to businesses and governments globally. Unknown to most in the public who know the Amazon brand, AWS has been a key driver of Amazon\u2019s profitability and has become a critical growth engine for the company, consistently contributing a substantial portion of its operating income. Amazon controls about a third of the cloud market worldwide, far more than its competitors, Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Azure and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (GOOGL) Google Cloud. Amazon\u2019s acquisition strategy has also been instrumental in its growth. Major purchases, including Whole Foods in 2017, allowed Amazon to expand its fledgling grocery business, while its acquisition of Twitch in 2014 strengthened its foothold in the live-streaming and gaming industries. In addition, Amazon Studios and its Prime Video streaming service have become key players in the entertainment space, producing original content and competing with giants like Netflix and Disney. Amazon's stock performance has mirrored its business success, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. In 2018, Amazon joined the elite group of companies with a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion, reflecting investor confidence in its diversified business model and long-term prospects. Founded in 1993, NVIDIA designs and manufactures graphics processors, chipsets, and multimedia software. The company operates through several key segments: graphics processing units (GPUs), Tegra processors, and others. Its GPU segment produces the needed chips for significant markets. Its offerings include GeForce brand for gamers, Quadro for designers, and Tesla and DGX systems for AI researchers. The Tegra processor segment integrates GPUs with multi-core CPUs for autonomous machines, gaming consoles, and mobile devices. Initially focused on creating advanced graphics for gaming, NVIDIA helped develop ever newer generations of GPUs, releasing the GeForce 256 in 1999, often cited as the first modern GPU. This invention produced a leap forward for both the gaming and professional graphics industries, enabling faster and more efficient rendering. Nvidia's GPU architecture would later extend to other fields such as AI, deep learning, and autonomous vehicles, solidifying the company\u2019s influence beyond just gaming. When NVIDIA introduced the Geforce 256 in 1999, it was the first widely available GPU. Over the last three decades, Nvidia has diversified its portfolio. The company\u2019s GPUs are now essential in data centers, powering AI applications and machine learning tasks. NVIDIA's role in cloud computing, professional visualization, and the automotive sector has driven extraordinary revenue growth, with its GPUs used in complex simulations, content creation, and cryptocurrency mining. The acquisition of Mellanox Technologies in 2020 increased Nvidia's data center capabilities, adding networking technology to its offerings. Nvidia\u2019s stock had substantial growth in 2023 and 2024, propelled by the demand for AI chips and increased revenue from its data center business. With a significant expansion of partnerships in recent years in cloud computing and AI applications like OpenAI ChatGPT, NVIDIA has cemented the company\u2019s leading role across multiple high-growth sectors. Novice investors should focus on stable, well-established stocks with long-term growth potential. Blue-chip stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are known for their reliability and consistent returns. In addition, mutual and exchange-traded funds that track market indexes, such as the S&P 500 ETF (SPY), provide diversified market exposure, reducing risk while capturing broad market performance. There are also long-standing dividend-paying stocks like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Coca-Cola, which offer a steady income stream that appeals to those seeking a combination of growth and income. As of October 2024, the top-performing stocks year-to-date include Vistra Corporation (VST), NVIDIA, and Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG), delivering impressive returns of 242%, 165%, and 143%, respectively. From September 1994 to September 2024, the S&P 500 Index achieved an average monthly rate of return of 0.70%, translating into an annualized return of 8.4%. The top-performing stocks over the past 30 years offer a surprising insight: not all the leaders come from the technology sector. While tech giants like NVIDIA and Apple have undeniably driven strong returns, non-tech companies such as Ross Stores, Pool, and Monster have also delivered impressive growth. This highlights the importance of diversification and demonstrates the opportunities in many different sectors, including retail, consumer goods, and distribution. These industries are often overlooked by investors who myopically focus on media-friendly tech stocks. Nevertheless, diversifying across sectors is critical to capturing long-term growth in the market.

            "title": "Is Investing in Meme Stocks a Good Idea?",
            "content": "Understanding the Risks and Rewards of This Investment Trend Adam Hayes, Ph.D., CFA, is a financial writer with 15+ years Wall Street experience as a derivatives trader. Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master's in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology. He is a CFA charterholder as well as holding FINRA Series 7, 55 & 63 licenses. He currently researches and teaches economic sociology and the social studies of finance at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. In recent years, Wall Street has seen the meteoric rise of \"meme stocks\"\u2014securities that gain rapid popularity and trading volume because of their viral nature on social media and online forums. From GameStop (GME) to AMC Entertainment (AMC), these volatile stocks have captured the attention of retail investors and financial markets alike. But what exactly are meme stocks, and is investing in them a wise financial move? The term \"meme stock\" is a relatively new addition to the investment lexicon, emerging in the wake of the GameStop trading frenzy of early 2021. However, the concept of stocks spiking suddenly in popularity and trading volume from social media buzz and online investor communities has been around for longer. The meme stock phenomena can be traced to the rise of commission-free trading platforms like Robinhood (HOOD) and the growing influence of online forums such as Reddit's r/WallStreetBets. In 2021, as many were at home due to pandemic-era lockdowns, the time and free trading available set the table for what followed. In the past, stocks like Tesla (TSLA) or crypto assets like Bitcoin have exhibited meme-like characteristics, with their prices often swayed by social media sentiment and online discussions. However, the GameStop saga of early 2021 brought the concept of meme stocks into the mainstream. In January 2021, the stock of GameStop, a struggling brick-and-mortar video game retailer, surged to a peak of several hundred dollars per share in a matter of days. This unprecedented spike was primarily driven by activity on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, where retail investors banded together to buy the stock en masse and squeeze short-sellers who had bet against the company. However, regulators later examined various trading platforms, concerned they had boosted trading during the craze. The GameStop phenomenon highlighted several key characteristics that have come to define meme stocks: Since the GameStop event, other stocks like AMC Entertainment, BlackBerry, and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), among others, have also been caught up in the meme stock frenzy. The phenomenon has drawn attention to the growing influence of retail investors and the power of social media in shaping financial markets. However, it is important to note that while meme stocks offer the potential for rapid gains, these are generally, as later investigations made clear, far outweighed by the risks to most investors. The speculative nature of these investments, combined with high volatility and the potential for market manipulation, makes them unsuitable for anyone but traders with knowledge about what's happening in the moment and experience to act on it. Meme stocks arose from a unique investment subculture characterized by a strong sense of community, solidarity, and a shared identity among retail investors. This culture is primarily fostered through online forums, social media platforms, and messaging apps, where investors gather to discuss stocks, share research and opinions, and coordinate their investment strategies. At the heart of this community is a sense of camaraderie and a desire to level the playing field against institutional investors and traditional Wall Street firms. These retail investors see themselves as underdogs taking on the financial establishment. Many share the goal of driving up the prices of meme stocks, causing losses for hedge funds that have shorted these stocks and profiting from the ensuing volatility. The language and humor used within these communities are often irreverent, self-deprecating, and filled with inside jokes and memes. Members use a mix of financial jargon and internet slang, with terms like diamond hands (holding a stock despite market fluctuations), \"tendies\" (profits), and \"to the moon\" (expecting a stock price to rise significantly) becoming part of the everyday lexicon. These communities have also developed a strong sense of loyalty and mutual support. Members often encourage each other to hold their positions, even during market downturns or negative news. HODL (a misspelling of hold) has become a rallying cry, urging members to maintain their convictions in the face of adversity. The sense of community and shared purpose among meme stock investors has also led to a blurring between investing and social activism. In some cases, investors have framed their actions as a form of protest against the perceived inequalities and corruption of the financial system. The GameStop saga, for example, was seen by many as a way to punish hedge funds for their predatory short-selling practices. It's worth highlighting that central to the meme stock phenomenon is a mix of populism, defiance of elites, ironic detachment, and sheer entertainment value\u2014that is, trolling. Investors taking part might buy specific stocks not only for potential gains but also to challenge traditional market norms, spite short-sellers, or simply for the entertaining narrative surrounding the stock. For example, in the case of BlackBerry, some investors may have been drawn to the stock as an ironic way to support a company that had become largely irrelevant in the smartphone market. Despite BlackBerry's steep decline since its Obama-era popularity, retail investors rallied around the stock, partly because of the supposed comedic value of investing in a company whose devices were considered outdated relics. This troll-like behavior adds even more unpredictability to the meme stock phenomenon. A New York Times cultural piece during the height of trading in GameStop offered a perceptive take on the thinking of many Redditors combining to drive up meme stocks: \"Professionals have been manipulating markets for years. Now it\u2019s our turn.\u00a0This doubles as a challenge to the finance world:\u00a0Tell us how this is different.\" Not everyone is amused. Critics argue that the meme stock culture promotes groupthink and a herd mentality, leading to a disregard for fundamental analysis and a focus on short-term gains over long-term value. The echo chamber of these online communities often amplifies confirmation bias and leads to the spread of misinformation or conspiracy theories. Despite these concerns, meme stock investors' sense of community and shared identity remains a powerful force. As social media continues to shape how people interact and share information, this culture will likely evolve while influencing the world of investing\u2014creating exceptional risks for investors willing to engage. While meme stocks offer the potential for sudden, significant gains, they also come with significant risks. The rapid influx of investment and sudden price surges are often followed by equally swift declines, leading to large losses if you bought on the way up. In addition, the viral nature of meme stocks makes them susceptible to market manipulation, as coordinated buying or selling efforts can artificially inflate or deflate prices. Indeed, there have been enforcement actions brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after various meme stock events. For example, GameStop underwent new periods of volatility in 2024, driven in part by the actions of influential figures within the meme stock community. In June 2024, Keith Gill, also known as \"Roaring Kitty\" on Reddit, posted a series of memes on social media along with a screenshot of his GameStop position, revealing a large bullish position. Gill, who became a celebrity among GameStop investors during the first meme stock frenzy in January 2021, saw his post go viral with millions of views. Following Gill's post, GameStop's stock price surged by nearly 50% within a day as retail investors rushed to buy shares and ride a new wave of enthusiasm. This raises questions about the potential for market manipulation within the meme stock community. While Gill's post may have genuinely reflected his belief in GameStop's prospects, the outsized impact of his social media activity on the stock price highlights the power that influential figures can wield in this space. The SEC's staff report on meme stocks concluded with pretty forceful prose it's not usually known for. \"Underneath the memes are actual companies, with employees, customers, and plans to invest in the future. Those who bought GameStop became co-owners of a company through a system of mutual trust and participation that sustains our economy,\" Having reminded readers of the stakes for those impacted by the trading, the writers pulled back to make a crucial broader point. \"People may disagree about the prospects of GameStop and the other meme stocks, but those disagreements are what should lead to price discovery rather than disruptions.\" A striking disconnect between the share price and company fundamentals often defines meme stocks. This means the company's financial performance, growth prospects, or market position do not justify the stock price. Instead, the price is driven by hype, collective enthusiasm, and speculation\u2014not a careful assessment of the company's intrinsic value. This disconnect makes meme stocks inherently risky for long-term investment decisions. When the price of a stock is not tethered to the company's fundamentals, it becomes considerably more challenging to predict future performance and to make informed decisions about when to buy, hold, or sell. Essentially, it's far closer to gambling than investing. Then, as is almost always the case, when market prices eventually fall in line with long-term fundamentals, investors who bought at the peak may face significant losses. The flurry of trading surrounding meme stocks has drawn the attention of regulators and lawmakers. The SEC still has concerns over potential market manipulation and the need for increased oversight given the meme stock phenomenon. In some cases, trading platforms have restricted or halted trading in meme stocks to manage risk and follow regulations. In others, social media influencers, such as Roaring Kitty, have been investigated for being on the wrong side of securities laws. In a twist of irony, GameStop\u2014a company known for selling video games\u2014became the centerpiece of a phenomenon that highlighted concerns about the gamification of investing itself. The GameStop saga, while driven by social media, was also fueled by trading on gamified trading platforms that could amplify market trends, turning stock trading into a viral, gamelike experience that spread rapidly through social media. As was reported in 2023, the SEC has stepped up efforts to better regulate the market. In recent years, across various sectors, app makers and management companies have been incorporating \"gamification\" or \"digital engagement practices\" (points, rewards, and gamelike features) into employee training and more. Many trading apps now include social features that allow users to share trades or follow other investors, mirroring the community-driven nature of the meme stock movement on platforms like Reddit. In the abstract, some researchers point out how \"gamification\" can be used, with behavioral finance principles, to nudge investors toward better behaviors. But investors aren't speculating using apps in the abstract; they are investing through broker platforms whose gamification nudges are for increased trades, not to push retail investors toward the best long-term trades\u2014which, by definition, would lead to a decrease in trading, not more. Gamified features like push notifications about price movements or popular trades can trigger FOMO, potentially driving investors to make impulsive decisions, as seen during the meme stock boom. While these platforms have made investing more accessible, the meme stock event highlighted how this accessibility, combined with gamelike features, could lead to heightened volatility and risk-taking among inexperienced investors. \"My primary concern with gamification is its potential to induce trading that is more frequent or higher-risk than an investor would choose\" otherwise, said Rick Fleming, the SEC's former investor advocate. For Fleming, gamification muddied the distinctions that SEC regulations, including Regulation Best Interest (BI), 2020, take as clear, namely the difference between solicited (recommended by brokers) and unsolicited (initiated by the client) trades. For solicited trades, brokers are typically required to ensure the recommendation suits the customer. During much of the meme stock period of the early 2020s, the requirement was less stringent for unsolicited trades: unsolicited trades were to be \"suitable,\" not in the clients' \"best interest.\" \"Brokers' obligations under Reg BI should not turn on whether the customer technically initiates the trades after the broker has used subtle techniques to influence the customer to engage in active trading, trade on margin, trade options, and engage in other risky practices,\" he said. This is why, as we reported in 2023, the SEC amended regulation BI to ensure it covered the predictive algorithms behind gamified investment apps. The meme stock phenomenon brought these regulatory challenges into sharp focus. Features like confetti animations for completed trades, prominent during the GameStop frenzy, brought home worries that such design elements induced too much risky investor behavior. The biologist Richard Dawkins is credited with creating the term in his 1976 book, \"The Selfish Gene.\" There, in the midst of a book-long argument on the need to treat evolution at the genetic, not species or individual level, he used the term to refer to how cultural ideas, akin to the genetic formations he was examining, reproduce throughout a culture. Whatever the value of treating our deepest cultural ideas like \"selfish\" genes just reproducing themselves to live on, the word is now used, perhaps appropriately, for the most ephemeral and superficial of social media phenomena. Given meme stocks' viral and nonfundamental nature, it is crucial to conduct thorough research and due diligence before investing. This includes examining the company's financial health, competitive landscape, and growth prospects, as well as understanding technical analysis. While social media buzz can be tempting, basing investment decisions only on online hype is not a wise approach to trading. If you still want to get involved in the meme stock craze, monitor your positions closely and in real-time. Set take-profit and stop-limit orders, knowing that any upside potential may be short-lived. Determine how much you'll invest and can afford to lose, and stick to those boundaries. It's also wise to have a defined exit strategy to manage risk and protect profits, such as setting price targets or stop-loss orders. Meanwhile, a short-term meme stock strategy should fit your overall market strategy. In this case, it should suit only those with a high-risk tolerance. You'll want to ensure you don't exceed your specified allocation to meme stocks; holding several meme stocks is not diversification since their prices tend to be highly correlated. The top meme stocks have been GameStop, AMC Entertainment, Bed, Bath, & Beyond (BBBY), BlackBerry, and Nokia (NOK). Other stocks that have been caught in \"meme\" bubbles for one reason or another also include Tupperware (TUP), Tesla (TSLA), Robinood (HOOD), and Coinbase (COIN). Yes, meme stocks represent the shares of actual corporations\u2014although their fundamentals may not always be so healthy. Trading in meme stocks is perfectly aboveboard, so long as there is no market manipulation, insider trading, or fraud. In general, retirement saving should consist of a broadly diversified portfolio with a mix of different assets. Putting a small amount of retirement money into meme stocks can be okay (a very low, single-digit percentage of your assets), if you are willing to take the potential losses and have a long enough time horizon to handle the volatility. However, since meme stock prices are often disconnected from their fundamentals, they are not generally a good long-term investment. No. In 2021, the ETF company Roundhill debuted a meme stock exchange-traded fund under the ticker symbol MEME, but it was shut down two years later in 2023 after huge losses and waning interest from investors. Trading meme stocks is akin to riding roller coasters for adrenaline-junkie investors, but like intense theme park rides, they're not recommended for those without the stomach or financial means to engage in such trading. The attraction of quick profits and the sense of community surrounding these stocks can be enticing, but the inherent volatility, lack of fundamentals, and potential for manipulation make them quite risky. For investors with a high-risk tolerance, capital to spare, and a willingness to closely monitor the market, meme stocks could offer prospects for short-term gains and excitement. However, this approach requires a keen understanding of market dynamics, the ability to time entries and exits accurately, and a willingness to accept the potential for significant losses. For most investors, particularly those with longer-term goals like saving for retirement or building wealth over time, meme stocks are not a wise choice.

            "content": "Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Jacob Wackerhausen / Getty Images A quarterly earnings release is a document that summarizes and highlights a company's earnings and other financial information for a three-month period. Quarterly earnings releases generally also provide a brief analysis from executives and may include financial statements or other information deemed important to shareholders. Some companies include an outlook for the rest of the year and graphics to help analysts get the information they are looking for. Stock analysts and investors use these releases with other data and information to gauge the financial health of a company and its prospects for the future. Quarterly earnings releases provide an earnings update to shareholders in a format that somewhat simplifies and better explains the information from the Form 10-Q sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The 10-Q is more comprehensive in nature than the quarterly earnings report and provides additional details. The quarterly earnings release is usually published before the 10-Q. Companies are not required to issue these reports, but most publish them as press releases to ensure their shareholders are informed as early as possible. The term \"quarterly earnings report\" is often used to refer to the quarterly earnings release, but the report and release are different. The report is the Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, while the earnings release is the non-required financial summary published by companies for shareholders, analysts, and prospective investors. Quarterly earnings releases generally begin with a discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition for the period from management. These discussions tend to announce revenue and net income compared to previous periods, any important actions taken or planned, and earnings per share. Some include financial ratios and metrics used by analysts, while others may limit their releases to only reporting earnings and earnings per share. Many companies present information using graphics and charts and include ratios often used by analysts, but since these releases are not a requirement, they are free to present the information any way they choose. For example, Ameren Corporation's earnings release for the second quarter of 2024 was brief and simple, while JP Morgan & Chase's format was elaborate, presenting much more information on the first page: These periodic releases might also include the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash flow statement. These statements provide an organized overview of sales, expenses, net income, assets, liabilities, shareholders' equity, and cash flow for the most recent quarter. The announcement of quarterly earnings for a stock, particularly for widely followed large capitalization stocks, can move the overall market. An individual stock's price can also fluctuate wildly on days when the company's quarterly earnings release is published. For better or worse, a company's ability to beat earnings estimates projected by analysts or by the firm itself can be more important than its ability to grow earnings over the prior year. If it fails to meet or exceed the estimates published in previous releases, investors may begin to lose confidence in the company. In capital markets, it is all about market expectations since many believe expectations are already reflected in stock prices, following the efficient markets theory. Generally, earnings seasons start one or two weeks after the last month of a calendar quarter. Companies that use non-calendar fiscal years will publish earnings releases one or two weeks after their fiscal quarters end. You should be able to obtain the exact date and time for the quarterly earnings release announcement from the company's investor relations webpage. An earnings release is a non-required quarterly earnings summary a company publishes to inform analysts and shareholders about its quarterly earnings. Companies usually publish earnings releases on the investor relations section of their websites. Quarterly earnings releases are published by public companies every three months to provide data on their latest performance. Earnings releases are important to stock analysts, investors, and others as a way of assessing a company's current financial health and its performance over time. A disappointing earnings release can have serious consequences for the company's share price and, sometimes, for the entire market."

He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Political risk is the risk an investment's returns could suffer as a result of political changes or instability in a country. Instability affecting investment returns could stem from a change in government, legislative bodies, other foreign policymakers or military control. Political risk is also known as \"geopolitical risk,\" and becomes more of a factor as the time horizon of investment gets longer. They are considered a type of jurisdiction risk. Political risks are notoriously hard to quantify because there are limited sample sizes or case studies when discussing an individual nation. Some political risks can be insured against through international agencies or other government bodies. The outcome of political risk could drag down investment returns or even go so far as to remove the ability to withdraw capital from an investment. Aside from business factors arising from the marketplace, businesses are also impacted by political decisions. There are a variety of decisions governments make that can affect individual businesses, industries, and the overall economy. These include taxes, spending, regulation, currency valuation, trade tariffs, labor laws such as the minimum wage, and environmental regulations. The laws, even if just proposed, can have an impact. Regulations can be set at all levels of government, including federal, state and local, as well as in other countries. Some of the political risks may be found in a company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or a prospectus if it is a mutual fund. Companies that operate internationally, known as multinational businesses, can purchase political risk insurance to remove or mitigate certain political risks. This allows management and investors to concentrate on the business fundamentals while knowing losses from political risks are avoided or limited. Typical actions covered include war and terrorism. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. outlined certain political risks it faces in its fiscal 2015 10-K filing with the SEC under its operating risk section. In its risks associated with suppliers, Wal-Mart mentioned potential political and economic instability in the countries that foreign suppliers operate, labor problems, and foreign trade policies and tariffs that could be imposed. In its regulatory, compliance, reputational and other risks section, the company outlines risk associated with legislative, judicial, regulatory and political/economic risks. Risk factors mentioned include political instability, legal and regulatory constraints, local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, trade policies, and currency regulations. Wal-Mart mentioned Brazil specifically, and the complexity of its federal, state and local laws."

            "content": "Justin Sullivan\u00a0/\u00a0Getty Images The S&P 500\u2014the Standard & Poor's 500 Index\u2014is considered to be one of the best measures of U.S. stock market performance, tracking 500 of the largest and most stable publicly traded companies in the country. The top 25 stocks in the S&P 500 by weight represent the largest, most influential companies in the index. The index is weighted by market capitalization, giving more significance to companies with larger market values. As of Oct. 25, 2024, the S&P 500 (SPY) had increased in value by 19.6% since the beginning of the year. As the Fed is said to be considering further rate cuts after its September cut, the index hit a new high in mid-October. It has sold off a bit since then, but the two stocks that always appear on the most actively traded list continued higher. Nvidia (NVDA) is up by 64.50% this year as strong demand persists for the company's semiconductor AI chips. Tesla (TSLA) continued higher after an Oct. 23 conference call from founder Elon Musk. The electric vehicle manufacturer is now up 10.7% for the year after recovering from a sell-off earlier in the year. The stocks with some of the largest market capitalizations in the S&P 500 remain higher for the year. Amazon (AMZN) is up 22%. Alphabet (GOOGL) is up 18%. Meta Platforms (META) is up 38.9%. Apple (AAPL) is up 22%, and Walmart (WMT) is up 36.6%. To be included in the S&P 500, a company must: The S&P 500 reconstitutes each June. Companies removed from the index are not replaced until the next annual reconstitution. The table below lists the S&P 500's top sectors by weighting as of Oct. 25, 2024. The information technology, financials, healthcare, and consumer discretionary sectors carry a cumulative weight of about 67.4%. Meanwhile, the least-weighted sectors include energy, utilities, and real estate\u2014which have a combined weight of just 8.3%. These are the top 25 companies by index weight. Since the S&P Global website fails to disclose the weighting of component stocks, we used the S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (ETF), the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), in order to cite index weighting. The ETF's holdings are a bit different, but SPY closely reflects the S&P weights. As of Oct. 25, 2024, here are the largest SPY holdings by weight: Analyzing the top 25 stocks of the S&P 500 by index weight sheds light on the health of the stock market and broader economy. Since these companies make up a significant part of the index, they reflect the performance of key sectors, major companies, and the benchmark itself. Several factors have played a role in the outsized performance of tech names\u2014a resilient GDP, combined with declining inflation, strong margins, and competitive positions leading to cash flow generation, emerging trends such as AI, and safety in the face of an economic downturn given their size. There are several options when considering an investment in the S&P 500, spanning a wide range of risk tolerances and investment styles. ETFs\u2014like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)\u2014are popular due to their low costs and ease of trading, behaving like stocks on the exchange. For a more traditional approach, index funds, such as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFIAX) and Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX), offer a way to invest in the S&P 500, though they are traded only once per day at the market's close. For those interested in more complex strategies, derivatives like options and futures, including E-mini S&P 500 Futures, allow speculation on the future value of the index. Investing in the S&P 500 Index offers key advantages, such as exposure to 500 of the largest U.S. companies, providing a diversified portfolio in a single investment. This diversity typically reduces risk compared to investing in individual stocks. Additionally, the historical performance of the S&P 500 has shown consistent long-term growth, making it a favored choice for investorswith a long-term horizon who can wait out market volatility. However, a notable disadvantage is its heavy concentration in the top names, which could skew performance toward certain sectors or companies, potentially increasing risk. For example, the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index\u2014a version of the S&P 500 index where each of the constituent companies has an equal weight, regardless of their market capitalization\u2014is up 9.92% over the past year compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 19.23%. That said, as analysts have begun to lift their S&P 500 forecast based on upbeat profit revisions, the performance differential between the S&P 500 and its equal-weight counterpart should continue to narrow. The S&P 500 weights constituent companies by market cap, meaning larger firms carry significantly more weight than those with small market values. As a result, tech giants, such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon, greatly influence the index's performance. Investors closely follow the S&P 500's top 25 stocks by index weighting to gauge the health of the stock market and the broader U.S. economy.

In entertainment and media, streaming services use AI to recommend personalized content. For education, AI may be used to customize learning experiences for each student. In cybersecurity, AI systems may be used to detect and respond to cybersecurity threats. Indeed, AI is used to monitor transactions for patterns indicative of fraudulent activity. The potential for AI is vast, yet it brings ethical considerations such as data privacy, bias in decision making, and the impact on employment. Its applications are diverse, reflecting the adaptability and AI-backed processes. However, balancing innovation with ethical considerations should be front and center in assessing its evolution. Here are just some of the factors that will help you assess the potential risks and rewards of investing in AI-related firms: Investing in AI stocks requires understanding the technical aspects of AI technologies and assessing the traditional financial metrics. It is important to keep up with the latest developments in the AI field, as the technology and market dynamics can change rapidly. There are a growing number of AI and AI-related stocks. Here are some of the most-discussed: These companies are noted for the significance of their advances, market position, and applications of AI technology in their fields. Their presence in the AI market is marked not only by their financial performance but also by how they have integrated AI for diverse industrial and business challenges. Investing in AI stocks, like any investment, involves certain risks and challenges to consider. Here are some of them: As with any investment, you should conduct thorough due diligence, stay informed about industry trends, and consider diversifying your investments to mitigate these risks. Investing in AI stocks requires a strategy that can handle the technology\u2019s dynamic and rapidly evolving nature. Here are some tips: Combining a thorough understanding of the AI industry with sound investment practices will position you to better capitalize on the investment prospects in this growing field. This is being debated among investors, analysts, and industry experts. Indications of a bubble include high valuations, a plethora of speculation, rapid investment growth, and extreme positive market sentiment (hype) that leads to irrational investment behavior. While signs suggest some elements of the AI industry could be overvalued, there are also strong fundamentals supporting the growth and sustainability of AI as a transformative technology. Investors should exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and consider long-term trends when investing in this sector. There are several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that offer exposure to a basket of stocks from companies involved in the development, research, and utilization of AI. These include Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ), iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (IRBO), and First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF (ROBT). While some AI or AI-related stocks may pay dividends, the sector as a whole is growth-focused, with many companies reinvesting profits to fuel further expansion and R&D. Investors interested in AI and seeking dividends might need to look at larger, more diversified technology companies or consider AI-focused ETFs that include dividend-paying stocks. Investing in AI stocks could bring significant growth, given the transformative influence of artificial intelligence across many industries. However, it\u2019s important to recognize the unique characteristics of this sector. AI stocks are marked by high-growth expectations and rapid technological advances, which can lead to inflated valuations and increased volatility. Many AI companies, particularly those in early development stages, prefer reinvestment in technology and market expansion over paying dividends, focusing more on long-term capital appreciation than immediate income generation. Additionally, the AI sector is influenced by factors such as regulatory changes, ethical considerations of AI technologies, and the competitive landscape. All of these can influence stock performance. If you\u2019re considering AI or AI-related stocks, you need to account for these dynamics. This includes conducting thorough research to understand the potential and risks associated with AI investments, diversifying across different companies and subsectors within AI to mitigate risk, and maintaining a long-term investment perspective to navigate the inherent volatility. Balancing these considerations with traditional investment analysis will help you make more informed decisions and potentially capitalize on the growth opportunities that AI presents.

Bloomberg\u00a0/\u00a0Contributor / Getty Images Semiconductors are materials that conduct electricity but only under certain conditions (hence the \"semi\"), making them an essential component in modern electronics. They are found in products from smartphones and laptops to cars and medical devices. Semiconductors include microprocessors, memory modules, and integrated circuits, among other components. Their importance lies in their ability to process and transmit information, making it a major industry in the global economy. Semiconductor companies are among the largest in the global stock markets, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), and Broadcom Inc. (AVGO). Semiconductors are critical in most modern electronics and are essential to technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things. A notoriously cyclical industry that faces vast shifts in demand, the industry is expected to grow tremendously by the early 2030s. For example, worried about the effects on national security and competitiveness of such shortages, the U.S., EU, and other areas have committed billions to expand regional semiconductor manufacturing. The U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 is the biggest at $39 billion in grants and a 25% investment tax credit (plus $13.2 billion in research and development). In a May 2024 report, the Semiconductor Industry Association predicted these and similar incentive programs in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, India, and elsewhere should help propel about $2.3 trillion in private sector investment in wafer fabrication from 2024-2032, with the U.S. seeing the largest increase in capacity, about 203%. After the pandemic, the semiconductor industry faced a prolonged chip shortage that disrupted supply chains and delayed manufacturing in autos and other sectors. Even as PC sales have slumped, overall demand for semiconductors of all stripes\u2014from basic microcontrollers and memory chips to the most sophisticated high-performance processors\u2014had outgrown producer capacity. By mid-2024, production and supply chain slowdowns were largely mitigated, though the effect would likely be felt for some time for some types of chips. Before the pandemic, the industry was already seeing demand outstrip supply because of the increasing demand from companies involved in AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced cellular networks, which require more powerful and efficient semiconductors. The pandemic also reshaped global demand as people shifted to remote work and online learning, exacerbating trends already underway. International trade in semiconductors increased 43% between 2017 and 2022. In addition to increased demand, the semiconductor industry has been an issue in geopolitical strife and trade tensions. For example, in recent years, the U.S. government has placed export restrictions on Chinese semiconductor companies, citing concerns about intellectual property theft and national security. The semiconductor industry itself, however, had record profits and record stock prices from 2020 through 2024 after a brief dip in 2022. The chart below depicts the VanEck Semiconductor Index ETF (SMH) prices from 2020 up to the second quarter of 2024. Chip stocks slumped in 2022 due to fears of a global recession. In addition, weaker consumer spending meant companies cut back on semiconductor products, even as chipmakers invested billions in new fabrication plants to increase supply. Then, in 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced strict export restrictions on selling semiconductors and equipment to China, which could cost up to billions of dollars in revenue over the next few years for several struggling semiconductor firms. The semiconductor sector, however, began recovering by mid-2023, reaching record highs in early 2024. This was due in no small part to the rise of NVIDIA, a leader in the growing GPU market for crypto mining and AI applications. NVIDIA is the largest holding for SMH at about 20%, with TSM at about 13% and Broadcom at 8%. The semiconductor industry's future is closely intertwined with the development of several key technologies, including AI, IoT, green energy, autonomous vehicles, and 5G+ networks. The increasing demand for faster, more efficient, and more powerful computing devices is driving the need for semiconductor materials, manufacturing processes, and chip architectures. A notable recent development is the return of germanium as a semiconductor material. Germanium was used in the first transistors but was largely replaced by silicon since the latter is abundant, costs less, and tests better for certain aspects of conductivity. However, germanium's higher electron and hole mobility could make it more efficient for future high-performance transistors. Researchers are exploring ways to integrate germanium channels into circuits, which could lead to faster and more energy-efficient devices. Advances in germanium-based transistors, such as FinFETs and nanowire designs, could help overcome some of the limitations of silicon as the industry approaches the physical limits of its current materials. In addition to the potential comeback of germanium, researchers have recently made a breakthrough in manufacturing highly purified silicon, which could be a boon for quantum computing. Using a focused beam of pure silicon-28 to replace the undesirable silicon-29 atoms in a chip, they have created a material that can sustain the delicate quantum coherence needed for reliable quantum calculations, bringing the realization of robust, scalable quantum computers one step closer. Scaling up production is critical for the semiconductor industry while maintaining quality and reliability. This could involve investing in new manufacturing technologies, such as extreme ultraviolet lithography, which enables the creation of smaller and more precise chip features. In addition, the development of sophisticated packaging techniques, such as 3D chip stacking and wafer-level packaging, can help improve chip density and performance. The $52 billion in funding from the CHIPS Act is expected to vastly increase the size of the U.S. semiconductor industry, tripling domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity by 2032. The EU will also see the fruits of its European Chips Act, and China initiated the third phase of its semiconductor funding. Incentive programs emerged or expanded in the first half of the 2020s in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and India. In parallel, companies have made significant investments in both established and new semiconductor manufacturing regions. These will also increase production across the world. Wafer fabrication is projected to become more durable by geographically diversifying, with leading-edge capacity expanding beyond Taiwan and South Korea to include the U.S., Europe, and Japan. In assembly, testing and packaging (ATP), China and Taiwan should continue to hold the largest share in global capacity. However, countries in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe are expected to expand ATP activity, helped along by government and investor support. The development of sophisticated packaging and new chiplet designs is also driving some ATP production growth in the U.S. and Europe near their new wafer fabs. However, the semiconductor industry also faces potential challenges. A major concern is the increasing cost and complexity of chip manufacturing, particularly as sizes continue to shrink. Developing new manufacturing processes and materials, such as germanium, requires billions in research and development. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and trade disputes, such as those between the U.S. and China, can cause bottlenecks in trading. Lingering tensions between the U.S. and China in the semiconductor space stem from U.S. efforts to curb China\u2019s technological advances, fearing potential military applications, while also aspiring to rejuvenate domestic chip manufacturing. In mid-2024, the largest semiconductor stocks by revenue (trailing 12 months) are as follows: Based in South Korea, Samsung has semiconductor revenues but is a diversified business. The others above have a very high percentage of their companies involved in semiconductors. Here are important exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the semiconductor sector: The largest semiconductor makers in the world are South Korea\u2019s Samsung, U.S.-based NVIDIA and Intel, and Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. The top five countries producing semiconductors are China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and the U.S. Investors often consider adding semiconductor stocks or ETFs to a diversified portfolio. The semiconductor industry is a crucial component of the technology sector and plays a significant role in powering many devices, including computers, smartphones, and other electronic devices. As technology continues to advance, demand for semiconductors is likely to grow, driving revenue and profits for semiconductor companies. A focus on innovation can lead to significant long-term growth potential for companies that are successful in developing new products. Despite recent challenges, the semiconductor industry is expected to grow over the long term, driven by continued demand for electronics and technological advances. The industry itself is highly innovative, and chips have become exponentially more efficient and powerful over the past decades. Since they are so ubiquitous, it seems that semiconductors will not be replaced anytime soon, although they will continue to improve. Additionally, the discovery and application of new materials like graphene (a novel form of carbon), the advent of quantum computing, and the use of photonic circuits may be used alongside traditional semiconductors. The semiconductor sector is a major part of the stock market. It's not just a major player by market capitalization, but is critical to many industries, such as automotive, healthcare, and telecommunications. Disruptions in the industry, such as after the pandemic, showed its importance across the economy. The performance of semiconductor stocks can impact the broader market, as seen in 2024, when the sector hit record highs, following a sluggish 2022 to 2023, when the sector experienced losses, contributing to a measurable drag on the overall market. As the chip market is expected to continue growing, investors should closely monitor the performance of the companies that make them.

            "content": "Food Insecurity Negatively Affects the Economy, and Therefore the Stock Market Adam Hayes, Ph.D., CFA, is a financial writer with 15+ years Wall Street experience as a derivatives trader. Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master's in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology.

Food insecurity is generally considered an economic and social issue, though not one that affects the stock market. Nevertheless, its ramifications involve the food, retail, and consumer goods sectors, and it can be a symptom of broader economic problems, including poverty, unemployment, and inflation. The struggle of households to put food on the table can also indirectly influence stock valuations and investment returns. In essence, the tendrils of food insecurity stretch into the core mechanisms of the stock market, affecting consumer behavior, corporate earnings, and even investor sentiment. Recognizing these connections reveals a more nuanced understanding of market dynamics, as well as pathways for investors to contribute to solutions. This article explores how food insecurity impacts market trends, what that means for investors, and the efforts underway to fight this complex issue. In 2022, more than 12% of American households had food insecurity during the year, and 5.1% or 6.8 million households had very low food security, according to government statistics. Food insecurity is a lack of reliable access and ability to affordable food. It\u2019s not just about hunger; it\u2019s a complex condition that involves economic, social, and geographic factors. In simple terms, if a household is uncertain about where its next meal will come from or has to choose between food and other basic needs like healthcare or housing, then it\u2019s facing food insecurity. Food insecurity can set off a chain reaction that eventually reaches the stock market. It starts at the household level, where the struggle to afford food frequently leads to reduced spending in other areas. When families cut back on food spending, they often cut expenditures in other sectors, such as retail, entertainment, and healthcare. This decline in consumer spending has a cascading effect on businesses. Companies that rely on consumer demand could see revenues drop, resulting in lower profit margins. In turn, these diminished earnings can negatively influence their stock prices. The stocks of companies in certain sectors are more exposed to the consequences of food insecurity than others. For example, companies in the food and beverage industry may experience decreased sales as consumers turn to cheaper options\u2014or none at all. Retailers, particularly those selling nonessential items, could have a slump in demand. Even the healthcare sector can be impacted as food-insecure individuals delay or forgo medical treatments because of financial constraints, affecting the revenue streams of healthcare companies. Beyond these tangible financial effects, food insecurity can also influence investor sentiment. For instance, rising levels of food insecurity could indicate economic instability, making investors more cautious. This caution might be seen in reduced investments in stocks considered to be riskier, contributing to market volatility. Consumer spending is not the only factor that affects corporate earnings and stock valuations. Other factors, such as supply shocks, technological innovations, competition, regulations, taxes, interest rates, exchange rates, or geopolitical events, can significantly affect the profitability and attractiveness of different businesses and industries. Therefore, the relationship among food insecurity, corporate earnings, and stock valuations is neither straightforward nor deterministic. Traditionally, investors look at indicators like price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, dividend yields, and earnings reports to assess the health and potential profitability of stocks. While these remain undoubtedly important, incorporating food insecurity data can add another layer to risk evaluation. Learning that certain sectors like food and retail are more sensitive to fluctuations in food insecurity levels allows investors to weigh their portfolios accordingly. For instance, if food insecurity rises, then stocks in these sectors might become riskier. Additionally, food insecurity can vary significantly by region. Investing in companies with heavy exposure to areas with high levels of food insecurity might also be seen as a higher risk. Food insecurity frequently correlates with broader economic conditions. For example, high levels of food insecurity could be an early warning sign of a looming recession. By keeping an eye on this metric, investors can be better equipped to navigate market downturns or capitalize on emerging opportunities. Donating a part of your investment gains to nonprofit organizations working to combat food insecurity can provide help as well as offer tax advantages. In many jurisdictions, charitable donations are tax-deductible, which can offset some of the capital gains tax you might owe on your investments. Governments worldwide use strategies to combat food insecurity, each tailored to their respective nations\u2019 distinctive challenges and resources. While the methods may vary, the goals are generally the same: to ensure that all citizens have reliable access to sufficient, healthy food. These include setting up and supporting direct food programs like food banks and food vouchers, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the United States. Providing free or subsidized meals in schools is another way to directly alleviate food insecurity among children and, by extension, their families. Investors can have a role in the fight against food insecurity. Not only do they frequently have the financial resources to make a difference, but they also can influence corporate behavior and public policy. Investors can try to influence change by consciously choosing to invest in companies that are committed to reducing food insecurity. Look for companies with clearly defined corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs to reduce food insecurity or related issues like poverty. This could range from food companies sourcing their products sustainably to technology companies developing platforms that help redistribute excess food. Companies that report their social impact metrics transparently can help you see what they are doing. Investing in companies with strong social initiatives is not just about doing good; it can also benefit your portfolio. Research has shown that companies with strong CSR initiatives frequently have a lower cost of capital, lower volatility, and higher profitability. Areas called \u201cfood deserts\u201d have limited access to affordable and nutritious food, making it harder for residents to maintain a healthy diet. In the U.S., there are counties that do not have a single grocery store, mainly in the Great Plains and Midwest regions. Food insecurity reduces consumer spending among those struggling, which can contribute to lower economic growth. The public costs of addressing health and educational disparities caused by food insecurity can also weigh on the economy to a certain degree. Food insecurity has the most significant impact in low-income communities and countries with high poverty rates. These areas are frequently ensnared in a cycle of poverty and food insecurity that hampers economic development. Countries facing critical levels of food insecurity in 2022 include Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Food insecurity can lead to health problems and decreased productivity among workers, affecting individual lives and overall economic output. When workers face health issues because of inadequate nutrition, they are more likely to miss work or perform at suboptimal levels, leading to decreased productivity. Despite being a wealthy nation, the U.S. grapples with food insecurity because of income and wealth disparities, structural inequalities, and inadequate social safety nets. Official statistics report that more than 12% of American households faced some degree of food insecurity during 2022, affecting tens of millions of people. The U.S. government has taken steps to better address food insecurity, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, through stimulus packages, extensions of unemployment benefits, and expansions of food assistance programs. However, these were mostly short-term solutions not meant to address the systemic issues that lead to food insecurity. While programs like SNAP exist, they frequently provide insufficient support to completely alleviate food insecurity. Food insecurity is a problem affecting millions of Americans and many millions more around the world. This lack of access or affordability to food is not an isolated problem; it has far-reaching implications that may include influencing the stock market. Understanding this connection can help investors make more informed decisions and potentially contribute to solutions that alleviate this pressing issue. Food insecurity in the U.S. gained attention and worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a complex issue requiring multifaceted solutions, involving not just food assistance but also broader economic and social reforms.

            "title": "Comparing Mid-Cap Indexes",
            "content": "There are four main mid-cap indexes, the CRSP, Dow, Russell, and S&P Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University. A mid-cap index provides a benchmark for investors interested in gauging the relative performance of mid-cap stocks or investment vehicles that hold mid-cap stocks, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. A mid-cap stock is defined as any equity security whose market capitalization, or market value generally falls between $2 billion and $10 billion. Some investment companies put the mid-cap range at about $3 billion to $10 billion. However, that range is not fixed, and its outer bounds are flexible. Despite those variances, mid-cap companies are generally in the middle of their growth curve and are expected to post sustained increases in their profits, market share, and productivity. Though not as risky as small-caps, mid-caps tend to be riskier than large-caps. There are a number of mid-cap indexes used as benchmarks to gauge the performance of mid-cap investments. None of them shares the kind of dominance and popularity of the S&P 500 Index, which is the default benchmark for many large-cap stocks and funds. Indeed, the top three large-cap ETFs by assets under management (AUM) all track the S&P 500. By contrast, each of the top three mid-cap ETFs tracks a separate index. And within the top 10, there are four separate broad-based indexes that are tracked (there are other indexes but they are themed indexes, such as value or growth, rather than broad-based). This is based on data from ETF Database as of April 7, 2022. Those four mid-cap indexes are: Unlike the large-cap universe, there is no clear index leader for mid-caps and the four indexes listed above vary quite a bit. This makes mid-cap investing a little more challenging than large-cap investing. Understanding which index to use as a benchmark for a particular investment is important for knowing whether or not the investment is outperforming or underperforming. Below, we look at the four mid-cap indexes listed above in more detail in order to give investors a better understanding of which mid-cap index to use for which type of mid-cap investments. Sources: data in rows from \"Number of Stocks\" to \"Weight of the Top 10\" is as of March 31, 2022, and is from: the CRSP U.S. Mid Cap Index; the Russell Midcap Index and iShares Russell Mid-Cap ETF, which tracks the Russell Midcap Index; the Dow Jones U.S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index (download factsheet PDF); and the S&P MidCap 400 Index (download factsheet PDF); all total return data is from YCharts as of April 5, 2022; note that the total return data for the Dow Jones U.S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index is based on the Schwab U.S. Mid-Cap ETF (SCHM), which tracks the index and has a fairly low expense ratio. Each of the four major mid-cap indexes uses slightly different breakdowns of the major market sectors. For example, DWM uses a \"Consumer Services\" sector and a \"Consumer Goods\" sector instead of the more traditional \"Consumer Discretionary\" and \"Consumer Staples\" sectors. It also calls its \"Energy\" sector \"Oil & Gas,\" and does not have a separate \"REITs/Real Estate\" sector. DWM and CRSPMI1 both use the old \"Telecommunications\" sector classification, which was replaced by \"Communication Services\" in 2018. The rest of the differences in classification are minor, with a slightly different name such as \"Materials\" instead of the traditional \"Basic Materials.\" Where there are differences in the naming of sectors used by the different indexes, we have indicated those differences in the corresponding cell within the table below. Also, take note that data for the sector breakdown was not available for RMCC and so the sector classification used by the iShares Russell Mid-Cap ETF (IWR), which tracks RMCC, was used instead as a proxy. Sources: the CRSP U.S. Mid Cap Index; the iShares Russell Mid-Cap ETF; the Dow Jones U.S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index (download Factsheet PDF); and the S&P MidCap 400 Index (download Factsheet PDF); all data as of March 31, 2022, except data for IWR (used for the Russell Midcap Index), which is as of April 7, 2022; percentage shares of sectors for each index may not add up to 100% due to rounding. Sources: ETF Database: the Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (VO), the iShares Russell Midcap ETF (IWR), the Schwab U.S. Mid-Cap ETF (SCHM), and the iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF (IJH); all data is as of April 7, 2022. Based on the four mid-cap indexes analyzed above, it's evident that \"mid-cap\" is a market-cap classification with flexible boundaries. None of the indexes sticks to the traditional market-cap range of between $2 billion and $10 billion. Nor do they contain the same number of constituents, with RMCC being the largest outlier at 824 total stocks. There are also significant differences in the sector breakdowns for each index. This should also help illustrate that, though market capitalization is an important factor when analyzing stocks, the dividing lines between the size categories companies are placed in are ultimately arbitrary. The index that most closely follows the traditional market-cap range is S&P 400. Its largest and smallest market cap are still outside the spectrum, but its range is the tightest compared to the other three indexes. S&P 400's range is from a low of $1.6 billion to a high of $17.3 billion. S&P 400's median and mean market caps are also somewhat close to the middle of the traditional classification range. In terms of sector breakdowns, S&P 400 gives a relatively high weighting toward industrials, at 18.7%, compared to CRSPMI1 and RMCC. However, that weighting is lower than the weighting for industrials used by DWM. The only other index for which the mean and median fall within the traditional range is DWM. Its mean and median market cap fall just below the upper boundary at $9.1 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively. However, the stock with the largest market cap within DWM is well above that upper boundary, with a market cap of $40.0 billion. DWM is also the index that has the stock with the smallest market cap at $40.9 million. Considering sector breakdowns, DWM is notable for its extremely large weightings toward financials and industrials, at 24.0% and 20.9%, respectively. RMCC has the stock with the largest market cap, at $61.4 billion. That probably helps to explain why the mean market cap of RMCC is $24.0 billion, more than double the upper boundary of a mid-cap stock's market-cap range. However, using IWR as a proxy (because data was not available for RMCC), the weight of its largest constituent, as well as the combined weight of the top 10 constituents, is the lowest out of all the indexes. RMCC (again using IWR as its proxy) gives the largest sector weightings for information technology and healthcare compared to the other indexes. Information technology is the sector that receives the largest weighting within the index. That skewing toward large-caps is most evident in CRSPMI1. The weight of its top 10 constituents is 6.7%, which represents the largest weighting out of all four indexes. To be sure, the $51.0 billion market cap of CRSPMI1's largest market-cap stock is lower than that of the RMCC, which is $61.4 billion, as mentioned. But both the mean and median market caps of CRSPMI1 are far above the traditional range for a mid-cap stock, at $18.2 billion and $19.0 billion, respectively. CRSPMI1 gives the largest weighting to utilities compared to the other three indexes. But the sector that receives the largest weighting by far in the index is information technology. Investors have four main indexes from which to choose a benchmark for gauging the performance of their mid-cap holdings. None of the indexes is more dominant than the others because each of them is tracked by some of the biggest mid-cap ETFs. They also have unique characteristics, so they are not interchangeable. Each of the indexes includes stocks that are not traditionally considered mid-caps, with a few of the indexes actually having mean and median market caps significantly above the upper boundary of the traditional mid-cap range. So though market cap is an important metric for investors to consider when looking at stocks, the boundaries of categories like \"mid-cap\" and \"large-cap\" are ultimately arbitrary, so that should be kept in mind. This is particularly clear in the mid-cap space where all four indexes vary widely in terms of their average market cap. The four indexes also vary both in their number of holdings and sector allocations. Investors should weigh all of these factors when choosing the index that meets their personal investing needs, taking into consideration their risk tolerance and their individual financial goals.

            "content": "Understanding different stock types can benefit your portfolio Skylar Clarine is a fact-checker and expert in personal finance with a range of experience including veterinary technology and film studies. When most people think of stocks, they typically think of publicly listed shares traded on the stock exchange. However, it's important for investors to know the different types of stocks available, understand their unique characteristics, and be able to determine when they may represent a suitable investment. Below, we outline the various stock categories, aiming to take the confusion out of differing stock classes on offer to investors. Common stock\u2014sometimes referred to as ordinary shares\u2014represents partial ownership in a company. This stock class entitles investors to generated profits, usually paid in dividends. Common stockholders elect a company's board of directors and vote on corporate policies. Holders of this stock class have rights to a company's assets in a liquidation event, but only after preferred stock shareholders and other debt holders have been paid. Company founders and employees typically receive common stock. On the other hand, preferred stock, or preference shares, entitles the holder to regular dividend payments before dividends are issued to common shareholders. As mentioned above, preferred shareholders also get repaid first if the company dissolves or enters bankruptcy. Preferred stock doesn't carry voting rights and suits investors seeking reliable passive income. Many companies offer both common and preferred stock. For example, Alphabet Inc.\u2014Google's parent company\u2014lists Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), its Class A common stock, and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), its preferred Class C stock. As their name suggests, growth stocks refer to equities expected to grow at a faster rate compared to the broader market. Generally, growth stocks tend to outperform during times of economic expansion and when interest rates are low. For instance, technology stocks have significantly outperformed in recent years, fueled by a robust economy and access to cheap funding. Investors can monitor growth stocks by following the themed exchange-traded fund (ETF), the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (SPYG). Conversely, value stocks trade at a discount to what a company's performance might otherwise indicate, typically having more attractive valuations than the broader market. Value stocks\u2014such as financial, healthcare, and energy names\u2014tend to outperform during periods of economic recovery, as they usually generate reliable income streams. Investors can track value stocks by adding the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF (SPYV) to their watchlist. Read about Investopedia's 10 Rules of Investing by picking up a copy of our special issue print edition. Income stocks are equities that provide regular income by distributing a company's profits, or excess cash, through dividends that are higher than the market average. Typically, these stocks\u2014think utilities\u2014have lower volatility and less capital appreciation than growth stocks, making them suitable for risk-averse investors who seek a regular income stream. Investors can access income stocks through the Amplify High Income ETF (YYY). Blue-chip stocks are well-established companies that have a large market capitalization. They have a long successful track record of generating dependable earnings and leading within their industry or sector. Conservative investors may top-weight their portfolio with blue-chip stocks, particularly in periods of uncertainty. Several examples of blue-chip stocks include computing giant Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), fast-food leader McDonald's Corporation (MCD), and energy bellwether Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM). Cyclical stocks are directly affected by the economy's performance and typically follow economic cycles of expansion, peak, recession, and recovery. They usually display more volatility and outperform other stocks in times of economic strength when consumers have more discretionary income. Examples of cyclical stocks include iPhone maker Apple Inc. (AAPL) and sports gear giant Nike, Inc. (NKE). Investors can add cyclical stocks to their portfolios by purchasing the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR). On the other hand, non-cyclical stocks operate in \"recession-proof\" industries that tend to perform reasonably well irrespective of the economy. Non-cyclical stocks usually outperform cyclical stocks in an economic slowdown or downturn as demand for core products and services remains relatively consistent. The Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC) provides exposure to large-cap defensive stocks like personal care giant The Procter & Gamble Company (PG), as well as beverage makers PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO). Defensive stocks generally provide consistent returns in most economic conditions and stock market environments. These companies typically sell essential products and services, such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. Defensive stocks may help protect a portfolio from steep losses during a sell-off or bear market. A defensive stock may also be a value, income, non-cyclical, or blue-chip stock. Telecommunications giant Verizon (VZ) and healthcare multinational Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH) are among the defensive stocks included in the core holdings of the Invesco Defensive Equity ETF (DEF). Defensive stocks are less likely to face bankruptcy because of their ability to generate consistent returns during periods of economic weakness. When a company goes public, it issues stock through an initial public offering (IPO). IPO stock typically gets allocated at a discount before the company's stock lists on the stock exchange. It may also have a vesting schedule to prevent investors from selling all of their shares when the stock commences trading. Market commentators also use the term \"IPO stocks\" when referring to recently listed stocks. Investors can monitor for upcoming IPOs through the Nasdaq website. A penny stock is equity valued at less than $5 and is considered highly speculative. Although some penny stocks trade on major exchanges, many trade through the OTCQB\u2014a middle-tier\u00a0over-the-counter (OTC) market for U.S. stocks operated by OTC Markets Group. Investors should consider using limit orders when placing buy and sell orders in penny stock, as they often have a large spread between the bid and ask price. Penny stocks shot to prominence in popular culture after the release of The Wolf of Wall Street, a movie about a former stockbroker who operated a penny stock scam. Investors who want to take a bet on penny stocks should look at the iShares Micro-Cap ETF (IWC). Environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) stocks emphasize environmental protection, social justice, and ethical management practices. For instance, an ESG stock may be a company that agrees to reduce its carbon emissions at a greater rate than national and industry targets or one that manufactures equipment for renewable energy infrastructure. ESG stocks have gained popularity with millennials in recent years\u2014a socially conscious generation who are more likely to invest in things they believe and support. Investors can access ESG stocks by adding the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV) to their portfolio. Preferred stock gives holders priority over a company's income but does not provide voting rights like common stock. Income stocks suit risk-averse investors who seek regular income through dividend payments. Defensive stocks generally provide consistent returns in most economic conditions and stock market environments. Investors can buy speculative penny stocks through the OTCQB\u2060\u2014a middle-tier\u00a0over-the-counter\u00a0(OTC) market for U.S. stocks operated by OTC Markets Group. Understanding the key differences between stock categories helps investors make better-informed investment decisions and manage risk within their portfolios. As well as buying different types of stocks directly, investors can gain cost-effective exposure to themed stock types through ETFs.

            "content": "Know your investment needs before selecting an online broker It\u2019s never been easier for traders to invest in today\u2019s volatile financial markets with a plethora of online trading platforms to choose from. However, with so many options to consider, selecting an online platform that meets your specific investment needs can be both time-consuming and overwhelming. To speed up the learning curve, let\u2019s walk through the basics of online investing and outline some of the important factors that traders need to consider before placing their first trade. When selecting an online broker, here are several essential things to consider. Ensure that the broker is registered to sell securities. Investors can do this easily by checking the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\u2019s\u00a0BrokerCheck and entering the broker\u2019s name in the search function. To protect your funds and identity, select an online broker that has enhanced security features\u2014such as two-factor authentication (2FA) and SMS/email notification login security alerts\u2014and agrees not to sell your personal information to third parties. If you intend to trade actively, it\u2019s important to choose an online broker that offers competitive trading commissions, as they can add up fast. Although many discount brokers offer zero commission, be aware that they may make money through a wider spread between the bid and ask price. Also, find out if the broker charges minimum deposit fees, annual or monthly account maintenance fees, data fees, and activity fees. Yes, some brokers will charge you for not trading within one calendar quarter! Make sure that the platform you select offers all the products that you want to trade. For instance, if you like to trade complex strategies that utilize different investment instruments, ensure that the platform offers stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), options, and futures trading. Well-known online trading apps like Robinhood and Webull are even starting to offer leading cryptocurrencies on their trading platform and trialing a new crypto wallet. Traders just starting may want to consider an online broker that offers a paper trading or stock simulation account to hone their skills before risking real money. What are other customers saying? Pay particular attention to reviews about customer service, platform usability, and account fees. To get a more accurate reflection, ensure that the broker has many reviews, and look for patterns in what customers are saying. For example, if many reviews are complaining about poor customer service, there\u2019s a good chance that the broker may need to improve in that area. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security system that requires two distinct forms of identification to access something. Investors can protect the security of their online trading accounts by setting up 2FA. Investors should familiarize themselves with basic order types that are universal across all trading platforms. Knowing how they work and when to use them helps get the best execution and manage risk. This is an order to buy or sell a security at the best available price. For example, suppose the bid/ask spread in Apple Inc. (AAPL) was $180.00\u2013$180.10, and a trader wanted to buy the stock at market. They would get an immediate fill at $180.10\u2014the best ask price. Traders typically use market orders when they want an immediate execution. A limit order specifies the maximum price that a trader is willing to pay for a security (buy limit order) or the minimum that they\u2019re prepared to accept (sell limit order). Let\u2019s revisit the example bid/ask spread in Apple being $180.00\u2013$180.10, but the trader thinks they can sell at a higher price. They could place a limit order at $200, meaning that their stock will not sell unless the bid price reaches at least $200. Limit orders are useful for traders who are more concerned about the price than immediate execution. This order helps control a trader\u2019s risk by buying or selling at the market price once a security has traded at or through a specific price. In other words, if the security reaches the trader\u2019s stop price, the order becomes a market order and executes at the next best available price. Let\u2019s say a trader purchases Apple stock for $200 but wants to exit the trade if the share price falls below $150. They would place a stop-loss order at $150. If the stock drops to $150, then the stop-loss order becomes a market order, and the trades get filled at the best available bid price. Online investors should get in the habit of always using stop-loss orders to minimize risk and protect their capital. As its name suggests, this type of order sets a specific price to close an open position at a profit. If the price of a security reaches the limit price, it will automatically trigger a sale. However, if the price doesn\u2019t reach the limit price, then the order remains unfilled. It\u2019s also called a buy stop order. For example, a trader who uses technical analysis has noticed overhead resistance on the Apple chart at $180. Therefore, they decide to place a take-profit order at $179 to close their long position should the stock retest that level. As well as these basic orders, many online trading platforms offer more complex order types, such as all or none (AON), fill or kill (FOK), and one-cancels-the-other (OCO). The size of the global online trading market topped over $8 billion in 2021, according to market research. There are plenty of free resources on the web to help with online investing.

Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin A meme stock refers to the shares of a company that have gained viral popularity due to heightened social sentiment. This social sentiment is usually due to activity online, particularly on social media platforms. These online communities can dedicate heavy research and resources toward a particular stock. Meme stocks often have heavier discourse and analysis in discussion threads on websites like Reddit and posts to followers on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook. Though some believe meme stock communities coordinate efforts to influence the prices of those shares, meme stock shareholders are often an unorganized set of independent individuals, each with their own investment views and preferences. Collectively, their independent actions have been shown to initiate short squeezes in heavily shorted names. As a result, meme stocks can become overvalued relative to fundamental technical analysis. A meme is an idea or some element of popular culture that spreads and multiplies across people\u2019s minds. Memes gained increasing prevalence and relevance as the internet and social media grew. They allow people to rapidly spread humorous, interesting, or sarcastic videos, images, or posts to others around the world. The rapid and multiplicative effect of sharing such posts could make them go viral. With the internet, chat rooms and discussion boards devoted to investing and promoting stocks also arose. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, these sites helped promote and drive up the prices of so-called dotcom stocks\u2014a bubble that famously burst with far-reaching economic consequences. Meme stocks, however, didn\u2019t truly emerge until the year 2020 via the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets. Unlike its predecessors and other investing message boards, WallStreetBets became known for its unconventional and often irreverent tone. In this and other forums that have popped up since, users work together to identify target stocks and then promote them, while also putting their own money to work. Unlike online pump-and-dump schemes aimed at defrauding unwitting investors, the promotion of meme stocks largely involves buying and holding with the above-mentioned strong hands even after the price spikes. The YouTube persona Roaring Kitty posted a future viral video laying out the case for why shares of brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop Corp. (GME) could soar from $5 to $50 per share in August 2020. In the video, he explained that the stock had among the highest short interest in the market, largely with short positions held by hedge funds\u2014and that these funds would need to cover their positions in the event of a massive short squeeze, driving the stock much higher. A few days later, the former CEO of Chewy.com and investor Ryan Cohen purchased an unknown amount of GME stock, which Gill acknowledged on Twitter (now X). In November 2020, it became public knowledge Cohen owned a 10% share in the company. On Jan. 12, he joined the board and the stock rose rapidly. By closing two days later, the value doubled; an 8x increase from the price at the time of Cohen\u2019s and Gill\u2019s previous posts. Then, in January 2021, the short squeeze that The Roaring Kitty had suggested earlier took place in earnest, with the price of GME shares exploding to nearly $500 amid a frenzy of short-covering and panic buying. The main victims of the squeeze ended up being a handful of hedge funds, some of which were forced to shut down due to heavy losses. As a result, the meme stock concept adopted a David vs. Goliath or Robin Hood connotation of taking from the rich Wall Street elite and rewarding the small retail investor. Roaring Kitty's real name is Keith Gill who was also on Reddit as u/deepF...Value and active on the subreddit r/wallstreetbets. After the initial meme stock craze, GameStop shares drifted steadily lower, settling at just over $10 a share by the Spring of 2024. However, in mid-May of that year, the stock experienced a sudden resurgence, fueled by the return of Keith Gill, aka \"Roaring Kitty,\" to social media. Gill, who had been largely absent from the public eye since the height of the meme stock frenzy in 2021, posted a cryptic image from his X account, which was viewed over 24 million times, followed by a series of movie-inspired video memes. While not making any recommendations or indications about GME or any other stocks, these posts nevertheless reignited frenzied interest in meme stocks, causing a massive surge in trading volume and price. GameStop shares skyrocketed nearly 100% on Tuesday, May 14, 2024, following a 74% increase the previous day. This rapid price appreciation caught short sellers off guard, resulting in significant losses estimated at over $1.3 billion in just the two days following Gill's tweets alone. The renewed meme stock rally also extended to other companies, such as AMC Entertainment, which saw its stock price jump 120% in early trading on Tuesday. AMC took advantage of the heightened interest by raising approximately $250 million through a share sale. Market analysts and observers drew parallels between the 2024 rally and the original meme stock phenomenon of 2021. However, opinions were divided on whether this new surge would have the same lasting impact or if it was simply a brief revival of the speculative fervor that had characterized the earlier event. Regardless, the sudden resurgence of meme stocks in May 2024 served as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of markets and the power of social media to drive investor behavior. Meme stock activity was given a great boost from bored individuals stuck at home during COVID-19 lockdowns combined with zero-commission brokerage apps like Robinhood. The Robinhood app saw overwhelming trading volume in meme stocks at times, causing multiple trade delays, outages, and platform crashes. This led to user outrage along with class action lawsuits as well as regulatory fines and restitution of approximately $70 million. While GameStop was the first successful meme stock, it was not the only one. WallStreetBets users quickly identified other downtrodden stocks with heavy short interest to boost. These included AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC), the movie theater chain that saw flagging profits amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and Blackberry Limited (BB), the outmoded smartphone maker. Both stocks also saw their shares rapidly increase by multiples. Indeed, as these became recognized meme stocks, members of r/wallstreetbets and similar outlets began to acknowledge the humor (for the \u201clulz\u201d) of seeing such legacy companies emerge from the ashes in the stock market. Some meme stocks did not fare as well as others, even with the occasional short squeeze. Other meme names have included, among others, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY), Koss Corp. (KOSS), Vinco Ventures (BBIG), Support.com, and even the meme stock enabler Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD). Meme stock communities have developed a specific lingo used in their posts online. Some of these terms include (along with emojis used to denote them online): Meme stocks have been a boon to investors, day traders, and brokerage platforms but companies have also capitalized on the meme stock phenomenon. As a result of sky-high prices and persistent demand for shares among individual investors, AMC Theaters CEO Adam Aron took advantage of the elevated valuation and engaged in a series of secondary (follow-on) offerings in 2021. This raised more than $1.5 billion in the first quarter (Q1) from voracious meme stock buyers. GameStop followed suit in 2021, raising nearly $1.7 billion via a secondary offering of 8.5 million additional shares at an average price of more than $200 per share. In 2022, Bed Bath & Beyond announced intentions to sell 12 million shares in a secondary offering as meme stock promoters pumped the value of its stock. However, the stock fell steeply following the company's announcement of the plan. One of the features of meme stocks, especially early on, has been that they tend to be heavily shorted names. This means that there is a lot of short interest in the stock, or that a large proportion of the company's outstanding shares have been sold short. Short selling is when somebody sells shares that they do not own, hoping to buy them back at a lower price. It is thus a bet that prices will go down. That seller must borrow shares from somebody who is long the stock in order to sell them. As more and more shares are sold short in this way, there are fewer shares left available to borrow. Once a stock becomes hard to borrow, even the most motivated short seller may be unable to do so. Meme stocks are often hard to borrow, with a high short-interest ratio. Stocks are sold short on margin (because they involve borrowed shares). As the price of the shorted stock rises, the short seller will begin to experience losses. These losses must be covered in a timely fashion, often prompted via margin calls, whereby the broker demands funds to make up for those paper losses. Ultimately, a short seller may run out of available funds to hold on to the short and will be forced to buy back the shares at a higher price and close out the position. If many shorts are forced to cover at once, it adds additional upward pressure on the stock's price as they are all forced to buy the stock and cover at ever higher prices. This is known as a short squeeze, and it accelerates a stock's price increases as more and more short sellers are forced to bail out to cut their losses. A meme is an idea that spreads rapidly among people. Memes began to take the form of humorous social media posts and viral videos with the advent of the internet. Meme stocks are so-named because ideas about them spread rapidly on social media and web forums. Meme stocks also see communities built around them that promote the hype and elaborate on the original meme, inventing specific terms and symbols to accompany the stock. Roundhill Investments came out with a meme stock-focused ETF in December of 2021 under the ticker symbol 'MEME'. MEME features an equal-weighted portfolio of 25 stocks based on social media popularity and market sentiment. Eligible securities are initially given a social media activity or \u201cmeme\u201d score, the number of times a firm or its ticker is mentioned on specific social media platforms over a trailing 14-day period, with consideration paid to their short interest. The top 25 such firms are included in the portfolio, which is re-examined and rebalanced twice a month. Single stock ETFs have also recently been introduced, which provide leveraged long or short positions on a single stock. Only a small number of these have been approved for trading so far, but do include some meme stocks like Tesla and NVIDIA. Meme stocks are actual stocks listed on exchanges and available for trade. In that sense they are real. However, critics argue that their price performance and appeal have little to do with their fundamentals and much to do with their entertainment value as speculative playthings, much like casino games. In general, many of the meme stocks that saw sky-high stock prices in 2021 have come down significantly in 2022. They are often now trading below where they started before the meme frenzy. Others, notably GameStop, remain elevated, although still far lower than its all-time highs. While some thought that the meme stock craze would be short-lived, the phenomenon remains in force years later. Meme stock communities pumped the brick-and-mortar retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) to extreme levels in the summer of 2022, when it was up 314% for a short period before crashing back down. Retail investors are also likely to remain keen to pick up on the latest meme stock. Dominated by younger investors, meme stocks are still seen as a way to generate outsized returns in a short period, especially in the face of rising housing costs and inflation in general. But meme stocks also remain very volatile and risky, and retail investors are likely to be the ones to experience the most losses when it all comes crashing down. So-called meme stocks became a hot investment theme for day traders and retail investors early in 2021, resulting in short squeezes on hot stocks at the time such as GameStop Corp. (GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC). Named after the virality of internet memes found on social media, these stocks saw online communities form around them to boost and hype their prospects, even though meme company fundamentals remained questionable.

Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. The Good Brigade / Getty Images Coming up with good gift ideas isn't always straightforward. Younger children usually desire the latest fad (which they'll probably soon lose interest in), while older generations tend to buy what they need and can be difficult to satisfy. In many ways, you can't go wrong with giving shares in a company as a gift. Sure, this may not generate as much excitement as, say, the latest PlayStation console or smartphone. However, working with your broker to give stock is one of the few things that has a decent chance of growing in value, turning money into more money. There are few gifts in stores that have that attribute. Buying gifts that adults actually want without breaking the bank is no easy task. But giving a share of company stock could perhaps help them one day generate enough money to purchase that one thing they don't have and have always wanted. For kids, it's a slightly harder sell because they may not have any long-term dreams for which they're actively saving up. But that's bound to change at some point in the future, and learning about managing money and investing early can serve them well later in life. There are many companies out there, and choosing the right stock(s) requires careful consideration. The goal is to make this gift as compelling and profitable as possible, so you\u2019ll want to consider the interests of the person for whom you are buying, as well as the growth potential. Consider what the recipient likes, and find a company that operates in that area. Then go through its accounts, apply some valuation metrics, or speak to an advisor to determine if it would make a good investment.\u00a0Your best bet would be to draw up a shortlist of several companies first and then analyze each until you find one that is attractively priced and poised to grow in value for years to come. If you need some inspiration, take a look at what stock gifting platform GiveAshare lists as the top 10 most popular stocks to give loved ones (as of October 2024): Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a great way to gift multiple stocks in one transaction. You can choose index-based ETFs, such as SPY, IVV, or VOO, among many others, all of which track the Standard & Poor's 500 (an index of 500 large U.S. companies). Or you can choose a sector-based ETF that reflects the interests of your gift recipient. A young one might be interested in planes, for instance, and there is a specific ETF that contains major airline stocks: JETS. There is virtually an ETF for almost any sector or asset class, which should make your decision a lot easier. You can search the web for a specific ETF that covers the sector, region, or index that might be interesting to your gift recipient, and you're likely to find many selections to choose from. Also, to make ETFs even more attractive, they function like regular shares and can be bought and sold on a fractional basis (see below), too. You might find that buying even one share in a company is more than you can afford or want to spend. In this case, fractional shares\u2014if available\u2014may be your best option. When they go public, companies issue a set number of shares, each of which represents a portion of ownership. However, it is sometimes possible to buy a slice of one share or stock, called a fractional share, and to essentially invest a dollar amount of your choosing in a given company. Unless you are feeling especially generous, this may be a necessary option for higher-priced shares. Many online brokerages permit investors to buy fractional shares for as little as $1 to $10. If you or the stock's recipient cares deeply about how companies behave and conduct their business, then environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments might be high on your shopping list. ESG investing basically involves purchasing stocks in companies that, according to independent third parties, prioritize corporate responsibility. Three boxes need to be checked before a company can qualify as an ESG leader, and they are: In short, the goal is to make as much money as possible by investing in companies that are deemed good for society. Obviously, going the ESG route means limiting your choice of available investments. However, there's also the argument that using an ESG-based screening process to select stocks will result in investment in companies that are at a lower risk of being hit by big scandals that damage their share prices. Gifting stocks has never been easier and can be achieved from the comfort of home fairly quickly. There are several options available to you. Some of the most common include: Before taking the leap and buying your loved ones a company's stock as gifts, it's important to be aware of any present or future tax bills. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) might charge you for making the gift if it's a large one. The recipient\u2014if all goes according to plan and the stock's value increases\u2014also will be expected to pay capital gains tax when they eventually decide to cash in on your present. The gift tax, a federal tax applied to gifts, won't be an issue for most people. Donors aren't taxed on stock gifts unless they are worth more than $18,000 in 2024 ($19,000 in 2025) and exceed the lifetime gift tax exemption, which as of 2024 is set at $13.61 million (increasing to $13.99 million in 2025). Spouses are excluded from this tax, too, so if you are gifting stock to your husband or wife, there\u2019s nothing to worry about. When a stock is eventually sold, the IRS must be notified, and the investor (the gift recipient, in this case) will be taxed accordingly, depending on the holding period, their tax bracket, and the gain that was made relative to the original purchase price. If the recipient sells the investment within one year at a profit, they will have made a short-term capital gain, which is taxed as ordinary income. Waiting beyond a year to sell generally leads to a better outcome because long-term gains are taxed at lower capital gains rates. Like ordinary income tax, capital gains rates become steeper as an individual's income for the tax year grows. Gift givers should also know that the recipient's capital gain is determined by how much the investment originally cost. In other words, if the stock was purchased for $100 and several years later sold for $1,000, the recipient would be taxed on a profit of $900. Of course, there's a chance that the gift doesn't pay off. If things go pear-shaped and the stock is eventually sold at a loss, it still must be reported. Fortunately, capital losses can serve as\u00a0deductions\u00a0on the investor's tax return, bringing down the total amount of capital gains or, failing that, shaving up to $3,000 per year off regular taxable income. Capital losses can also be deferred for use in future years until the total amount of the loss is exhausted. If you plan to give stock to a minor, you can set up a custodial account on their behalf. You'll then be in charge of the stock held in the account until the child reaches a certain age, usually 18 or 21. Hopefully, by then, the beneficiaries will be mature enough to manage their own finances and make smart investment decisions. Gifts are only taxed if they are worth more than $18,000 in 2024 or $19,000 in 2025, not destined for a spouse, and exceed the lifetime gift tax exemption, which as of 2024 is set at $13.61 million and for 2025, $13.99 million. These generous allowances generally mean that a taxable event isn't triggered until the gifted stock is eventually disposed of by the recipient. The amount of tax paid on a profitable sale depends on the\u00a0beneficiary's income,\u00a0the holding period,\u00a0and the gain that was made relative to the original purchase price.\u00a0Losses, too, must be declared but can be used to reduce tax liabilities. Absolutely. The owner of company stocks is permitted to transfer ownership without incurring any penalties. The process is fairly straightforward. Online brokers usually provide an option to make a transfer on their platforms. All you need to do is give your written consent and basically fill out some forms. Physical share certificates, too, can change hands. To complete this type of transaction, you'll need to get in touch with the company's transfer agent, whose contact information should be visible in the investor relations section of the company's website. Looking for a gift for someone's birthday or the holidays but coming up short on ideas? You might want to consider giving a gift of stock. You'd be giving a present that has the potential to grow in value over the years, and not many gifts can offer that. It's easy to give a gift of stock through your brokerage account, directly with a share transfer, or from the company itself. With thousands of stocks, it can be hard to decide which to choose. If that's the case, you might want to consider ETFs, which are baskets of multiple stocks represented by a single share or more. Also, consider using fractional shares to give a portion of an expensive stock or simply to give a gift based on a dollar amount. There are unlikely to be any immediate tax consequences in giving a gift of stock. More likely, the tax considerations would come when the shares are sold in the future.

When you day trade, you buy and sell stocks, forex, futures, or options with the expectation of holding your position for less than a day. A typical holding period for a day trading is just a few minutes or until the price has reached its objective, which might just be one or two ticks of price movement. Traders rely on charting to analyze price movements and trading patterns to identify indicators and trends that reveal a potentially profitable trade. Traders also incorporate the psychology of the market and how investors are impacting price changes. Regardless of your knowledge or experience level, a good day trading course can be invaluable for getting you to the next level, whether that is to start day trading or sharpen your skills for more profitable trading. If you're just starting out, you may want to enroll in a free or low-cost course to learn the basics of day trading and then look for a paid course to leverage your knowledge so you can get more out of it.

            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Founded in 1976, Apple (AAPL) became the first U.S. corporation to surpass $1 trillion in market capitalization in 2018. The company's spectacular growth in sales, profits, and share price were historically driven by solid sales of its iPhone products. But as sales of the popular smartphone and other technology hardware devices slowed down, the company made aggressive efforts to transform itself into one of the world's leading providers of digital services. But what are the company's most popular and most successful business segments? This article examines Apple's most profitable business lines and how they contribute to its success. Even though Apple's fiscal year 2019 was characterized by a series of ups and downs, it successfully boosted its revenue from its services division. But earnings from its most popular products, such as iPhones and MacBook laptops, fell somewhat below 2018 levels. For the first fiscal quarter of 2020, Apple forecast revenue between $85.5 billion and $89.5 billion. The company announced revenue of $91.8 billion and profit of $22.2 billion\u2014an all-time record for both net income and revenue. In the 2019 fiscal year, Apple posted sales of $260.2 billion on a net income of $55.2 billion. In the first quarter of 2019, earnings came in at $4.18 on a per-share basis. This was a record high for the company. But in the first fiscal quarter of 2020, earnings per share were up to $4.99. Here is a more detailed look at Apple's five most profitable business lines as they perform today. Apple\u2019s core product is the iPhone. The popular smartphone is among the top five smartphone vendors in the world. Demand remained strong after the company released the iPhone 13, which the company states is \"setting a new standard for performance and empowering our customers to create and connect in new ways. Sales for this model reportedly exceeded those for the iPhone 12, which still \"skyrocketed\" as of December 2021. The company reported net sales for the iPhone unit of $192 billion for the 2021 fiscal year compared to $137.8 reported in the year before. Sales hit $38.9 billion during the fourth quarter\u2014up 47% from the same quarter of 2020, which earned $26.4 billion. The company blamed the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic for lower-than-expected iPhone sales. Previous declines in iPhone sales were attributed to a slowdown in China, a longer iPhone replacement cycle, and heightened competition in the global smartphone market. Apple reportedly had to cut production of the iPhone 13 because of ongoing issues with supply reductions from its manufacturing partners. The company's services business is led by the App Store and Apple Music. The segment's revenue also comes from selling a range of services, such as AppleCare, Apple Pay, iCloud storage services, AppleCare warranties, and subscriptions to services like Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, and the Apple Card, which competes with other financial payment giants. Apple\u2019s Services segment posted revenue of $68.4 billion during the 2021 fiscal year and $18.3 billion for the fourth quarter. This is compared to $53.8 billion for the previous year and $14.5 during Q4-2020. This represented an all-time high for the unit. The end of Apple's fiscal year doesn't include sales for the holiday season and the three most lucrative months of the year\u2013October, November, and December. This period is a very important period for Apple. Apple\u2019s personal computer business is built around the Mac and includes its MacBook laptops and the iconic iMac desktop computers. This unit generated sales of $35.1 billion ($9.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021), which is an increase from the $28.6 billion reported in 2020 ($9 billion in Q4-2020). Mac\u2019s contribution to Apple's growth has consistently fallen as the personal computer industry experiences slowing demand worldwide. Keep in mind, though, that Apple\u2019s personal computer business is very important for the company from a strategic perspective. That's because it's part of a broad, interlinked product family running on the iOS operating system. When Apple launched its iPad in 2010, it quickly became the first commercially successful tablet computer to hit the market. In the first three months after it was released, the device sold more than three million units. Although worldwide demand for tablets is waning, Apple continues to dominate this part of the market. This unit drew in sales of $31.9 billion during the 2021 fiscal year and $8.3 billion during the year's fourth quarter. That's compared to $23.7 billion and $6.8 billion for the 2020 fiscal year and Q4-2020, respectively. Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment is made up of devices such as AirPods, Apple Watch, and HomePods. The segment posted $38.4 billion in revenue during 2021 and $8.8 billion for the year's fourth quarter. That's compared to $30.6 billion and $7.9 for the same periods in 2020, respectively.

            "content": "A guide to the grouping of Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Airbnb Caleb\u00a0has been the Editor-in-Chief of Investopedia since 2016. He is an award-winning media executive with more than 20 years of experience in business news, digital publishing, and documentaries. Caleb is the on the Board of Governors and Executive Committee of SABEW (Society for Advancing Business Editing & Writing), and his awards include a Peabody, EPPY, SABEW Best in Business, and two\u00a0Emmy nominations. Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University. Investopedia / Ellen Lindner LUPA stocks are a nickname for four companies born in the mobile app generation\u2014Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Airbnb. LUPA is the nickname for the stocks of four companies that were born in the mobile app generation. Also called the PAUL stocks, they include Lyft Inc. (LYFT), Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER), Pinterest Inc. (PINS), and Airbnb Inc. (ABNB). All four companies are actively traded on public stock exchanges. Lyft, the popular ride-sharing app based in San Francisco, was founded in 2007 as Bounder Web, Inc. It changed its name to Zimride in 2008 and then to Lyft in 2012. It was founded by entrepreneurs Logan Green and John Zimmer. After years of struggling, Lyft finally delivered its first-ever quarter of generally accepted accounting principles-based profitability in the second quarter of 2024. While it remains to be seen if the trend continues, Lyft offered guidance to being free-cash-flow positive for the full fiscal year. Struggles with unit economics and years of unprofitability resulted in Lyft shares falling about 83% between its 2019 IPO and September 2024. Uber, Lyft's key competitor in the ride-sharing economy, has had a busy decade since it was formed in 2009 as UberCab. The brainchild of entrepreneurs Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp, the ride-sharing app operates globally. Since 2022, Uber has focused on expanding its business beyond ride-hailing, including growing its food delivery service, Uber Eats, and freight services. Uber's forays into advertising have also paid off, with revenue run-rate from advertising exceeding $1 billion in the second quarter of 2024. Success from loyalty programs such as Uber One has also translated into ridership, with gross bookings growing 19% year-over-year during the same quarter. Unlike its competitor, Lyft, early investments in Uber have paid off, with the shares rising 46% since its initial public offering (IPO). The best-known informal stock grouping is FAANG: Meta Platforms' Facebook (META), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NFLX), and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL). The popular photo-sharing online pin-up board was the vision of entrepreneurs Ben Silbermann, Paul Sciarra, and Evan Sharp, who founded the company in 2010. Pinterest's ad strategy focuses on blending advertisements into its user experience by positioning ads as engaging, shoppable content that aligns with user intent, particularly for those seeking inspiration or products. This approach to ecommerce seems to be working, as Pinterest reported a 21% year-over-year revenue growth to $854 million and a 12% increase in global monthly active users, reaching 522 million for its second quarter of 2024. The stock is up about 25% since its IPO in 2019. The popular peer-to-peer short-term lodging rental platform has disrupted the travel industry in ways its founders may not have imagined when it was launched in 2008. The company also has expanded into tourism services and other ventures. As of 2024, Airbnb has not shed its regulatory woes, particularly in major cities like New York and San Francisco, where strict short-term rental laws have been put in place to address concerns over housing affordability and community impact. These issues aside, Airbnb continues to be very profitable, generating an adjusted\u00a0EBITDA\u00a0of $894 million and a free cash flow of $1 billion in the second quarter of 2024. The strong financial performance was the result of improving listing quality, which saw Airbnb remove 200,000 listings that did not meet guest expectations and expand into underutilized markets. As of Sept. 26, 2024, Airbnb shares were down about 12% since its IPO in 2020. Before purchasing a stock, it's best to talk to a reputable financial advisor to determine whether it matches your investing strategy, risk tolerance, and goals. Stocks with no par value are called no-par stocks. These stocks rely entirely on the market for valuation. A stock's float is its total number of shares available for trading. Traders generally have their own preferences for determining a good float, but a range of between 10% and 25% is common. LUPA stocks (Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Airbnb) represent four of the most notable companies born from the mobile app generation, each having faced significant challenges since their IPOs. While Uber and Airbnb have achieved solid profitability and growth, Lyft is still working through operational and market hurdles, only posting its first-ever quarter of GAAP profitability in the second quarter of 2024. Pinterest continues to create newer types of engaging ads, which has translated into a growing user base growth and is holding its own against ad giants such as Meta and Alphabet. Despite regulatory challenges, particularly for Uber and Airbnb, these companies continue to evolve and adapt to market demands.

            "title": "Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Definition and History",
            "content": "Daniel has 10+ years of experience reporting on investments and personal finance for outlets like AARP Bulletin and Exceptional magazine, in addition to being a column writer for Fatherly. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is a benchmark interest rate for dollar-denominated derivatives and loans that replaced the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). SOFR took the place of LIBOR in June 2023, offering fewer opportunities for market manipulation and current rates rather than forward-looking rates and terms. The SOFR is an influential interest rate banks use to price U.S. dollar-denominated derivatives and loans. The daily SOFR is based on transactions in the Treasury repurchase market, where investors offer banks overnight loans backed by their bond assets. Benchmark rates such as the SOFR are essential in derivatives trading\u2014particularly interest-rate swaps, which corporations and other parties use to manage interest-rate risk and to speculate on changes in borrowing costs. Interest-rate swaps are agreements in which the parties exchange fixed-rate interest payments for floating-rate interest payments. For example, in a \u201cvanilla\u201d swap, one party agrees to pay a fixed interest rate, and, in exchange, the receiving party agrees to pay a floating interest rate based on the SOFR\u2014the rate may be higher or lower than SOFR, assessed on the party\u2019s credit rating and interest-rate conditions. In this case, the payer benefits\u00a0when interest rates go up because the value of the incoming SOFR-based payments is now higher, even though the cost of the fixed-rate payments to the counterparty remains the same. The inverse occurs when rates go down. The LIBOR was previously the go-to interest rate at which investors and banks pegged their credit agreements to. Comprised of five currencies and seven maturities, the LIBOR was determined by calculating the average interest rate at which major global banks borrow from one another. The five currencies were the U.S. dollar (USD), euro (EUR), British pound (GBP), Japanese yen (JPY), and the Swiss franc (CHF). The most commonly quoted LIBOR was the three-month U.S. dollar rate, at the time referred to as the current LIBOR rate. Following the financial crisis of 2008, regulators grew wary of overreliance on LIBOR. For one, it was based largely on estimates from global banks that were surveyed\u2014but not necessarily on actual transactions. The downside of giving banks that much freedom became apparent in 2012 when it was revealed that more than a dozen financial institutions fudged their data in order to reap bigger profits from LIBOR-based derivative products. In addition, banking regulations after the financial crisis meant that there was less interbank borrowing happening, prompting some officials to express concern that the limited volume of trading activity made the LIBOR even less reliable. Eventually, the British regulator that compiled LIBOR rates said it would no longer require banks to submit interbank lending information after 2021. This update sent developed countries around the world scrambling to find an alternative reference rate that could eventually replace it. In 2017, the Federal Reserve (Fed) responded by assembling the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, composed of several large banks, to select an alternative reference rate for the United States. The committee chose the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), an overnight rate, as the new benchmark for dollar-denominated contracts. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing the SOFR in April 2018 as part of the effort to replace LIBOR. Unlike the LIBOR, there\u2019s extensive trading in the Treasury repo market\u2014roughly $4.8 trillion in June 2023\u2014theoretically making it a more accurate indicator of borrowing costs. Moreover, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is based on data from observable transactions rather than on estimated (or falsified) borrowing rates, as was generally the case with LIBOR. On Nov. 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced the LIBOR would be phased out and eventually replaced by June 2023. In the same announcement, banks were instructed to stop writing contracts using LIBOR by the end of 2021. The LIBOR and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) coexisted until June 2023, when SOFR became the standard in the U.S. The move to the SOFR is expected to have the greatest impact on the derivatives market. However, it should also play an important role in consumer credit products\u2014including some adjustable-rate mortgages and private student loans\u2014as well as debt instruments such as commercial paper. In the case of an adjustable-rate mortgage based on the SOFR, the movement of the benchmark rate determines how much borrowers will pay once the fixed interest period of their loan ends. If the SOFR is higher when the loan \u201cresets,\u201d homeowners will be paying a higher rate as well. Other countries have sought alternatives to the LIBOR. For instance, the United Kingdom chose the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA), an overnight lending rate, as its benchmark for sterling-based contracts going forward. The European Central Bank (ECB), on the other hand, opted to use the Euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA), which is based on unsecured overnight loans, while Japan applied its own rate, called the Tokyo overnight average rate (TONAR). On June 1, 2023, the SOFR was 5.08%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. SOFR measures the broad cost of overnight cash borrowing, using Treasury securities as collateral. LIBOR was the rate banks used to borrow from each other internationally\u2014it was sunsetted in June 2023. The Federal Reserve does not publish a three-month SOFR rate, but the Chicago Mercantile Exchange publishes one-, three-, six-, and 12-month Term SOFR rates for derivatives markets. The Secured Overnight Lending Rate (SOFR) is the benchmark for interest rates on dollar-denominated loans and derivatives. It replaced the London Intrabank Offered Rate in 2023, which was the globally accepted rate before SOFR was adopted. SOFR reflects an overnight rate, whereas LIBOR was a forward-looking rate, making SOFR much less susceptible to market fluctuations and manipulation.

            "title": "Does Prime Day Impact Amazon's Stock (AMZN)?",
            "content": "Stella Osoba is the Senior Editor of trading and investing at Investopedia. She co-founded and chaired Women in Technical Analysis. She has 15+ years of experience as a financial writer and technical analyst. In each of the years since Prime Day's inception, gross merchandise sales have increased, growing from $0.9 billion in 2015 to $12.09 billion in 2022. But as a $1.3 trillion company with annual revenue of almost half a trillion dollars, sales of $12 billion are not likely to have a major impact on the value of the company as a whole. A close look at Amazon's (AMZN) daily price chart since the beginning of the century shows the company has been in an impressive uptrend since well before the launch of Prime Day in 2015. In fact, if we were to look for bumps in share price as a result of Prime Day sales, the result would likely be insignificant at best. That's not to say there's no impact. The first Prime Day lasted for 24 hours and included nine countries. Amazon reported that the next Prime Day, which was on July 12, 2016, saw subscriber offers jump 60% from the prior year. The success of Prime Day led to Amazon extending the sale in 2017 to 30 hours. In 2018, Amazon added more markets and extended the sale to 36 hours. By 2019, Amazon had expanded the sale to include more countries and two full days. In its 2021 letter to shareholders, Amazon reported that it had 200 million Prime members worldwide. On a price-adjusted basis, AMZN was trading at $0.80 at the close of trading on July 15, 2002. By close of trading on July 15, 2022, the adjusted stock price was $113.55 for a price increase of 14,040%. With such impressive sales numbers, it is interesting to look at whether opportunities for short-term traders to take advantage of any bump in share price caused by the effects of Prime Day sales exist. Amazon is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalization exceeding $1.3 trillion. The company continued to grow by introducing new products and acquiring complementary businesses. One such product is Amazon Prime. This membership service gives subscribers certain perks like free two-day shipping of products, access to movies, music, and more. Amazon Prime's popularity encouraged the company to add another perk to reward its members. Prime Day was created in July 2015 to celebrate 20 years of being in business. There have only been seven Prime Day sales events, constituting too small a number to reach any statistically significant conclusions. But nevertheless, it is interesting to look at the stock price before and after Prime Day for any short-term tradable price action. If you were to buy the shares of AMZN at the close on the day prior to the first Prime Day sales and hold for a period ranging from one day, five days (one week) and 20 days (one month) after Prime Day, would there be any appreciable difference in price from the period a month earlier? The first table below shows the profits or losses to be gained from buying shares of AMZN at the close prior to Prime Day and then selling at the close one day, five days (one week), or 20 days (one month) after Prime Day. The results are not impressive and produce a combined loss for all time periods. If your trading strategy had been to buy at the close the day before Prime for the last seven years and sell one day, one week, or one month later. Each time period results in negative returns. The second table moves the time that shares are purchased approximately one month before Prime Day in each of the seven years. This is to provide a comparison of a random time frame. We can see that this random time period produces slightly better results across all time frames. (When dates fall on a weekend, days are moved back or forward to the next tradable day). For the one-day strategy, the average results are slightly better at $0.65 than the results for the post-Prime period at -$1.53. For the one-week strategy, the results are also slightly better than the post-Prime period at -$6.26 as opposed to -$10.81. The most impressive results are for the pre-Prime period of holding for one month at gains of $35.81 as opposed to the losses in the post-Prime period of -$8.27. Amazon is a juggernaut. Even though Prime Day sales of $12 billion in 2022 seem impressive. It is worth noting that the total revenue for this company in 2021 was $469,822,000. $12 billion is less than 3% of its total revenue. From this perspective it makes sense that the impact of Prime Day sales on the company's share price would be insignificant at best. It is useful to remember that the stock market acts as a forward-looking discounting mechanism. This means that the market will usually incorporate all publicly available information into the price of the stock. By the time the news is out about a particular event that had been anticipated by the market, it is usually too late to profit from it. Shocks to the market and individual stock prices usually happen when information that had not been expected occurs."

            "title": "Best Undervalued Stocks for November 2024",
            "content": "UCG\u00a0/\u00a0Getty Images Value investing is the strategy of buying stocks whose prices don\u2019t reflect what the underlying company is fundamentally worth. When successful, value investors stock up on high-quality companies while their valuations are still low, then stand to benefit when the market corrects itself later. Value investing is the market\u2019s version of finding a lost masterpiece at a flea market\u2014just with a bit more method and deliberation. For November 2024, the most undervalued stocks\u2014those with the lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios for each sector\u2014include software company Diebold Nixdorf, Inc. (DBD), oil and gas company Valaris Limited (VAL), health care company Roivant Sciences (ROIV), and Belgian international shipping company CMB.TECH NV (CMBT). Below, we look at the top undervalued stocks listed on either the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as measured by P/E ratio. The data below are current as of Oct. 27, 2024. We use the 12-month trailing P/E ratio as the metric for the top undervalued stocks listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq for each sector. Our screen includes stocks on either of those exchanges with a price of at least $5 per share, a daily trading volume of at least 100,000, and a market capitalization of at least $300 million. The P/E ratio is generally seen as a key metric for value investors, with a lower P/E ratio suggesting a more attractively valued company. However, there are some things a potential investor should keep in mind: P/E ratio is only one metric. Although it is well-established as an important measure of the relationship between the intrinsic value of a company and the price of its stock, P/E ratio is only one measure of a company's value. Looking at the company's financials and other metrics more holistically will give investors the best picture. Intrinsic value is hard to measure. It can be difficult to pinpoint the intrinsic value of a company, and many investors approach doing so as a type of educated guessing. With that in mind, it's possible that stocks that appear undervalued based on one or more metrics may not actually be. The market is unpredictable. Even if a stock is undervalued, there is no guarantee that the market will correct the mispricing. Industry-wide, sector-wide, or even market-wide phenomena can override this correction and lead to unpredictable price swings. Different industries and sectors have dramatically different norms for trailing P/E ratios. What is an astonishingly high P/E ratio in one sector may be normal or even low in another. Thus, it's essential that investors compare apples to apples; look not only for the lowest P/E ratio you can find, but also at competitors in the same industry or sector and at sector-wide metrics. Above, we consider stocks based on a 12-month trailing P/E ratio. Investors may also want to consider forward P/E ratios, which take into account not real historical earnings for a company but expert forecasts from Wall Street analysts. This may help to factor in developments that are on the horizon for a company, although without the hard data of historical earnings, these figures can be highly speculative. The price-to-book ratio is another metric used to gauge whether a company is undervalued based on its stock price. Instead of earnings, though, this ratio compares a stock price against a company's net value (assets less liabilities). This is a measure of stock price against a company's\u00a0book value per share and tells you how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a firm's net value. This is a modified version of the P/E ratio above. Unlike P/E, the price/earnings-to-growth ratio also takes into account future earnings growth. It compares P/E and expected earnings growth to attempt to measure whether a company is undervalued relative to its potential for future earnings. Investors attempting to buy stocks that are undervalued on the market compared with their intrinsic worth are using a value-based investing approach. Companies sometimes fly under the radar, with stock trading at a discount compared with what it is actually\u2014and, hopefully, eventually\u2014worth. The P/E ratio is one of several metrics used to gauge whether a stock is over- or under-valued. It's important to keep in mind that P/E ratio is only one of several value-investing metrics and that these ratios will differ depending upon the nature of the company, industry, or sector. Similarly, just because a company has a low P/E ratio relative to its competitors does not necessarily mean that the company's stock will increase.

Smith Collection/\u00a0Getty Images October brought significant developments in the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape. On Oct. 24, the Biden Administration issued a national security memorandum emphasizing the importance ofmaintaining U.S. leadership in AI development, attracting global AI talent, and expanding infrastructure to support AI capabilities. This announcement followed Amazon's (AMZN) disclosure of three new agreements to support nuclear power generation for its cloud applications. These developments underscore both the growing influence of AI in policymaking and the critical power infrastructure required to support an AI-driven future. Below, we explore the best\u00a0AI stocks\u00a0for November 2024, considering those with the best value,fastest growth, and most momentum. Data are current as of Oct. 26, 2024. Value investing is a strategy based on the principle that some stocks trade at prices that are below their intrinsic value. Investors able to identify these stocks, usually through analysis of fundamental metrics, may be primed for a return on their investment when the market corrects the mispricing and the stocks rise. One such metric is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Lower P/E ratios are generally considered to be signs of a more attractively valued company since it is valued at less than its fundamental value. Investors often evaluate growth stocks based on revenue and earnings per share (EPS), as these are key measures of a company's performance. Looking at only one of these two factors, however, can leave your search susceptible to temporary phenomena, including tax law changes or one-off gains. We aim for a more balanced screen of AI growth stocks by looking at the most recent year-over-year percentage growth for both revenue and EPS, giving each equal weighting. We also exclude companies with growth rates in either category of 1,000% or more on the grounds that these are likely outliers. Momentum investing is based on the principle that stocks that have increased at a faster rate compared with the market or their peers are likely to continue on that trajectory, at least in the short term, as long as there aren't fundamental changes to those companies' operations or the broader industry. Below, we look at the AI stocks that have provided the highest total return in the last 12 months. Broad applications Fast-moving innovation Popular trend Industry uncertainty Untested companies Dangers of AI Broad applications: AI has transformed\u2014or has the potential to transform\u2014a host of different industries and sectors. Companies positioned as leaders within the AI space could be well-positioned to benefit from widespread adoption and a broad, diverse customer base. Fast-moving innovation: AI is at the forefront of innovation today, with both major tech firms and smaller up-and-coming companies working diligently to advance this technology. This means that the potential for breakthrough success may be huge as the industry continues to evolve. Popularity: As of mid-2024, AI is still one of the most talked-about trends in technology. Interest in this space is very high, meaning that investors could be poised to benefit from tremendous momentum with the right investments. Industry uncertainty: Although AI has been in existence for decades, it is only in the last several years that technological developments have brought this field into the mainstream. With changes and advancements happening incredibly quickly, it can be difficult for even the most knowledgeable investors to keep pace with what is happening in the industry. For instance, this means it could be easy for investors to get caught up in the hype surrounding a particular company after the ideal time to purchase that company's stock. Untested companies: While many of the major tech firms are involved in AI, other AI companies have little history and foundation for investors to consider when selecting investments. These companies may pose a greater risk than more stable, time-tested firms. Dangers of AI: Leaders in computer science and related fields have warned of the potential dangers associated with AI. As the field continues to expand and change, public opinion, regulations, and other factors may change and have the potential to impact AI stocks in unexpected ways. AI stocks present investors with the opportunity to tap into one of the most popular\u2014and potentially most revolutionary\u2014technology trends today. With companies across virtually all industries and sectors exploring ways to integrate AI into their operations, firms that are focused on the hardware and software required to run AI programs stand to benefit. But there are significant risks to investing in AI stocks, including the uncertain future of the industry and the potential dangers of AI technology itself.

            "title": "Magnificent 7 Stocks: What You Need to Know",
            "content": "\u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d was originally a reference to a 1960 Western film, \u201cThe Magnificent Seven,\u201d which was directed by John Sturges and depicts a group of seven gunmen. In the world of finance, the term has been repurposed to reference a group of seven high-performing and influential stocks in the technology sector, borrowing from the meaning of a powerful group. Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett coined the phrase in 2023 when commenting on the seven companies commonly recognized for their market dominance, their technological impact, and their changes to consumer behavior and economic trends: Alphabet (GOOGL; GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). For investors considering Magnificent Seven stocks, it is essential to understand their unique position in the market. These companies are at the forefront of sectors such as artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, cloud computing, and digital services, and still have the potential for significant growth. Yet, investing in them still carries risks since these factors have already been priced in. There are also the usual risks of market volatility, regulatory changes, technological disruptions, and global economic conditions that can influence their performance. Therefore, while these stocks present exciting prospects, they also require a nuanced understanding of the technology sector\u2019s prospects and a strategic investment approach. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol The Magnificent Seven stocks are a group of the most influential companies in the U.S. stock market. This term has been popularized to describe a set of dominant companies, particularly in the tech sector. The group comprises Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla, and spans four sectors: technology services, electronic technology, retail trade, and consumer durables. They operate across these industries: Internet software/services, telecommunications equipment, Internet retail, packaged software, semiconductors, and motor vehicles. \u201cThey are the highest quality names out there and, frankly, if we do go into a recession next year...I actually think the Magnificent Seven will hold up better,\u201d King Lip, chief strategist for BakerAvenue Wealth Management, told Reuters in November 2023. The table below displays the performance of the Magnificent Seven stocks over the last six months, one year, and five years. Over the past five years, NVIDIA has led the pack with an impressive return of approximately 3,000%, closely followed by Tesla, which has had a robust performance with over a 1,200% gain. All others had returns exceeding 100%, with Apple exhibiting the highest return at approximately 330%. The group of stocks known as the Magnificent Seven are at the forefront of technological changes across the economy, and they consistently develop new products and services that drive consumer demand and business growth. Here are other traits common among the Magnificent Seven stocks: Because of their size and reach, these companies all face regulatory risks. Regulation changes, especially in data privacy, antitrust laws, and international trade, can significantly influence these companies. More broadly, widespread economic changes affect them because of their broad reach, including interest rates, inflation, economic growth, consumer confidence, and investor sentiment. In finance and investing, FAANG is an acronym for the shares of five major American tech giants: Meta Platforms (previously Facebook, hence the \u201cF\u201d), Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix (NFLX), and Alphabet (previously Google, hence the \u201cG\u201d). Jim Cramer, host of CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money,\u201d and technical analyst Bob Lang coined the term in 2013, inserting an extra \u201cA\u201d for Apple in 2017. FAANG and the Magnificent Seven are both groups of dominant technology firms, yet they have notable differences. The Magnificent Seven group contains a wider array of technology and innovation-driven companies than the more narrowly focused FAANG. Investing in an S&P 500 ETF will provide you exposure to all Magnificent 7 and FAANG stocks. It includes behemoths like Microsoft and Tesla, extending its clout across diverse sectors such as software development, hardware, electric vehicles, and artificial intelligence. By contrast, FAANG stocks are predominant within Internet services, e-commerce, and digital media. Characterized by their robust growth, market-leading roles, and influence across various technology domains, the Magnificent Seven capture a broader spectrum of the tech industry. Conversely, FAANG is renowned for its rapid expansion, particularly in the Internet and digital media segments. In recent years, it has been pivotal in driving the technology sector\u2019s rally. Thus, while both groups have overlapping members and are powerful forces in the tech world, the Magnificent Seven have more extensive representation across the tech sector. Like any investment, putting your money into the Magnificent Seven stocks means taking on risks and challenges. Despite their strong market positions and record of driving technology forward, these companies face factors that could determine their performance. Here are some of them: The total market capitalization of the Magnificent Seven stocks was $16 trillion as of June 26, 2024. Yes, there are Magnificent 7 ETFs. One such ETF is the MAGS Magnificent 7 ETF by Roundhill Investments. You can also gain exposure to the magnificent stocks by investing in ETFs that hold them, such as any ETF that tracks the S&P 500. The impact of inflation on the Magnificent Seven is complex. Some key ways that inflation would affect these companies include higher costs for materials, labor, and other operational expenses. Inflation can reduce consumers\u2019 purchasing power, decreasing spending on nonessential goods and services. Also, central banks ordinarily respond to high inflation by raising benchmark interest rates. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs for companies, harming their investment and expansion plans. Nonetheless, the effect of inflation can vary within the Magnificent Seven group and depends on the company\u2019s specific business model, cost structure, and market position. The Magnificent Seven stocks represent a cohort of high-performing companies that have garnered significant attention in the investment world for their market dominance, technological advances, and growth potential. These stocks, which include Microsoft, Tesla, and NVIDIA, along with some FAANG members, are known for their influence across various sectors, such as software, hardware, electric vehicles, and artificial intelligence. They have been pivotal in driving technological trends and shaping consumer behavior, making them attractive to investors seeking growth and market leadership. However, investors need to know the risks and challenges associated with these stocks. The dynamic nature of the technology sector, regulatory scrutiny, market saturation, and global economic factors like inflation and geopolitical tensions can affect their performance. Additionally, high market valuations bring lofty expectations, and any failure to meet these can lead to significant stock price corrections. Thus, while the Magnificent Seven offer potential for substantial growth, they also require careful analysis and a balanced approach considering their strengths and the various external factors that could influence their future trajectory.

            "title": "How to Rebalance Your Portfolio",
            "content": "Here's how to build a balanced portfolio to help manage risk and obtain your investing goals Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Like building a house, learning how to rebalance your portfolio begins with creating a sound foundation. First, define your financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. From this assessment, map out a mix of financial assets such as stock and bond ETFs with the help of a financial advisor or robo-advisor or on your own. You\u2019ll typically own a greater percentage of stock assets when you're younger, while more conservative investors will lean towards a larger allotment of cash and bond investments. We\u2019ve compiled the basics every investor should know and have structured this guide for rebalancing your portfolio so that it should answer the most critical questions. The goal in rebalancing your portfolio is not perfection, since as soon as your investments return to their predetermined percentages, prices will shift, causing the asset values to deviate. Rebalance your portfolio at least annually and consider these factors: There are several rebalancing strategies: First, track the asset allocation of your portfolio. You can maintain your records on a spreadsheet or use a free or paid investment monitor like Quicken or Mint. You're ready to proceed when your assets are listed and percent devoted to each asset class is recorded. Compare the current percent weights of each asset class with your predetermined asset allocation. Quicken or other tools can do this for you. Or use a spreadsheet to compare your current asset values with the desired percent. Notice the difference between your actual and preferred asset allocation.\u00a0If your 80% stock, 20% bond portfolio has drifted to 85% stocks and 15% bonds, then it\u2019s time to rebalance, either by adding new money or selling stocks and buying bonds. To sell 5% of your stock assets, you\u2019ll make a simple calculation. Assume your portfolio is worth $100,000 and your desired allocation is $80,000 in stock assets and $20,000 in bond assets. After the value drifts to $85,000 stocks and $15,000 bonds, you\u2019ll sell $5,000 worth of stock investments. With the $5,000 proceeds from the stock sale, you\u2019ll buy $5,000 of bonds. This will return your portfolio to its preferred 80% stock, 20% bond mix. Let\u2019s say that you want to add $10,000 to the portfolio. The value of your portfolio will be $110,000 with a desired asset mix of $88,000 in stock investments and $22,000 in bonds. (Multiply $110,000 by 80% for the stock allocation amount and multiply $110,000 by 20% to arrive at your dollar goal amount for the bond category). To rebalance a portfolio after adding additional cash, calculate the difference between the current value and the preferred value, for each asset class. Using our former example, we have $85,000 in stocks so we buy $3,000 of stocks, to reach the desired $88,000 stock allocation. Similarly, we buy $7,000 of the bond asset class to reach the desired $22,000 in bonds. Follow these steps every time you rebalance your portfolio and don\u2019t worry if the asset allocation drifts between your rebalancing periods. If your situation changes, and you become more conservative or more comfortable with greater volatility or risk, you can always adjust your desired asset allocation. A robo-advisor might be the best solution for those who prefer to outsource portfolio selection and rebalancing. Robo-advisors such as Wealthfront and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios are designed to offer investors access to well-diversified investment portfolios, rebalancing, and other features, such as tax loss harvesting, with low or no management fees. The most popular robo-advisors administer a quick survey to determine your investment goals, timeline, and risk. Ultimately, the survey results drive the investment portfolio. After investing, the top robo-advisors will rebalance your holdings on an as-needed basis, to keep your portfolio in line with the initial survey parameters. Investment management, which includes rebalancing, requires a commitment. You\u2019ll need to analyze your investments, to make certain they still meet your objectives. Periodically you\u2019ll review the asset allocation you\u2019ve selected and decide whether you\u2019re comfortable with the ups and downs of the financial markets. You might choose to increase the stock allocation if you\u2019re comfortable with greater risk, or increase the cash and bond portion if you\u2019re nearing retirement or uncomfortable with occasional double-digit declines in your investment values. Minimizes a portfolio's volatility and risk Improves a portfolio's diversification With a planned rebalancing schedule, you\u2019re less likely to become spooked at a market drop and sell at the bottom Opens the door to reducing portfolio exposure to outperforming sectors or adding to underperforming areas of the market Has the potential for conflict with certain tax loss harvesting strategies Assumes that you\u2019ve chosen your own investments, which requires study and basic financial knowledge Rebalancing is one component of the investment selection and management package. Here are additional tips to aid in successful rebalancing: Remember that investing is a way to turn today's earnings into future financial security.\u00a0Investing and rebalancing are designed to increase your returns over the long term, such as five or more years. For shorter-term goals, consider a certificate of deposit or high-yield money market account. Investors need a mix of higher-return stocks for growth and capital appreciation. But too many individual stocks or stock funds might make your portfolio too volatile. Stocks are more volatile than bonds and might increase 20% in one year and decline that amount or more in another. Bonds deliver lower returns and typically trade in a narrower range with smaller projected gains and losses than stock investments. If you don\u2019t rebalance and restore your assets to the 80% vs. 20% stock/bond mix and stocks become too large a portion of your portfolio, then you might experience a greater loss than you\u2019re comfortable with on occasion. Rebalancing helps your investments stay on track to meet your financial goals. Most investment brokers don\u2019t charge commissions or trading fees for stocks and ETFs. So buying and selling stocks and funds is typically fee-free. If you own individual bonds, you\u2019re apt to pay a commission to buy or sell. Mutual funds might also levy a fee to trade. As long as you\u2019re buying and selling stocks or ETFs, the only fee you might incur is a tax on a capital gain, realized in a taxable brokerage account. Yes, you can rebalance your portfolio without selling. If you\u2019re adding new money into the portfolio, buy the asset class that is underrepresented. If you buy enough shares, you can return the funds or individual holdings back to their preferred asset allocation. If you need to withdraw funds from your account, sell the overrepresented asset. You can also reinvest cash dividend payments into an under-allocated asset class. Rebalancing reduces returns in most cases. Stocks have returned approximately 10% over the last century, so they'll become a greater percentage of the total portfolio over time without rebalancing. Stocks are also riskier and more volatile, so the growing stock allocation of the unbalanced portfolio will lead to higher returns, along with greater volatility. Rebalancing is usually a tradeoff between greater return and lower volatility. Rebalancing too frequently can sacrifice returns. Rebalancing less often can bolster returns and increase portfolio volatility. Vanguard recommends checking your portfolio every six months, and rebalancing if the values drift 5% or more from target. There isn\u2019t a perfect rebalancing solution. The key is to set up a rebalancing schedule that works for you, create a reminder, and stick with it. Rebalancing will keep your preferred asset allocation in check and help to smooth out the volatility of your portfolio. When stock prices soar, rebalancing will force you to take some profits. When prices are lower, and an asset class declines in value, you\u2019ll buy at lower levels. Ultimately, the best way to rebalance is the strategy that works for you. Less frequent rebalancing saves you time and might allow your winning assets to grow for a bit longer.

Nasdaq is positioning the order type for traders with a longer-term investment horizon, not day traders or others looking to move into and out of positions frequently. M-ELO orders execute only against other M-ELO orders at the midpoint of the spread between the bid price and the ask price. Dynamic M-ELO makes a slight change to the standard M-ELO order type. AI analyzes more than 140 data points every 30 seconds to assess market conditions for a security. It then adjusts the waiting period for investors who submit a Dynamic M-ELO order within a range of 0.25 to 2.5 milliseconds, with a jump to 12 milliseconds during market instability. Imagine two traders submitting M-ELO orders. John wants to buy 100 shares of XYZ, and Jane wishes to sell 100 shares of XYZ. If the highest bid for XYZ is $20 and the lowest ask is $21, their M-ELO order will execute at $20.50, the midpoint of the bid-ask spread. The process starts when a buyer enters a M-ELO order to buy a security. After a waiting period of 10 milliseconds, that order becomes eligible to execute against other M-ELO orders. Once a seller arrives, places a M-ELO sell order, and the 10-millisecond waiting period passes, the buyer and seller get matched, and the trade is executed. M-ELO orders can help protect investors from undesired trade executions during market movements. Before the buyer\u2019s trade can execute, if a sell immediate or cancel order sweeps the bids, then the M-ELO order won\u2019t execute. Buyers are also protected if numerous sell orders enter the market and the price of a share drops. The midpoint of the bid-ask spread will also drop, causing the buy price of the M-ELO order to adjust to this level. Hence, M-ELO buyers and sellers will not receive order executions as quickly as someone using an order with no waiting period. However, they are protected from quick market movements because the price of their offer automatically adjusts with the bid-ask spread of the underlying security. AI-powered order types can help investors make more complicated trades or get better prices, but they are not without drawbacks. Here are some of the benefits of AI-powered orders: Here are some downsides of AI-powered order types to consider: Dynamic M-ELO is still a new order type, so it\u2019s difficult to observe its effects on the stock market. However, Nasdaq has released data showing that M-ELO on its own has helped improve order execution. According to Nasdaq, orders using M-ELO had a 50% hit rate, meaning half of all orders received at least one execution, compared with 36% for orders with a holding period of 500 milliseconds. Similarly, the average fill rate was 49% for M-ELO orders compared with 35% for orders with a 500-millisecond holding period. Nasdaq says that by leveraging AI, Dynamic M-ELO can improve trade execution even further, improving fill rates and reducing markouts. The data indicates that it improves fill rates by more than 20% and reduces markouts by more than 11%, according to Nasdaq. Dynamic M-ELO is the first AI-powered order type to be approved by the SEC, but it likely will not be the last. AI is already being used in the world of finance, with many major companies, including Deloitte and BlackRock, integrating AI into their firms\u2019 work. If Dynamic M-ELO proves successful, more AI-powered order types are likely to follow. Further advances in technology could lead to more efficient, agile, and responsive trading systems. They would, in theory, offer better liquidity, reduced trading costs, and improved execution quality. However, their evolution may also pose challenges regarding market fairness, regulation, and systemic risks. AI-powered order types rely on a machine rather than a person to handle order execution. If the AI becomes unresponsive because of a technical issue, it could lead to poor order fulfillment. The AI could also experience errors, leading to buying or selling securities at a subpar price. M-ELO orders allow investors to place buy or sell orders with a short waiting period. These orders only execute against each other and do so at the midpoint of the bid-ask spread. M-ELO orders are ranked in time priority among other M-ELO orders when they complete their waiting period and become eligible for execution. Dynamic M-ELO could be most helpful in volatile market conditions or when trading fewer liquid securities. Its AI-driven algorithms could navigate complex price fluctuations more effectively than traditional order types. While Dynamic M-ELO aims to improve fill rates and reduce markouts, it\u2019s not a guarantee against risks in the market. In addition, the AI algorithms can\u2019t perfectly predict market behavior, and there may be a learning curve for traders new to this order type. Dynamic M-ELO is an AI-powered order type that adjusts the waiting period for a M-ELO order based on market conditions. It is the first AI-powered order type to receive SEC approval, and preliminary data indicates that it could help improve trade execution. If that proves lasting, Dynamic M-ELO is likely to open the doors for future AI-based products that power stock market orders.

            "title": "Index Rebalancing: What Every Investor Should Know",
            "content": "How Index Rebalancing Affects Your Portfolio Adam Hayes, Ph.D., CFA, is a financial writer with 15+ years Wall Street experience as a derivatives trader. Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master's in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology. He is a CFA charterholder as well as holding FINRA Series 7, 55 & 63 licenses. He currently researches and teaches economic sociology and the social studies of finance at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Investopedia / Mira Norian Index rebalancing occurs when an index adjusts the weights of its assets to reflect its purpose. Index rebalancing is the periodic adjustment of an index\u2019s asset weights to ensure it accurately reflects its purpose. An\u00a0index\u00a0is a collection of stocks and other assets representing a financial market segment. Just like a music service occasionally swaps out tracks in its playlists to stay up to date, rebalancing often results in index reconstitution, the sorting, adding, or removing of component stocks. For example, if an index tracks the technology sector,\u00a0rebalancing\u00a0could involve removing companies that have pivoted away from tech and adding newer, up-and-coming tech firms. Alternatively, if the S&P 500 index is to include the 500 largest American stocks, it must periodically add or remove those at the cutoff.  The primary reason for rebalancing an index is to reflect an accurate collection of securities, and a proper weighting for each security, to maintain the stated objectives of the index. Over time, companies can grow, shrink, or change their business focus. If an index remains static, the weighting of its components may become overly skewed towards the best-performing stocks and not sufficiently representative of the worst-performing stocks. That means it risks becoming an outdated snapshot that no longer corresponds to existing market conditions and therefore no longer represents the intended market segment. Rebalancing refreshes the index, ensuring it remains a timely and suitable tool for investors. Indexes often serve as\u00a0benchmarks\u00a0for investment products like mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If an index becomes overly concentrated\u2014say, if one sector or a few large companies begin to dominate\u2014this could expose investors to higher risks. Rebalancing redistributes weights across diverse assets, keeping a balanced risk profile. Rebalancing ensures an index adapts to economic and sector shifts. For example, in its March 2024 rebalancing, the S&P 500 added Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Deckers Outdoor (DECK) to the index, replacing Whirlpool (WHR) and Zion Bancorporation (ZION). Index rebalancing involves an initial review of assets, setting criteria based on market conditions, and making subsequent adjustments to asset weights, sometimes leading to the addition or removal of specific assets. Understanding how index rebalancing is done can demystify this essential process and its effects on your investments and the market at large. Let's dive into the steps involved in index rebalancing: the initial review, reviewing the inclusion criteria for the index, selecting in and out particular assets, weighting, and implementation. The S&P 500 is a widely followed index of 500 large-cap U.S. stocks that represents the most commonly used performance benchmark of large-cap companies in the U.S. stock market. S&P Dow Jones Indices maintains the index and selects which companies are included based on criteria like market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability, and sector representation. The S&P 500 is rebalanced quarterly, usually on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. However, changes can also occur intra-quarter if a company becomes ineligible after a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or delisting. During an S&P 500 rebalance, the weights of the different shares in the index are adjusted to reflect their latest share counts and\u00a0float. During the rebalance, companies may be added or removed based on the eligibility criteria. An immediate and visible impact of index rebalancing is increased trading activity. Institutional and retail investors react as index providers announce the stocks to be added or removed from an index. For example, asset managers who run index funds\u00a0or\u00a0index ETFs must scramble to adjust their portfolios to match the new index composition, increasing the trading of specific stocks. This surge in trading can be significant, and it's often seen as a short-term opportunity for traders specializing in arbitrage. An increase in trading activity often leads to\u00a0volatility for the stocks involved in the rebalancing. Shares newly added to an index often have a price boost as index-following funds buy them. Conversely, those being removed may dip in price as they are sold off. While these price changes are generally temporary, they can present challenges and opportunities for active investors. Rebalancing can also generate sector shifts in the market. For example, if an index adds technology stocks and removes those from the energy sector, it can drive up demand for tech stocks while reducing the appetite for energy shares. Although only connected to the index initially, these shifts can extend to the broader market, influencing sector-based funds and individual stock performance. When a company is added to a prestigious index like the S&P 500, it's seen as a vote of confidence that can positively impact investor sentiment toward that company. Similarly, removal from an index is seen as a negative indicator. For those who invest in index funds or ETFs that aim to replicate the performance of a particular index, rebalancing can lead them to adjust their portfolios. When an index is rebalanced, the index fund or ETF that tracks it will modify its holdings to match the new composition. As an investor, you\u2019ll see shifts in your asset allocation, which might dictate reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio to ensure it still aligns with your financial goals. For long-term investors, the implications of rebalancing might not be immediately apparent, though they could become significant over time. If an index continually shifts its focus\u2014say, from value-oriented companies to growth-oriented ones\u2014it may no longer serve as a suitable benchmark for your investment strategy. In these cases, you might reconsider your investment choices and look for alternative index-tracking funds that better match your long-term goals. The announcement of index rebalancing can also present short-term trading opportunities. Stocks added to an index often have a temporary price boost based on increased buying activity, while those being removed may dip in price. Savvy investors can leverage these fluctuations for short-term gains, although it\u2019s essential to approach this strategy with caution and thorough analysis. When an index fund or ETF adjusts its portfolio, this may result in capital gains or losses. These are often passed to investors, who must report them on their tax returns. Understanding the tax consequences of index rebalancing can help you take steps to mitigate your tax burden. The frequency of index rebalancing depends on the index in question. Some indexes, like the S&P 500, are rebalanced quarterly, while others are adjusted semiannually or annually. Specialized or thematic indexes might have unique rebalancing schedules. A rebalancing may also occur between scheduled evaluations because of rapid changes in the market. Knowing the rebalancing schedule of the index you\u2019re interested in is crucial, as this will affect your investment strategy. Market-cap-weighted indexes like the S&P 500 must undergo regular review and rebalancing to ensure that market capitalization weights are aligned with their underlying stocks or that specific sector weights are in line. Alternatively, price-weighted indexes like the\u00a0Dow Jones Industrial Average are more influenced by the stock prices of their components than their market capitalization. As a result, these indexes might rebalance less frequently, typically when a stock undergoes a split or when one company is replaced by another. In rare circumstances, you might encounter indexes that do not undergo rebalancing at all. These are usually historical or for academic purposes and are not generally used for active investments or benchmarking. They serve more as a snapshot of the market at a particular time and are not designed to represent current conditions. Rebalancing has mixed effects on individual stocks and is often neutral for ordinary investors. Being added to an index can boost a stock's price and liquidity because of increased demand, which is often seen as a positive development. Conversely, being removed from an index can lead to a price decline and be perceived negatively. However, these effects are generally short-term and often balance out over time. Index rebalancing refers to adjusting the components of a market index, like the S&P 500, while\u00a0portfolio rebalancing is an action by individual investors to realign their portfolios with their investment goals. While index rebalancing can require portfolio rebalancing, they are distinct and serve different objectives. Understanding index rebalancing can arm you with the knowledge to improve how you navigate the investment landscape. Whether you're an individual investor or studying finance, knowing how and why indexes are rebalanced can help you make more informed decisions that align with your financial goals.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn the importance of ESG and how you can invest in it d3sign / Getty Images Growing climate concerns and social injustice have more investors wondering about how to invest in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) funds and stocks. The idea behind ESG investing is to make a difference with the dollars you invest by supporting companies that demonstrate policies congruent with improving the environment, positive social justice, and furthering sound governance. If you want to grow your wealth while creating a more just world, then you need to understand ESG in investing. Find out how to invest in ESG, from opening a brokerage account to researching ESG investments. This article will cover a range of ESG investments and strategies so that you can align your money with your values. How to incorporate ESG factors in investing is straightforward. With accessible ESG screeners as well as funds dedicated to this investment approach, ESG investing is as easy as selecting a few screening parameters and searching through a database for the sustainable investments that fit your needs. To begin your ESG investing journey, you\u2019ll need to choose an investment platform, typically an online brokerage account. After opening and funding the account, you\u2019ll visit the research section of the platform to screen for your ESG investments. Next, pick the assets that fit your criteria and proceed to buy shares in the stock, bond, or fund. Here\u2019s how it works. Step 1: Open an Online Brokerage Account Step 2: Understand Your ESG Criteria ESG factors encompass a range of criteria spanning the environment, societal issues, and sound government. ESG funds can be broad and include a range of companies that fit into a broad environmental, social or governance framework. Other ESG assets may focus on components of ESG investing, such as lowering carbon emissions, improving worker equity, gender diversity, minority empowerment, greater board diversity, investing in green projects, and ethical labor management. Most screeners assign a company an ESG score. The score includes how well the company fits within widely accepted ESG criteria and typically consists of a five point scale from one to five. Before screening to find the best ESG companies to invest in, determine the lowest ESG score you\u2019ll accept. Finally, decide whether you\u2019re seeking a broad or targeted ESG fund, or prefer screening for individual ESG companies. Step 3: Research ESG Investments Next decide among two ESG investing approaches. With the self-directed investing route, you screen for and select your preferred ESG investments. Or, if you\u2019d like to outsource your ESG investing, you might consider a robo-advisor that offers ESG investments. Robo-advisors are low-fee investment managers that offer various core and strategy portfolios in line with your goals and risk tolerance levels. Step 4: Choose an ESG Investment After you\u2019ve selected your ESG investments, you\u2019re ready to proceed. The final step in how to invest in ESG companies or funds is simply placing a trade on your brokerage platform app or desktop. While on the screen for the ESG investment there is usually a button labeled \u201cTrade.\u201d Or you can select the website\u2019s \u201cTrade\u201d menu item. Once on the trade screen, you\u2019ll follow these simple steps: The Orders page of the platform will show the details of the trade and whether it has been filled or not. Once the order is filled, money will be transferred from your cash balance to fund the new ESG stock or fund purchase. Opening an online brokerage account is as easy as following the online prompts. Click on the button that says \u201cstart here\u201d or \u201copen an account.\u201d Next, provide the personal and financial information listed below. After this, you simply link a funding source (usually a bank account) and you\u2019re ready to begin your ESG investing journey. The brokerage industry follows the highest security and compliance levels when dealing with your money and investing activities. All personal information requested is required by law to ensure that you are who you claim to be and is protected by the company. Here is the personal information that you\u2019ll typically need to open an online brokerage account: Investment brokers are closely regulated and must ensure your suitability for the various investment products that the firm offers. When opening your investment account you\u2019ll need to provide financial information as part of the know your client standard, including: ESG investing is a strategy to ferret out companies that meet specific environmental, social, and good governance parameters. Here\u2019s an example of the factors that are considered in each of the ESG or sustainable investing categories: The growth in ESG investing is driven by a broad desire for a more just society. ESG investors hope that by investing in sustainable companies, capital will flow into companies that meet the ESG standards and thus further a healthier planet and more compassionate corporate society. An ESG score is a quantifiable determinant of a company\u2019s rank on a range of environmental, social, and governance issues. Various organizations calculate and attempt to standardize ESG scores. ESG scores are based on information from securities filings, corporate disclosures, government databases, academic studies, media reports, and more. Screeners typically assign companies and funds an ESG score between one and five. When searching for ESG investments, select your preferred ESG score. Scores will vary by industry and reporting agency, and like any published metric, should be considered as one of several inputs into an investment decision. Wondering why to invest in ESG? The reasons vary and include the potential personal, financial, and societal benefits. Ranking companies by ESG criteria provides a rubric that enables governments, businesses, and individuals to work together to progress on societal and global issues. ESG investing benefits include: With the popularity of sustainable ESG investing, there are many ESG investments available. Self-directed investors can screen for ESG funds and individual companies. hose who prefer robo-advisors or managed portfolios have many choices as well. Types of ESG investments: ESG investing remains a strategy to build long-term wealth. Sustainable investors should consider ESG scores along with the traditional investment selection strategies. These might include fundamental analysis for stock picking, meaning ESG ratings are a metric along with debt-to-equity ratios and earnings-per-share. For fund selection, it\u2019s wise to review expense ratios, performance metrics, and the stated investment strategy. Begin your search for ESG investments by choosing a platform with robust investment selection and screening. This might be your financial firm like Schwab or Fidelity. Research sites such as Morningstar can also provide useful ESG investment research information. Next, you will select the screening factors, both ESG and traditional. Following are factors to consider when investing in ESG: ESG companies meet one or more of the widely accepted environmental, social, or governance criteria. Depending upon the ESG certification platform, the company will receive a specific score that is based upon the rating criteria. It is important to dig into the criteria to understand how companies are being evaluated and avoid greenwashing. Various ESG tracking organizations provide lists of ESG companies. You won\u2019t find tobacco companies on an ESG company list due to the health risks of smoking. Companies who make firearms are also usually omitted. A quick internet search will yield multiple lists of ESG companies to use as a springboard for your ESG company research. There are a few fund families dedicated solely to ESG investing such as Pax World Funds and Calvert Group. That said, the majority of ESG funds are created by popular fund families like iShares or Vanguard. A quick Morningstar ETF search of ESG funds with a 4 or 5 ranking (out of 5) yielded 640 offerings. From that list, you can screen for the ESG criteria that matter most to you. If you\u2019re seeking an ESG fund that focuses on gender diversity, you might like SPDR\u00ae MSCI USA Gender Diversity ETF (SHE). If you\u2019re seeking a diversified U.S. or international ESG equity fund, there are scores from which to choose such as iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU) or Calvert International Responsible Index Fund (A) (CDHAX). Unfortunately, there is not any list of best ESG funds that is universally agreed upon. The results are inconclusive. A recent Harvard Business Review article included research from Columbia University and the London School of Economics that compared the ESG record of 147 U.S. companies found in ESG portfolios with 2,428 U.S. companies found in non-ESG portfolios. The surprising finding was that the companies in the ESG portfolios had worse compliance records for labor and environmental metrics. This study also determined that those companies added to ESG portfolios didn\u2019t improve the companies\u2019 labor or environmental compliance. Adding to the confusion, there is no universally accepted definition or ESG scoring method. Performance of ESG funds has been comparable with their non-ESG competitors. It remains to be seen whether ESG investing actually helps companies comply with standard global ESG initiatives or not. ESG investing relates to ethical behavior and ascribes to the common good theory, which encourages citizens to sacrifice for the good of society. ESG strives to further ethical behavior, such as caring for the earth, treating all individuals fairly, and righting societal injustices. It\u2019s difficult to definitively determine whether ESG investing is furthering ethical behavior and creates a better society. That said, as a society, it is ethical to encourage companies to transact their businesses in a way that is beneficial to society. In that light, ESG investing is focused on the higher societal goals and therefore ESG investing is generally considered ethical.

Learn how to invest in AI and capitalize on the future Xavier Lorenzo / Getty Images Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept\u2014it's a transformative force reshaping industries and everyday life. Before investing in AI, it\u2019s useful to understand what artificial intelligence is; AI technology infuses computers and tech products with human-like intelligence and problem-solving abilities. From virtual assistants in our homes to autonomous vehicles on our roads, AI is quickly being added to many products and applications, dominating discussions of investments and questions about the future. The AI landscape is complex and news of added capabilities at one firm reshuffles the pace of change at all of them. Choosing the best AI companies to invest in is a tricky endeavor\u2014even if you're using the best online brokers and trading platforms. Just as investors half a generation ago had to separate the wheat from the chaff among web browser, smartphone, and app-based startups, so too are niche players and established tech giants now vying for AI market share and research capital. In this article, we explore how to invest in AI and showcase the best AI stocks and funds. Like past emerging technologies, such as railroads in the late 1800s or the personal computer in the 1980s, there are many ways to invest in AI. While some companies will have wild success, other early companies will fail. The computer revolution is an apt analogy for AI investing and how to invest in AI. Computers set the stage for automating mundane and repeatable tasks, and now AI seeks to advance this concept by automating tasks that previously required human intelligence. Investors can find some top AI stocks have one-year returns in the high double digits, with NVIDIA reporting 176% 12-month growth as of July 23, 2024. Some people want to invest directly in companies that develop AI, while others might invest in those companies that stand to benefit the most from its wider adoption. Using the introduction and growth of the personal computer industry as an example, some investors successfully invested in computer manufacturers or hardware companies that made routers and switches. Others invested in software companies that produced computer programs, while others attempted to identify companies that would benefit most from the automation that computers offered. Some of these investments were direct bets on computers and the actual technology, while others were more conservative, such as buying shares in already strong companies that stood to benefit from the growth of computer usage. The point is that there are various ways to invest in a new technology. Sometimes, one firm takes and holds a market-leading position, but other times, an imitator can use the first company's technology better, making it more successful over time. Since it\u2019s tough to pick the winning AI stocks in advance, owning several or selecting an AI ETF could minimize making a wrong move. While these are among the top AI stocks, consider the business cycle and valuations before going all in. You might want to incorporate a dollar cost average into your AI stock picks as a hedge against a market drop. Investing in professionally managed ETFs or mutual funds that hold shares in AI companies allows you to leave it to a fund's professional managers to research and pick suitable AI companies. Through an ETF, you own a share of a portfolio of multiple AI stocks within a single investment. Buying individual AI stocks is more work for the investor. Given the multiple ways to invest in AI, the first step is to read about the industry to understand the various aspects of artificial intelligence. Within the AI universe, there are pure plays and more conservative plays, and you'll have to decide the type of exposure you want in this market sector. Once you have an idea of the parts of the AI market you want to invest in, you can perform traditional investment analyses\u2014both fundamental and technical. AI is exploding, and the technology behind it appears poised to break out further and deliver on expectations for more widespread adoption across a wide range of businesses and real-world applications. Like any technology that requires massive capital investment, AI offers plenty of opportunities for investors to make money, but new technologies also involve risk. You'll want to determine the best way to gain exposure without involving risk beyond your tolerance. Choices include more speculative direct AI investments in individual companies or ETFs and mutual funds that offer a portfolio of multiple companies in the AI space. You can also look to invest in companies that are positioned to increase their revenues as AI is more widely adopted across the economy. Generative AI use for images is among its most popular applications. Users can type or speak of an image they want to create, and an AI program can produce an image that meets that description\u2014most of the time. These AI programs use the user\u2019s description with images available worldwide to generate the image for the user requesting the artwork. People of all ages and backgrounds have utilized AI-generated artwork. Once you\u2019ve created AI art, you can sell it and/or buy from others on AI art marketplaces. Art made with AI can be collected as giclee prints, digital downloads, NFTs, and other formats. It can be bought and sold on some crypto platforms and designated AI art websites. However, the profit and investment potential for AI art is still in its infancy and cannot be accurately ascertained. Startup companies are often created in new and promising fields, such as AI and machine learning. Often, these are companies that have been initially capitalized by venture capital investors, then taken public to capitalize on their initial investment and to raise more capital as the business increases its operations and begins offering its products to a wider customer base. Many startup investments are only available to large accredited investors. Other websites enable the public to invest small amounts in promising new ventures. You\u2019ll need to sift through the offerings to uncover the AI startup companies. While investing in startups can be risky, the rewards for investing in a successful startup company can be huge. Examples of successful startup companies include Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Yes, you can directly invest in AI and machine learning by investing in individual stocks or in ETFs or mutual funds that focus on AI stocks. Conservative investors wondering which AI stocks to buy might consider established companies that are benefiting from AI processes, while aggressive investors can seek out investments in direct AI companies. For AI investing ideas, check out the best AI stocks. This list is updated monthly. Investing in AI in 2024 offers compelling prospects for your portfolio. The technology continues to seep into the media, healthcare, automotive, finance, and other sectors. However, you'll have to navigate challenges that could include potential legal and regulatory changes, supply shortages, and the broader political and ethical considerations concerning the widespread deployment of AI systems and the ecological effects of powering them. Similar to investing in the new internet and computing industries decades ago, the winners and losers can change on a dime. Staying informed and selectively investing in companies prioritizing robust business models will be crucial for those looking to capitalize on the AI boom while mitigating risks.

Learn what it takes to buy fractional shares on Webull ArtistGNDphotography / Getty Images If you are looking to start investing in the market but don\u2019t feel like you have enough money to buy enough shares to fully diversify your portfolio, fractional shares are a great solution. This strategy allows you to invest in stocks based on a specific dollar amount rather than buying a specific number of shares. This allows you to diversify your funds and start investing at a lower threshold. Buying fractional shares on Webull\u2019s platform is streamlined and easy. You simply open and fund an account to access fractional shares from an approved list of thousands of stocks and ETFs. We\u2019ll take an in-depth look at how to buy fractional shares through Webull and cover the basics to help you decide if fractional share trading is the right fit for your portfolio needs. Buying fractional shares on Webull is a very simple process. To open an account, you have to provide some basic personal information as well as details on your employment, financial status, and what type of securities you want to invest in. Once the application has been filled out, most investors will receive an email with account approval within minutes. Once the account has been approved, you merely need to fund the account and you will be ready to start investing. Step 1: Open a Webull account. Opening an account with Webull is straightforward. Users can sign up using their phone number and verification code, or sign up using their Facebook or Google profile. You will then have the option to select \u201copen an account.\u201d Next you will be asked to verify your identity by uploading a photo of your driver\u2019s license or another form of identification. From there, you will enter in your basic personal information, employment information, financial information, and the type of account you want to open. Once all this is filled out, you will enter your email address for verification of account application approval. When you receive the email letting you know your account is approved, you are ready to fund your account and start investing. You can fund the account via an ACH transfer with a linked bank account using the \u201cmake your first deposit\u201d button. It is important to note that you can choose between a cash account and a margin account. With the cash account, you can purchase stocks with whatever funds you deposit. A margin account requires an account balance above $2,000 and unlocks the ability to use leverage beyond your balance to increase your buying power. Step 2: Log in to your Webull account. Once you have opened a Webull account, you can login and search for the stock or exchange traded fund (ETF) that you\u2019d like to buy fractional shares of. If fractional share trading is available for that particular stock, there will be a green diamond icon on the stock. Step 3: Click the \u201cTrade\u201d tab. After deciding on the stock that you\u2019d like to buy and determining that it can be traded in fractional shares, you will click the \u201ctrade\u201d button at the bottom of your screen. From there, switch the order type to \u201cmarket,\u201d as fractional share trading at Webull can only take place currently as a market order during market hours. Step 4: Change setting from \u201cShares\u201d to \u201cDollars.\u201d You will then need to change the setting from \u201cshare\u201d to \u201cUSD\u201d in order to buy fractional shares. Enter the dollar amount that you\u2019d like to invest and review all order information for accuracy. Step 5: Submit your order. Once you have verified your order information, click the \u201cbuy\u201d button at the bottom of the screen to place your order. You will want to carefully review your order before clicking the \u201cbuy\u201d button because once an order is placed, Webull does not have the option to modify an open order. To open your new account at Webull, you will need to provide your basic personal and financial information. When opening your account online, you will be asked to provide personal and contact information: In addition to providing your personal information, you will be asked to provide your employment and basic financial information. After your account application has been approved, you will then have the option to fund your account via ACH transfer from your current U.S. bank account or wire transfer from U.S. or foreign banks (fees may apply for wire transfers). Unlike a full service brokerage, Webull does not ask you about your financial goals or long-term financial planning. The platform currently offered is transactional in nature only. If you are looking for a low-cost, no-commission platform that is easy to use for placing trades, Webull is a good option. However, if you are looking for a more comprehensive platform\u2013offering account consolidation, goal planning, or research\u2013you may need to look elsewhere. The most obvious benefit of opening an account and trading fractional shares at Webull is the speed of the process. You can literally open an account within minutes and start trading. Webull offers thousands of U.S. stocks and ETFs for fractional share trading. However, you can really only determine which stocks and ETFs are currently on the list by searching in your account dashboard and seeing if the green diamond icon that indicates fractional share availability is by the stock or ETF. In terms of the quality of the trading platform, Webull offers a decent selection of charting tools and a basic stock screener. Webull may not be as full-featured as larger brokers, but for a streamlined, no-fee brokerage, it is more than adequate for fundamental stock research and basic technical analysis. Webull also offers access to other assets, including options that will appeal to more active traders. Another differentiating factor is that Webull offers margin trading. Because of the volatility of the market and the fact that trading on margin is actually borrowing money from Webull that you must pay back with interest, this option may be best suited for a more seasoned investor. It is important to remember that when investing using a margin account that you will still have to pay back the original amount borrowed plus interest even if the stocks lose value. All that said, buying fractional shares with a cash account is quick and easy, and funding your Webull account can be done via either ACH funds transfer or wire transfer. Selection of stocks and ETFs available for fractional share investing: Webull offers thousands of stocks and ETFs for fractional share investing. However, in order to find which stocks or ETFs are approved, you must search the specific stock from your Webull account dashboard and look for the green diamond icon to determine if the stock can be traded in fractional shares or not. Fees and commissions: Getting started at Webull is simple with $0 commissions for online U.S. stock and ETF trades. There are also no account management fees or inactivity fees to buy and sell fractional shares. Account minimums: Investors at Webull can buy fractional shares for as low as $5; there is no minimum to open an account. Research amenities: Once you open an account with Webull, you will have access to limited research amenities from your account dashboard. Investors can go to the \u201cmarkets\u201d tab and search any stock or ETF to see the current market price and basic information. The \u201cnews\u201d tab is another resource that compiles articles from multiple sources across the internet on trending financial topics. Educational content: The educational content provided by Webull is basic information on how to invest, what investment products the brokerage offers, and how to use the Webull app. Investors can access this library of videos from the \u201clearn\u201d tab. Fractional shares allow investors to buy a fraction, or portion, of a whole share of a stock. Investing in fractional shares helps you to easily diversify your portfolio and invest in companies that you may otherwise not be able to easily buy shares of. For instance, if you want to invest in a company, but the stock price is $100 per share, you don\u2019t need to have $100 to buy a full share. At Webull, you can invest in this company for as little as $5. In this case, your stake in the company will be 0.05 of a full share (5/100). With this strategy, you are investing based on a specific dollar amount that you set, not an individual stock\u2019s price or a certain number of shares. Buying fractional shares provides investors with a lower entry point of accessibility, thereby allowing themto gain market entry sooner into expensive stocks. Moreover, with fractional shares of ETFs, investors can diversify their portfolio at smaller account values than would otherwise be possible. Webull, founded in 2017, is a Chinese-owned company headquartered in New York. Webull is a discount broker that offers limited services and a straightforward, no-frills platform. Offering commission-free trades, no fees, and no account minimum requirements, Webull has positioned itself to serve newer and more active traders. Currently, the company offers standard brokerage accounts, which provide the choice to invest in: Fractional share trading is currently offered on thousands of stocks and ETFs at Webull, but it is only available for the latest version of the mobile app. Keep in mind that only stocks and ETFs from an approved list are available for fractional share trading, so while you may want to invest in options or crypto, that cannot be done fractionally at this time. Investing in fractional shares is a good way to dollar-cost average your money into the market. When utilizing this strategy on a regular basis, you will be buying fractions of several stocks over the course of time, which will accumulate into a portfolio that includes full shares of multiple stocks. Buying shares of a stock over time reduces the effect of market timing where you may be paying a premium or getting a discount on a transaction based on market factors. Lowering the total cost paid for an asset can make you money, provided that the asset appreciates over time. Over time, diversified portfolios are more likely than not to appreciate. Webull is not the only option when it comes to fractional share trading. Charles Schwab is an excellent online platform to buy fractional shares of stocks. Investors can choose from any stock listed on the approved list of S&P 500 stocks for an investment as low as $5. Schwab also allows investors to choose up to 30 \u201cslices\u201d each time they place an order, so diversifying your portfolio is quite easy to do. As many options as investors have when buying fractional shares at Charles Schwab, ETFs are one product that is not currently available. Webull offers fractional shares on select ETFs, as do other Schwab competitors like Fidelity. Not owning a full share of a company can make it more complicated when you want to sell it. Webull offers investors fractional share trading as market orders only. When selling, there is a minimum of 0.00001 shares per order for closing fractional share positions. It is also noted on the website that \u201cthe rule of $5 minimum doesn't work for closing fractional share positions.\u201d Fractional shares are not able to be transferred, so any fractional share would need to be sold prior to a transfer taking place.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Luis Alvarez / Getty Images One of the basic tenets of investing is to diversify your portfolio in order to hedge against market risk. This can be hard to do if you are just starting out or have a limited amount of money to invest. However, investing in fractional shares through online brokers opens up opportunities to purchase portions of higher-priced stocks with the money you have on hand. We\u2019ll take a deep dive into how investing in fractional shares works at Fidelity and answer the basic questions needed to help you decide if this approach is right for you. Buying fractional shares at Fidelity is quite simple. Investors have access to more than 7,000 U.S. stocks and ETFs for fractional share trading. Fidelity offers several types of accounts that investors can use to buy fractional shares and makes it easy to start investing with low fees and low minimum investment requirements. Opening an online account at Fidelity is quick and easy. You will need to provide your basic personal information and select the type of account that you want to open. Once you have opened an account with Fidelity, you will need to log in and fund your account. Remember, fractional share trading takes place in real-time, so the funds will need to be settled and available in your account in order to place a trade. The \u201ctrade\u201d tab is at the top left of your Fidelity dashboard. Once you click on \u201ctrade,\u201d a dropdown menu will open with a form to fill out regarding what type of trade you\u2019d like to make. By selecting the \u201cDollars\u201d setting, you will be able to buy fractional shares. This will base your order on a specific dollar amount, instead of buying a specific number of shares. Dollar amounts can be entered out to two decimal places, for example, $50.75. The order is then converted into shares out to three decimal places and rounded down to the nearest decimal. Fractional share orders are entered as market orders or limit orders and are only good for the day. At the bottom of the trading form, you will then click \u201cPreview order.\u201d This will lead to a confirmation screen where you can edit, cancel, or place the order. Fractional share trading is done in real-time, during market hours, so you will know your share price. Below is a comparison of Fidelity with other brokers. To open your new account at Fidelity, you will need to provide your basic personal and financial information. You can also choose the type of account that you\u2019d like to open, depending on your financial investing needs and goals. The following Fidelity retail accounts are approved for buying fractional shares: When opening your account online, you will be asked to provide personal and contact information: Besides providing your personal information, you will be asked to provide your financial information. This will include particulars regarding your current financial situation, as well as your investing goals. These are the \u201cknow your client\u201d questions that Fidelity must ask to ensure you\u2019re being matched to investments that are appropriate for your financial situation and risk tolerance. As part of this process, you may even choose to link your current bank account or use mobile deposit in order to fund your Fidelity account more quickly. That said, sending a check in the mail is also an option. There are several benefits of opening an account and trading fractional shares at Fidelity: One of the key benefits of investing with Fidelity is that it offers over 7,000 U.S. stocks and ETFs for fractional share trading. Some brokers only offer a handful of stocks to choose from for this type of investing, so Fidelity gives you a larger chunk of the market to work with. Fidelity has long been recognized as a leader in the industry for its low-cost fees and for delivering value to customers. Fidelity has continued to improve and offers new products to investors as markets have developed. Fidelity has introduced exposure to crypto and digital payments, in addition to stocks, bonds, ETFs, and fractional share trading. Fidelity does all this through a user-friendly desktop platform and mobile experience for investors, and effectively uses dashboards to make it easier for investors to keep up-to-date on their accounts and their progress towards financial goals. Fractional shares may complicate tax reporting, as each sale can trigger taxable events based on share allocations. Fidelity has a wide selection of stock and ETF offerings for fractional share investing, making over 7,000 shares available for dollar-cost averaging via fractional shares. One unique product that Fidelity offers is FidFolios, which enables investors to construct their own customized index of stocks and ETFs. Getting started at Fidelity is made simple with $0 commissions for online U.S. stock and ETF trades. There are also no account fees or minimums to open a retail brokerage account. Investors at Fidelity can buy fractional shares for as low as $1 and there is no minimum to open a self-managed investment account. Investing in Fidelity Managed FidFolios does require a $5,000 minimum, though. Once you open an account with Fidelity, you will have access to research amenities right from your account dashboard. Investors can access a plethora of research and news from the \u201cNews & Research\u201d tab at the top of the dashboard, with a dropdown menu offering information on the latest news, watch lists, quotes, alerts, and much more. Knowing how to invest, what to invest in, and how to reach your financial goals are important, and the educational content provided by Fidelity can help you do just that. Investors can utilize the \u201cPlanning & Advice\u201d tab on their dashboard to become more informed investors. Investors can find articles and information on topics ranging from investing basics to long-term care planning. Account users will also find it easy to access information regarding stocks, mutual funds, or ETFs in which they would like to invest, as well as other investment vehicles. Investing in fractional shares helps you to easily diversify your portfolio and invest in companies that you may otherwise not be able to afford. Fractional shares\u2014or \u201cStocks by the Slice,\u201d as Fidelity calls them\u2014allow investors to buy a fraction of a whole share of a stock. With this strategy, you are investing based on a dollar amount, not an individual stock\u2019s price or a certain number of shares. Buying fractional shares provides investors with a lower entry point of accessibility, thereby allowing investors to gain market entry sooner. It also allows you to employ dollar-cost averaging across a basket of larger stocks that you would otherwise have to save up to slowly accumulate shares. The ability to dollar-cost average into an ETF, for example, gives smaller investors the same advantages that large-scale investors enjoy in terms of diversification. Fidelity is the largest U.S. brokerage, was founded in 1943, and is headquartered in Boston. The company has $15 trillion in assets under administration and $5.8 trillion in discretionary assets. Fidelity has been able to use its economies of scale to continue to offer competitive products and services while maintaining a low-fee structure for clients. Although it is undoubtedly a large, traditional brokerage, Fidelity has been able to remain at the forefront of the industry by embracing technology and launching new products and services including digital investment management, crypto and digital payments, Active Trader Pro, and the Fidelity Metaverse. As with any investment, fractional shares have the potential to both make and lose money, depending on the market performance of the asset you are investing in. Investing in fractional shares is a good way to dollar-cost average your money into the market. If you are investing on a regular basis, you will be buying \u201cslices\u201d of several stocks over time. This will not only allow you to take advantage of dips in the market when buying but over time, will enable you to build a portfolio that consists of full shares of multiple stocks. The key difference is that this portfolio will be diversified throughout the whole accumulation stage rather than only growing in diversification as your account balance grows. Yes, Fidelity offers ETFs as fractional shares. Fidelity offers investors over 7,000 choices of individual stocks and ETFs to buy as fractional shares. Fidelity also offers FidFolios, which allows you to create your own customized index of stocks and ETFs. This specialized product does require a $5,000 minimum investment, though. However, you can start investing in fractional shares of individual stocks and ETFs for just $1. Fidelity offers investors real-time trading during market hours. It is possible that fractional shares for certain securities may not be liquid and National Financial Services (NFS), which acts in a mixed capacity (as principal for the fractional share components and as agent for the whole share components) will not be able to guarantee a market for the security. Fractional shares are also not able to be transferred, so any fractional share would need to be sold prior to a transfer taking place. On the whole, however, fractional shares of larger, liquid stocks are just as easy to sell as their whole counterparts. Investing in fractional shares through platforms like Fidelity offers a practical way for investors with limited funds to diversify their portfolios. The process is simple and involves opening an account, funding it, and placing trades based on dollar amounts. While fractional shares provide easier market entry, they come with certain limitations, such as liquidity issues and non-transferability; however, Fidelity's user-friendly platform, low fees, and educational resources make it a strong choice for beginners looking to diversify their investments.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn the various ways to buy fractional shares ArtistGNDphotography / Getty Imagea If you\u2019ve ever wanted to invest in a particular company\u2019s stock, but didn\u2019t have enough money to buy even one share, or you want to effectively diversify your funds, investing in fractional shares through online brokers or robo-advisors might be an affordable way to get started. Fractional shares allow investors to buy a portion, or fraction, of a stock based on a dollar amount that the investor can afford\u2013not based on a particular number of shares. Implementing this type of strategy is propitious for investors who may be starting out with a limited amount of money, but still want to build a diversified portfolio. We\u2019ll take an in-depth look at how investing in fractional shares works and answer the basic questions that investors need to know to get started. In order to buy fractional shares, you will need to open an investment account through either an online broker or a robo-advisor. The main difference between the two is whether you want to have full control over which fractional shares you are investing in, or if you want to have a more hands-off approach. With a robo-advisor, you will be able to set your dollar amount to invest and your investment goals, and based on that, the robo-advisor will choose your fractional share investments and automatically rebalance to keep you within your investment goal range. Step 1: Research the fractional shares you want to buy. Fractional share offerings will differ between brokerages, so knowing which stocks you want to be able to invest in via fractional shares can also help determine which brokerage you may want to use. Step 2: Open an online broker or robo-advisor account. Not all online brokers or robo-advisors offer fractional shares, so you will need to make sure the company you want to go with offers that service. It is also important to remember that every brokerage has slightly different nuances to the way they offer fractional shares, such as: Step 3: Fund the account. You will need to fund the account once you open it. Many online brokers can be funded via electronic funds transfer, but it still may take a few days for the funds to settle, so you may not be able to invest right away. Step 4: Complete and monitor your investment. Most online accounts make it very easy to monitor your portfolio using the main dashboard. Typically, you are able to see all of your account holdings at a glance, but you may also be able to utilize more advanced options, such as setting up stock alerts or automatic rebalancing, depending on what is offered by your particular online brokerage. While there are several benefits to investing in fractional shares, the following drawbacks are also worth considering: Limited stock selection: Just because a stock is publicly traded does not mean that you will be able to buy fractional shares of it. Each brokerage has its own curated list of stocks that investors can buy fractional shares of. Potential problems transferring fractional shares to a different broker: If you want to transfer your account to another brokerage, you may not be able to transfer the fractional shares. You may need to liquidate any fractional shares in order to transfer. Proxy voting may not be an option: Again, each firm also handles proxy voting differently regarding fractional shares. Make sure you know your company\u2019s policy on this ahead of time. Additional fees: Some brokerages charge additional fees for fractional share investing. This can potentially decrease profits, especially for low-dollar investment amounts. Find out if there are fees associated with fractional shares and if they are flat fees or a percentage. Trade execution may not take place in real time: If the brokerage that you are investing with does not settle your trade in real time, that could affect your cost basis. Some firms will settle all the fractional shares in one or more bulk orders rather than settling each order individually. Obviously, prices can fluctuate throughout a trading day, so understanding how this will be settled is important. Can complicate tax returns: Because you are buying fractional shares, and may buy several fractional shares throughout the year, depending on your investment strategy, you may end up holding several different tax lots that may be difficult to match up at tax time. If a stock you own has a dividend that you automatically reinvest, you will have additional tax lots to deal with. Selection of stocks and ETFs available for fractional share investing: Because each online brokerage has its own select list of stocks or ETFs that they offer for fractional share investing, it is important to know this ahead of time. Some firms will offer ETFs, others will not. One company may offer fractional shares of an individual company, while others may not. Be sure to check out each brokerage\u2019s list of fractional share stocks and ETF offerings before opening an account. Fees and commissions: Some brokerages will be commission-free when it comes to investing in fractional shares, while others may charge additional fees. It is important to find out the brokerage\u2019s policy on this prior to opening an account. Account minimums: Many companies have no account minimum to open or maintain the account. Often, investors can buy fractional shares for as low as $1. Balance and investment minimums will differ from broker to broker. Research amenities: Once you open an account with an online broker or robo-advisor, you will have access to research amenities. Brokers will provide analysts\u2019 assessments of companies, which can help you determine which stocks you\u2019d like to invest in. Educational content: Knowing how to invest, what to invest in, and how to reach your financial goals are important. Educational content provided by your brokerage can help you to better understand which investments will help you reach your goals, and even how to better utilize your account amenities to track and monitor your investment. Fractional shares are very simply a portion, or fraction, of a whole share. When investing in fractional shares, you will buy a portion of a stock share. With this strategy, you are investing based on a dollar amount, not an individual stock\u2019s price or a certain number of shares. Buying fractional shares provides investors with a lower entry point of accessibility, thereby allowing investors to gain market entry sooner. While the concept of trading in fractional shares has been around since 1999, the strategy really wasn\u2019t widely available\u2014or financially feasible\u2014until 2019. A few low-fee companies offered fractional shares at that time, but this didn\u2019t last very long. Around 2019, online brokers cut fees drastically to offer low fees or no monthly fees, thus creating a path for investing in fractional shares to become advantageous. Prior to 2019, your portfolio may have had fractional shares, but it was most likely due to a few, limited circumstances: owning mutual funds, stock splits, dividend reinvestment programs, or company mergers or acquisitions. Your experience with investing in fractional shares will differ depending on which brokerage you decide to invest through. Each brokerage has its own guidelines, so finding out exactly what is offered will be important before deciding to invest. For example: If you are only buying a fraction of a share, you will also only get a fraction of the dividend, if the stock receives one. For example, if you want to invest in a stock that is trading at $100 per share, you don\u2019t need to have $100 to buy a full share, you can instead invest $25 and own one-fourth of a share. If this same stock happens to get a dividend that is $0.40 per share, you would likewise get one-fourth of the dividend, or $0.10. One online brokerage that offers fractional shares is Charles Schwab. Schwab refers to a fractional share as a \u201cslice.\u201d When buying a Schwab stock slice, investors have the choice to buy slices of 30 stocks in companies on the S&P 500 in one transaction. These shares can then be held and sold independently. One way to think of it is like investing in a mutual fund, but you have the flexibility to trade the individual stocks, or stock fractions. Buying fractional shares can be beneficial in several ways: affordability, diversification, and dollar cost averaging. Affordability: You don\u2019t have to wait until you have hundreds or thousands of dollars in order to buy enough shares of a stock. You can start investing with many online brokerages in fractional shares with only $1. Diversification: Investing lower dollar amounts and being able to diversify used to only be available in mutual funds. However, now that many brokerages offer fractional shares, investors can choose which companies they want to invest in, and can trade the fractional shares at any time\u2014unlike a mutual fund, which is bought and sold as a \u201cbasket\u201d of stocks. Having the option to only invest in a fractional share allows investors to choose several stocks rather than putting all of their money into just one company in order to purchase a certain amount of whole shares. Dollar cost averaging: Because investing in fractional shares is an option, investors can choose to pick a specific dollar amount to invest each month, for instance. By investing on a regular basis, investors can take advantage of price fluctuations in the market while also hedging against risk. Yes, you can buy fractional shares through Fidelity. With a minimum account balance of $0, and fractional share investing starting at only $1, Fidelity makes it easy to open an account and start investing in fractional shares. In fact, Investopedia ranks Fidelity as the Best Online Broker for ETFs, so if investing in fractional shares of ETFs is important to you, this company may be a great option. In all, Fidelity offers over 7,000 US stocks and ETFs in which investors can buy fractional shares. Investing in such small dollar amounts may not seem like a way to make money. If you treat this like contributing to an IRA or 401k on a monthly basis, though, your multiple, small investments will add up over time and create a very nice savings account. While one individual purchase is only buying a portion of a stock, or portions of several stocks, investing over months or years will allow those fractional shares to keep building, potentially into several full shares of several stocks. Yes, some companies will offer ETFs as fractional shares. Because each brokerage has different fractional share offerings, it is important to find out if the firm you want to invest with offers ETFs as fractional shares and what other stocks are on its fractional share list. The answer to this will depend upon how your brokerage handles the selling of fractional shares. Some brokerage firms do not guarantee liquidity of fractional shares. This will differ from broker to broker, so it is something to consider when choosing which firm you want to invest with. Liquidity refers to the ability to easily sell a stock or security and convert to cash. Even though you can buy fractional shares, you may not be able to sell fractional portions as easily as whole shares.

Each platform will have its own process. Next, gather your bank account and personal information, such as your Social Security number. The investment account platform will walk you through the process step-by-step. Here\u2019s what you can expect when setting up your automated investing account: You can set up an automated investment plan in a variety of ways. From robo-advisors to your employer 401(k), we\u2019ll give you the rundown. Choose one or more automated investment types to ensure that you are converting today\u2019s earnings into wealth for tomorrow. First, find out what information is required to open an automated investing account. The personal information and documentation required to complete the onboarding process typically includes: Fortunately for investors, there are many automated investment accounts with low-minimum deposit requirements. Minimum deposits can range from zero for many well-known investment brokerage firms up to $100,000 for the comprehensive Empower robo-advisor, which also includes access to certified financial planners. If you are new to investing and just starting out, you might open your automated investing account at a major brokerage firm that doesn\u2019t require a minimum investment, such as Fidelity Go. Or, if you\u2019re seeking a robo-advisor with low minimums, SoFi Automated Investing, M1 Finance, Betterment, Ally, and Ellevest all require $100 or less to get started. With so many choices about how to automate investing, it can be confusing to narrow down your selection. To make the decision easier, evaluate these factors: Customer service: Phone customer service can be very important for both new and experienced investors. Be aware that some platforms do not offer live customer service. If talking to a human matters to you, then look into live customer service availability and contact times. Fees and commissions: Research from Vanguard and other firms has shown a direct correlation between lower fees and higher investment performance. Before investing with any platform, understand the fees you\u2019ll be paying, including management fees and fund expense ratios. Determine whether the services you\u2019re receiving are worth the fees. Account minimum: Investigate how much money you\u2019ll need to open the account as well as maintain it. Determine whether there is a minimum balance requirement and if it is suitable for your financial situation. Research tools: For self-directed investment accounts, carefully review the screeners, calculators, trading platforms, and research report availability. If you\u2019re a self-directed investor, make certain, before opening an account, that the research tools match up with your needs. Automated investing is a strategy to ensure that you regularly save and invest for the future. We all have the tendency to forget to implement our best intentions. New Year's resolutions are frequently forgotten by February. Automated investing pre-programs our behavior to put investing for the future first. Automated investing is best for anyone interested in converting today's earnings into tomorrow's prosperity. This strategy works when saving for retirement, a child's college education, general wealth-building, and saving for any goal that is more than five years in the future. The automated investment concept involves implementing a few simple steps. First, select a paycheck, personal checking, or savings account from which the investment funds will be drawn. Next, choose where you want to invest. The choices include your workplace retirement account, a self-directed investment account, a micro-investing app, or a robo-advisor. Reinvesting your dividends and capital gains within your brokerage account is also considered automated investing. Pick the specific investments, and then set up a regular transfer from the cash account into the investment account. Finally, you choose the amount and frequency of your auto investment strategy. Once the plan is enacted, your money will automatically transfer into the designated accounts and investments. That way, when markets go down, you\u2019ll be less tempted to stop investing, because the entire process is automated. In fact, when markets go down, you\u2019ll be set up to benefit from one of the best investment tenets: \u201cBuy low.\u201d Think of automated investing like automated bill pay. You set up the parameters, such as amount to be invested, the investment vehicles, and the funding method. After setup, regular transfers from your bank account or paycheck go directly to your investment accounts.\u00a0This automates the contributions to your investment account. If you have a self-directed account, you may have another step to them put that money to work. Often this can be eliminated if you are buying into pre-built portfolios offered by your brokerage. You can also automate the investment portfolio through a robo-advisor where the contributions will automatically be invested according to the allocations and rules that were created as part of your account setup. Automated investing is a good idea for nearly everyone. Behavioral finance research suggests that we are not always rational decision-makers. By helping you overcome less optimal investment behavior, such as irregular investing or avoiding investment, automated investing can improve your long-term financial success. Automated investing removes money from your account before you can spend it and diverts it into long-term financial assets, leading to wealth-building, Investing in financial markets is risky in that the value of your initial investment can decline. In fact, automated investing might be considered less risky than do-it-yourself investing. By regularly deploying money into the financial markets during both up and down markets, you are practicing dollar-cost-averaging. This ensures that you will buy more shares when prices are lower and fewer shares when prices are higher. This is the \u201cbuy low\u201d recommendation in action. Micro-investing apps have their pros and cons. The benefit of these round-up investment apps is that you can get started and continue investing regularly. The disadvantage is that if you only invest your spare change and do not set up a larger automated deposit into the app, it will take you a long time to build a substantial account balance. For example, assume that monthly, you invest $50 in spare change into your investment account, which earns an average 7% per year. After 10 years, that account will be worth $8,704. Now add in a $350 monthly auto deposit in addition to the $50 spare change investment and you\u2019re investing $400 per month. With an average 7% annual return, your account will grow to roughly $69,637 in 10 years. Yes, there are multiple reasons to use an automated investing platform. Anyone serious about planning for their future would be wise to consider setting up automated investment strategies.

Learn the various ways to invest in Web 3.0 EDUARD MUZHEVSKYI / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY / Getty Images The internet has connected the world in more ways than any other technology. With people getting more concerned about their data and privacy, however, the internet in its current state seems inadequate. There are serious concerns over how big companies handle and monetize user data, creating the need for a better or alternative internet. Web 3.0 is an alternative that is becoming popular because it puts the internet's power back into the hands of end users. We\u2019ve answered common questions around Web 3.0 investments in this guide, in a way any beginner investor can understand. Web 3.0 offers investors different investment vehicles that can cater to different risk appetites. Nevertheless, just like every form of investment, investing in Web3 is risky and should only be done with adequate research and a good strategy. The most common Web3 investment options are stocks, cryptos, and NFTs. However, there are also less popular investment methods you can consider, such as angel investing or buying into the IDO (Initial DEX Offering) or ICO (Initial Coin Offering) of a crypto company. In both methods, you invest in a company by participating in a seed round or buying its coin before launch. One thing to note is that most of Web3 investing is based on narratives: investors spreading the word on what a company is doing to grow the Web3 ecosystem. However, you shouldn\u2019t depend on narratives when making decisions.That\u2019s because some Web3 influencers push a good narrative about a project to get people to buy into the project, and then they end up dumping the project. Instead, focus on investments with a reasonable historic performance, like these three options. Stocks are one of the easiest ways to get into Web3, especially as they give you some level of Web3 exposure. Several companies actively involved in Web3 are Web2 companies with multiple sources of income, and so might not be affected by a Web3 downturn like these Web3 stocks: NFTs are unique digital assets on a blockchain. They show ownership and cannot be copied. You can buy an NFT from a secondary marketplace such as OpenSea or Magic Eden or choose to mint them and hold for a profit. NFTs are important Web3 investments because they can be used to unlock special privileges or as an investment in a Web3 company. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies operated by a decentralized entity on the blockchain. Like regular money, crypto can be used to pay for goods and services and as an investment option. Crypto allows direct exposure into the space and is a good fit for people who want to aggressively invest in Web 3.0 Crypto is highly volatile. So, if you\u2019re a risk-averse trader, you might want to consider other lower-risk options like crypto ETFs and fractional shares. These options provide you with direct exposure but cushion you from the market's daily volatility. Web 3.0 investments, like any other investment, poses some risk to investors. The biggest risks are volatility, security, and reliability on existing Web3 investment processes and infrastructures. The foundation of Web3 is built on emerging technologies such as blockchain tech, smart contracts, and AI. An investment into Web3 positions gives you the chance to be an early adopter of these disruptive technologies. Web3 has the potential to overturn how we do almost everything, from shopping to payments to the way we consume content. As an investment class, Web3 will shape how companies will raise startup capital and generate money from their funding rounds. Most importantly, investment in Web3 is largely profitable and can provide impressive returns over shorter time frames. To get the most out of any Web3 investment, you must: Investing in Web3 can be challenging, especially if you don\u2019t have a clear plan or failed to do your research. It\u2019s essential you consider these factors before you make a Web3 investment: After you have clearly designed and mapped out your investment goals and the investment timeline, you need to know the founders behind the Web3 project of interest. Choose projects with publicly known founders. You can easily reach out in case the project goes south. Assess your risk tolerance level and go for a project allowed in your country to avoid legal issues with your investment. Web 3.0 (or Web3) is a general name for the new, user-centric version of the internet that integrates new concepts like decentralization, blockchain tech, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) into everyday internet use. It is a decentralized version of the internet that promises to help users better control their data usage and sharing while enhancing monetization and reducing exposure to data manipulation. The concept of Web3 is not to make our current internet obsolete; it\u2019s to integrate these technologies into the existing infrastructure, allowing everyone to freely use the internet. For example, if you make a Facebook or Instagram post that goes against Meta\u2019s community standards, the social media giant could take the post down or ban your account. This would likely be impossible in Web 3.0 since most platforms will be decentralized. Although it is still a work in progress, many individuals, companies, and even governments have started to position themselves adequately for web3. The Hong Kong government is preparing to adopt a framework for integrating this technology into many of its city's processes. Since Gavin Wood coined the term in 2014, Web3 has grown to offer potential for diverse opportunities. In recent years, there have been lots of conversations around Web3 and the opportunities it offers investors. While Web3 investment opportunities have become an industry buzzword, many have yet to realize its importance and how they can invest before it officially launches. No. You cannot invest directly in Web 3.0, but you can choose to be an active or passive investor through a variety of investment options. Active investment options include cryptocurrency and NFTs, while passive investment options involve buying stocks in companies actively engaged in Web 3.0. Web 2.0 is the current internet, which has birthed innovations like social media, e-commerce stores, and search engines. These innovations have made content king and provided a way to create content, unlike in Web 1.0, where internet users could only access limited information. Although beneficial, these Web 2.0 innovations introduced data and privacy issues, giving tech giants access to tons of user data. Web 3.0 is an upgrade to Web 2.0 and offers a way for internet users to control their data, use decentralized technologies to store and share information, and voluntarily conceal their digital identities. In Web 3.0, users will make faster and cheaper payments for goods and services using cryptocurrencies. With Metaverse development currently underway, Web3 could change how we experience the world around us, opening us to more immersive experiences e.g the Metaverse. Web 3.0 investment options are more volatile than regular investment options. Although not completely unsafe, there is a big risk of ending up on the wrong side of the volatility. This is why it\u2019s critical to have a good level of knowledge, do your research, and come up with a robust investment plan. Another issue of concern is in regards to the current state of regulations. This new technology is still very much unregulated, and governments and regulating bodies could institute policies unfavorable to investors. Web 3.0 investing is not for all types of investors, especially those with a low-risk appetite or who are looking to get into investing gradually. It is a fast-moving investment class that requires some level of industry knowledge, patience, and timing. The nature of Web 3 investments makes them a good fit for investors who fall into any of the categories below. Investing in Web 3.0 is highly risky. As a Web3 investor, you should have a huge risk appetite and only put in money you can afford to lose. The volatility of many Web 3 assets makes it a highly unpredictable asset class. For example, between February 20, 2023, and March 10, 2023, Bitcoin rose to $24,500 and plummeted to $19,500 before touching $30k. Without a huge risk appetite, you could prematurely sell your investments and make constant losses. To make tangible returns on your Web 3.0 investment, you need to put in a significant sum of money. Since it is recommended that you use not more than 10% of your entire portfolio to make Web3 investments, you need to have a diversified portfolio that is not fully reliant on this investment class. A higher capital investment would yield more returns but could also translate into more losses. Consider investing in leveraged assets and futures trading if you have a big risk appetite but limited capital.

            "title": "How Does the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) Work?",
            "content": "The dividend discount model (DDM) is used by investors to measure the value of a stock. It is similar to the discounted cash flow (DFC) valuation method;\u00a0the difference is that DDM focuses on dividends while the DCF focuses on cash flow. For the DCF, an investment is valued based on its future\u00a0cash flows. DCF analysis assesses the value of a company\u00a0today based on projections of how much money it will generate in the\u00a0future. A DCF analysis uses a discount rate to find the present value of a stock. If the value calculated through DCF is higher than the current cost of the investment, the investor will consider the stock an opportunity. For the DDM, future dividends are worth less because of the time value of money. Investors use the DDM to price stocks based on the sum of future income flows from dividends using the risk-adjusted required rate of return. Investors can use the dividend discount model (DDM) for stocks that have just been issued or that have traded on the secondary market for years. There are two circumstances when DDM is practically inapplicable: when the stock does not issue dividends, and when\u00a0the stock has an unusually high growth rate. Each common share of a company represents an equity claim on the issuing corporation's future cash flows. Investors can reasonably assume that the present value of a common stock is the present value of expected future cash flows. This is the basic premise of DCF analysis. The DDM assumes that dividends are the relevant cash flows. Dividends represent income received without loss of asset (selling the stock for capital gains) and are comparable to coupon payments from a bond. Although DDM advocates believe that, sooner or later, all firms will pay dividends on their common stock, the model is much more difficult to use without a benchmark dividend history. The formula for using DDM is most prevalent\u00a0when the issuing corporation has a track record of dividend payments. It's incredibly difficult to forecast when, and to what extent, a non-dividend-paying firm will begin distributing dividends to shareholders. Controlling shareholders have a much stronger sense of control over other forms of cash flow so that the DCF method might be more appropriate for them. A stock that grows too quickly will end up distorting the basic Gordon-Growth DDM formula, possibly even creating a negative denominator and causing a stock's value to read negative. Other DDM methods may help to mitigate this problem."

            "title": "Common Stock: What It Is, Different Types, vs. Preferred Stock",
            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Common stock is not just a piece of paper\u2014or, these days, a digital entry\u2014but a ticket to ownership in a company. When you hold common stock, you get to weigh in on corporate decisions by voting for the board of directors and corporate policies. Over the long term, this type of equity can offer attractive returns. But remember, this comes with a catch: if a company has to liquidate its assets, common stockholders are at the back of the line, getting paid only after bondholders, preferred shareholders, and other creditors have gotten their share. The value of common stock issued is reported in the stockholder's equity section of a company's balance sheet. Common stock is primarily a form of ownership in a corporation, representing a claim on part of the company's assets and earnings. If you're a shareholder, this makes \u201cpart-owner,\u201d but this doesn't mean you own the company's physical assets like chairs or computers; those are owned by the corporation itself, a distinct legal entity. Instead, as a shareholder, you own a residual claim to the company's profits and assets, which means you are entitled to what's left after all other obligations are met. Traded on exchanges, common stock can be bought and sold by investors or traders, and common stockholders are entitled to dividends when the company's board of directors declares them. Typically, they are paid out of a company's earnings, and the decision to distribute them is made by the board taking into account factors like company performance, future capital requirements, and broader financial goals. The first-ever common stock was issued in 1602 by the Dutch East India Company and traded on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Over the following four centuries years, stock markets have been created worldwide, with major exchanges like the London Stock Exchange and the Tokyo Stock Exchange listing tens of thousands of companies. Larger U.S.-based stocks are traded on a public exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq. As of mid-2024, the Nasadaq had some 3,377 listings but the NYSE the largest in the world by market cap. Smaller companies that can't meet the listing requirements of these major exchanges are considered unlisted and their stocks are traded over the counter. Preferred stock is a distinct class of stock that provides different rights compared with common stock. While both types confer ownership in a company, preferred stockholders have a higher claim to the company's assets and dividends than common stockholders. This elevated status is reflected in the name \u201cpreferred\u201d stock. Common and preferred stock both let investors own a stake in a business, but there are key differences that investors need to understand. Shareholders in a company have the right to vote on important decisions regarding the company's management. For example, shareholders vote on the members of the board of directors. Usually, common stock allows the shareholder to vote, but preferred stock often does not confer voting rights. Both common and preferred stockholders can receive dividends from a company. However, preferred stock dividends are specified in advance based on the share's par or face value and the dividend rate of the stock. Businesses can choose whether or not and how much to pay in dividends to common stockholders. Should a company not have enough money to pay all stockholders dividends, preferred stockholders have priority over common stockholders and get paid first. For holders of cumulative preferred stock, any skipped dividend payments accumulate as \u201cdividends in arrears\u201d and must be paid before dividends are issued to common stockholders. Common stock and preferred stock trade on the open market. Investors can choose to purchase or sell either type of share. However, investors generally trade common stocks rather than preferred stocks. Due to their fixed dividends and lower risk profile, preferred stocks typically have less price volatility and greater growth potential than common stocks. Because of their stable dividends and lower volatility, preferred stocks are often favored by institutional investors pursuing a predictable income stream. These stocks are also normally less liquid than common stocks, meaning they are traded less frequently, making them less suitable for retail investors looking for short-term gains. For common stock, when a company goes bankrupt, the common stockholders do not receive their share of the assets until after creditors, bondholders, and preferred shareholders. This makes common stock riskier than debt or preferred shares. The upside to common shares is they usually outperform bonds and preferred shares in the long run. Most companies issue all three types of securities. For example, Wells Fargo & Company has several bonds available on the secondary market: preferred stock, such as its Series L (WFC-L), and common stock (WFC). For a company to issue stock, it initiates an initial public offering (IPO). An IPO is a major way for a company seeking additional capital to expand the enterprise. To begin the IPO process, a company works with an underwriting investment bank to determine the type and price of the stock. Once the IPO is complete, the stock becomes available for purchase by the general public on the secondary market. Both common stock and preferred stock have pros and cons for investors to consider. More frequently traded than preferred stock Higher potential returns Voting rights May not receive dividends Lower priority to receive dividends or in the event of bankruptcy More price volatility Higher priority to receive dividends Less price volatility Fixed dividends that won't decrease May lack voting rights Lower potential returns Traded less frequently Stocks should be considered an important part of any investor\u2019s portfolio. They carry greater risk than assets like CDs, preferred stocks, and bonds. However, the greater risk comes with a higher potential for rewards. Over the long term, stocks tend to outperform other investments but in the short term have more volatility. Investors can choose from different kinds of common stock. Growth stocks belong to companies expected to experience increasing earnings, which raises their share value. Meanwhile, value stocks are priced lower relative to their fundamentals and often pay dividends, unlike growth stocks. Stocks are also classified by market capitalization into large-, mid-, and small-cap categories. Large-cap stocks are more frequently traded and usually represent well-established, stable companies. In contrast, small-cap stocks often belong to newer, growth-oriented firms and tend to be more volatile. Investors can trade for preferred stock just like common stock. However, because of how they differ from common stock, investors need a different approach when investing in them. Researching the issuing company is essential. Investing in preferred stock from a shaky company is as risky as buying its common stock. If the company fares poorly, both types of stock are likely to produce losses. One key thing to consider when choosing preferred stock is the dividend. Compare the dividends you'll receive relative to the share price to determine if the yield offers an attractive return. A better yield can result in greater returns. Moreover, take note of whether the stock is callable or convertible. Callable preferred stocks can be repurchased by the issuer at a preset date and price, causing you to miss out on future dividends. Convertible preferred stock, meanwhile, can be converted into common stock at the company's discretion, which can be an advantage if the price of the common stock rises significantly. Most ordinary common shares come with one vote per share, granting shareholders the right to vote on corporate actions, often conducted at company shareholder meeting. If you cannot attend, you can cast your vote by proxy, where a third party will vote on your behalf. The most important votes are taken on issues like the company engaging in a merger or acquisition, whom to elect to the board of directors, or whether to approve stock splits or dividends. Common stock represents a residual ownership stake in a company, the right to claim any other corporate assets after all other financial obligations have been met. A company maintains a balance sheet composed of assets and liabilities. Assets include what the company owns or is owed, such as its property, equipment, cash reserves, and accounts receivable. On the other side of the ledger are liabilities, which are what the company owes. These include payables, debts, and other obligations. If a company is healthy, the total assets will be larger than the total liabilities. The residual amount left to the owners is known as shareholders' equity and is represented by a company's shares. Selling preferred stock, like any other shares, lets a company raise money by selling a stake in the business. A company may do this to raise capital for business expansion, debt repayment, or to invest in new projects. Preferred stocks are less dilutive of company ownership since they do not come with voting rights. They offer the issuing firm other benefits, not least because being less volatile makes them appeal to different investors. The fixed dividends also stabilize the company's balance sheet, making it more attractive to additional investors. Another reason is that, for some companies, the cost of issuing preferred stock is lower than issuing bonds. Unlike interest payments on bonds, dividends on preferred stock are not mandatory and generally are not tax-deductible for the corporation. However, they might still be less costly than the higher interest rates a company might have to pay to entice bond investors. Each type has pros and cons. Common stock tends to offer higher potential returns, but more volatility. Preferred stock may be less volatile but have a lower potential for returns. This suggests that long-term investors who can handle greater volatility will prefer common stock, while those who want to avoid such fluctuations are more likely to choose preferred stock. Common and Preferred are the two major types. Some companies issue different classes of stock or even types of common stock. For example, Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has two classes of common stock: GOOG and GOOGL. Common stock, as its name implies, is one of the most ordinary types of stock. It gives shareholders a stake in the underlying business, as well as voting rights to elect a board of directors and a claim to a portion of the company's assets and future revenues. However, common stockholders have a lower position than preferred stockholders, who get priority on dividend payments and in recovering their investment if the company is liquidated.

            "title": "What Is a Debt/Equity Swap? How It Works and Who Benefits",
            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). A debt/equity swap is a transaction in which the obligations or debts of a company or individual are exchanged for something of value, namely, equity. In the case of a publicly-traded company, this generally entails an exchange of bonds for stock. The value of the stocks and bonds being exchanged is typically determined by the market at the time of the swap. A debt/equity swap is a refinancing deal in which a debt holder gets an equity position in exchange for the cancellation of the debt. The swap is generally done to help a struggling company continue to operate. The logic behind this is an insolvent company cannot pay its debts or improve its equity standing. However, sometimes a company may simply wish to take advantage of favorable market conditions. Covenants in the bond indenture may prevent a swap from happening without consent. In cases of bankruptcy, the debt holder does not have a choice about whether he wants to make the debt/equity swap. However, in other cases, he may have a choice in the matter. To entice people into debt/equity swaps, businesses often offer advantageous trade ratios. For example, if the business offers a 1:1 swap ratio, the bondholder receives stocks worth exactly the same amount as his bonds, not a particularly advantageous trade. However, if the company offers a 1:2 ratio, the bondholder receives stocks valued at twice as much as his bonds, making the trade more enticing. Debt/equity swaps can offer debt holders equity because the business does not want to or cannot pay the face value of the bonds it has issued. To delay repayment, it offers stock\u00a0instead. In other cases, businesses have to maintain certain debt/equity ratios and invite debt holders to swap their debts for equity if\u00a0the company helps to adjust that balance. These debt/equity ratios are often part of financing requirements imposed by lenders. In\u00a0other cases, businesses use debt/equity swaps as part of their bankruptcy restructuring. If a company decides to declare bankruptcy, it has a choice between Chapter 7 and Chapter 11. Under Chapter 7, all of the business's debts are eliminated, and the business no longer operates. Under Chapter 11, the business continues its operations while restructuring its finances. In many cases, Chapter 11 reorganization cancels the company's existing equity shares. It then reissues new shares to the debt holders, and the bondholders and creditors become the new shareholders in the company. An equity/debt swap is the opposite of a debt/equity swap. Instead of trading debt for equity, shareholders swap equity for debt. Essentially, they exchange stocks for bonds. Generally, Equity/Debt swaps are conducted in order to facilitate smooth mergers or restructuring in a company. Suppose company ABC has a $100 million debt that it is unable to service. The company offers 25% percent ownership to its two debtors in exchange for writing off the entire debt amount. This is a debt-for-equity swap in which the company has exchanged its debt holdings for equity ownership by two lenders."

Both types of stock represent a fractional ownership in a company, and both are tools that investors can purchase to try to profit from the future successes of the business. However there are differences between preferred and common stock that investors should understand. An important one is that preferred stock shareholders have priority over a company's income, meaning they are paid dividends before common stock shareholders. They are also paid first if a company is liquidated. Preferred stock usually does not give shareholders voting rights. Common or ordinary stock does, usually at one vote per share owned. Preferred stock is a type of security that shares characteristics of bonds and stocks. Like bonds, they provide investors with a predictable flow of income. That's because their dividends are determined when the stock is issued. At the same time, they represent ownership in a company and are traded on an exchange. Preferred stock has a par value which is affected by interest rates. When interest\u00a0rates\u00a0rise, the value of the preferred\u00a0stock declines, and vice versa. In addition, the price of preferred stock is normally less volatile than the price of common stock. Preferreds\u00a0also have a callability feature similar to bonds which gives the issuer the right to redeem the shares from the market after a predetermined time. Investors who buy preferred shares have a real opportunity for these shares to be called back at a redemption rate that represents a significant premium over their purchase price. The market for preferred shares often anticipates callbacks and prices may be bid up accordingly. In case of bankruptcy or liquidation, preferred stock shareholders have a priority claim on a company's assets and earnings. This is also true during the company's good times, when the company has excess cash and decides to distribute money to investors through dividends. As mentioned, preferred stock shareholders are paid their dividends before common stock shareholders (who may or may not receive dividends). If a company misses a dividend payment, it must first pay any arrears to preferred stock shareholders before paying common stock shareholders. In addition, the dividends for preferred stock are usually higher than those for common stock. The annual dividend per share is calculated by multiplying the dividend rate by the stock's par value. The\u00a0dividend yield\u00a0of a preferred stock is calculated by dividing\u00a0the dollar amount of a dividend by the price of the stock. Preferred stock confers no voting rights. So when it comes time for a company to elect a board of directors or vote on any form of corporate policy, preferred shareholders have no voice about the future of the company. Usually pays a set dividend Volatility can be low Offers income and some growth potential Can be called away by issuers No voting rights If interest rates rise, price falls One type of preferred stock, the perpetual preferred stock, guarantees\u00a0a fixed dividend in perpetuity. Another type, convertible preferred stock, offers investors the opportunity to convert preferred shares into common stock. Common stock represents shares of ownership in a corporation and a claim on profits. It is the type of stock in which most people invest. When people talk about stocks, they are usually referring to common stock. In fact, the great majority of stock is issued in this form. With common stocks, share value is determined by supply and demand. Common shares confer voting rights. Investors usually receive one vote per share owned. They vote to elect board members who oversee the major decisions made by management. Stockholders thus have the ability to exercise control over corporate policy and management issues. Common stock tends to outperform preferred shares and offers the greater potential for long-term growth. If a company does well, the value of a common stock can go up. But keep in mind, if the company does poorly, the stock's value normally goes down. A company's board of directors decides whether or not to pay out a dividend to common stockholders. They are never guaranteed. In fact, many companies do not pay common stock dividends at all. If a company misses a dividend, the common stock shareholder gets paid after those holding preferred shares. The claim on a company's income and earnings is most important during times of insolvency. In such a case, common stock shareholders are last in line for the company's assets. This means that when the company must liquidate, it pays all creditors and bondholders first, then preferred shareholders, and finally, common stockholders. Potential for high growth Highly liquid Voting rights Volatility can be normal Risk of dropping prices May not receive dividends The first common stock was issued by the Dutch East India Company in 1602. Investors might want to invest in preferred stock because of the steady income and high yields that they can offer, dividends that are usually higher than those for common stock, and their stable prices. Common stock offers greater potential growth in value because its price tends to move to a much greater degree. Capital gains are a greater possibility with common stock. Each has its risks. However preferred stock generally is seen as less risky because its price moves are less volatile and its shareholders are always paid dividends before common stock shareholders. Preferred stock and common stock can both be attractive securities for investors. While preferred stock may offer a steady source of income compared to common stock, its share price normally has less growth potential. Common stock shareholders get voting rights while shareholders of preferred stock normally do not. As a result, they can't influence company decisions concerning important matters such as the selection of board members, acquisitions, and stock splits.

            "title": "Floating Stock: Definition, Example, and Why It's Important",
            "content": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street. Floating stock is the number of shares available for trading of a particular stock. Low float stocks are those with a low number of shares. Floating stock is calculated by subtracting closely-held shares and restricted stock from a firm\u2019s total outstanding shares. Closely-held shares are those owned by insiders, major shareholders, and employees. Restricted stock refers to insider shares that cannot be traded because of a temporary restriction, such as the lock-up period after an initial public offering (IPO). A stock with a small float will generally be more volatile than a stock with a large float. This is because, with fewer shares available, it may be harder to find a buyer or seller. This results in larger spreads and often lower volume. A company may have a large number of shares outstanding, but limited floating stock. For example, assume a company has 50 million shares outstanding. Of that 50 million shares, large institutions own 35 million shares, management and insiders own 5 million, and the employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) holds 2 million shares. Floating stock is therefore only 8 million shares (50 million shares minus 42 million shares), or 16% of the outstanding shares. The amount of a company\u2019s floating stock may rise or fall over time. This can occur for a variety of reasons. For example, a company may sell additional shares to raise more capital, which then increases the floating stock. If restricted or closely-held shares become available, then the floating stock will also increase. On the flip side, if a company decides to implement a share buyback, then the number of outstanding shares will decrease. In this case, the floating shares as a percentage of outstanding stock will also go down. A stock split will increase floating shares, while a reverse stock split decreases float. A company's\u00a0float\u00a0is an important number for investors because it indicates how many shares are actually available to be bought and sold by the general investing public. Low float is typically an impediment to active trading. This lack of trading activity can make it difficult for investors to enter or exit positions in stocks that have limited float. Institutional investors will often avoid trading in companies with smaller floats because there are fewer shares to trade, thus leading to limited liquidity and wider bid-ask spreads. Instead, institutional investors (such as mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies) that buy large blocks of stock will look to invest in companies with a larger float. If they invest in companies with a big float, their large purchases will not impact the share price as much. A\u00a0company is not responsible for how shares within the float are traded by the public\u2014this is a function of the\u00a0secondary market. Therefore, shares that are purchased, sold, or even shorted by investors do not affect the float because these actions do not represent a change in the number of shares available for trade.\u00a0They simply represent a redistribution of shares. Similarly, the creation and trading of options on a stock do not affect the float. As of September 2023, General Electric (GE) had 1.088 billion shares outstanding. Of this, 0.20% were held by insiders and 75.81% were held by large institutions. Therefore, a total of 76% or 830 million shares were likely not available for public trading. The floating stock is therefore about 260 million shares (1.088 billion - 830 million). It is important to note that institutions don't hold a stock forever. The institutional ownership number will change regularly, although not always by a significant percentage. Falling institutional ownership coupled with a falling share price could signal that institutions are dumping the shares. Increasing institutional ownership shows that institutions are accumulating shares. Stock float isn't good or bad, but it can affect an investor's decisions. The amount of floating stock a company has\u2014the shares made available to trade\u2014can affect the liquidity of that stock. Stocks with a smaller float tend to have high volatility, while stocks with a larger float tend to have lower volatility. Some investors may prefer stocks with higher float, because it's easier to enter and exit positions for these stocks. Stock flotation is when a company issues new shares to the public. It can help the company raise capital. The opposite of stock flotation is a float shrink, such as with stock buybacks: fewer shares are available to trade. The floating shares are the shares available to trade, while non-floating shares are those held by shareholders and company insiders and are not available for trading. A company's floating stock is the shares it has available to trade on the open market. Traders tend to prefer stocks with larger floats, as they find it easier to enter and exit a stock that has greater liquidity. Stocks with larger floats have more shares available, making them more liquid and easier for investors to buy or sell.

            "content": "The S&P 500 Index or Standard & Poor's 500 Index is a market-capitalization-weighted index of 500 leading\u00a0publicly traded companies in the U.S.\u00a0The index includes 503 components because three have two share classes listed. It's not an exact list of the top 500 U.S. companies by market cap because the index includes other criteria. The S&P 500 index\u00a0is nonetheless regarded as one of the best gauges of prominent American equities' performance and the stock market overall. Investopedia / Julie Bang The S&P 500 uses a market-cap weighting method that gives a higher percentage allocation to companies with the largest market capitalizations. Determining the weighting of each component of the S&P 500 begins with calculating the total market cap for the index by adding together the market cap of every company in the index. The market cap of a company is calculated by taking the current stock price and multiplying it by the company's outstanding shares. The total market cap for the S&P 500 as well as the market caps of individual companies are published frequently on financial websites, saving investors the need to calculate them. The weighting of each company in the index is calculated by taking the company's market cap and dividing it by the total market cap of the index. The S&P 500 is a part of the S&P Global 1200 family of indices. Other indices include the S&P MidCap 400 which represents the mid-cap range of companies and\u00a0the S&P SmallCap 600 which represents small-cap companies. The S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600 combine\u00a0to cover 90% of all U.S. capitalization in an index known as the S&P Composite 1500. The S&P uses only free-floating shares, the shares that the public can trade, when calculating market cap. The S&P adjusts each company's market cap to compensate for new share issues or company mergers. The value of the index is calculated by totaling the adjusted market caps of each company and dividing the result by a divisor. The divisor is proprietary information of the S&P and isn't released to the public. The S&P Index (SPX) isn't a total return index and doesn't include cash dividend gains for the companies listed. You can nonetheless calculate a company's weighting in the index and this can provide investors with valuable information. You can get a sense as to whether it might have an impact on the overall index if a stock rises or falls. A company with a 10% weighting would have a greater impact on the value of the index than a company with a 2% weighting. The S&P 500 is one of the most widely quoted American indexes because it represents the largest publicly\u00a0traded corporations in the U.S. It focuses on the U.S. market's large-cap sector and it's also a float-weighted index which is a type of capitalization weighting. Company market caps are adjusted by the number of shares available for public trading. The S&P 500's most recent rebalancing was announced on March 1, 2024 and it took effect before the markets opened on March 18, 2024. Super Micro Computer and Deckers Outdoor replaced Whirlpool Corp. and Zions Bancorporation N.A. respectively at that time. Another common U.S. stock market benchmark is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The S&P 500 is often the institutional investor's preferred index given its depth and breadth. The DJIA has historically been associated with significant equities from the retail investor's point of view. Institutional investors perceive the S&P 500 as being more representative of U.S. equity markets\u00a0because it includes more stocks across all sectors: 500 versus the Dow's 30. The S&P 500 uses a market-cap weighting method that gives a higher percentage allocation to companies with the largest market caps. The DJIA is a price-weighted index that gives companies with higher stock prices a higher index weighting. The market-cap-weighted structure tends to be more common than the price-weighted index across U.S. indexes. Nasdaq is a global electronic marketplace for trading securities. Several equity market indexes include stocks traded on Nasdaq. A given stock included in the S&P 500 Index may also be in one or more of the various Nasdaq indexes. Some of the most-watched Nasdaq stock indices include: The S&P 500\u00a0is a member of a set of indexes created by Standard & Poor's. This set of indexes is like the Russell index family in that both are market-cap-weighted unless stated otherwise as in the case of equal-weighted indexes. There are two significant differences between the construction of the S&P and the Russell families of indexes. Standard & Poor's chooses constituent companies via a committee. Russell indexes use\u00a0a formula to select\u00a0which stocks to\u00a0include. There's no name overlap within S&P style indices such as growth versus value. Russell indexes will include the same company in both the value and growth style indexes. The Vanguard 500 Index Fund aims to track the price and yield performance of the S&P 500 Index by investing\u00a0its total net assets in the stocks that make up the index and by holding each component with approximately the same weight as the S&P index. The fund barely deviates from the S&P in this way, which it's designed to mimic. The S&P 500 is an index so it can't be traded directly. Anyone who wants to invest in the companies that are included in the S&P must invest in a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the index such as the Vanguard 500 ETF (VOO). One of the limitations of the S&P and other market-cap-weighted indexes occurs when stocks in the index become overvalued. They rise higher than their fundamentals warrant. The stock typically inflates the overall value or price of the index if it has a heavy weighting in the index while being overvalued. A company's rising market cap isn't necessarily indicative of its fundamentals. It simply reflects the stock's increase in value relative to the shares outstanding. Equal-weighted indexes have become increasingly popular as a result. Each company's stock price movements have an equal impact on these indexes. The individual market weights must be calculated by dividing the market cap of each company by the total market cap of the index to understand how the underlying stocks affect the S&P index. Here's an example of Apple's weighting in the index: The larger the market weight of a company, the more impact each 1% change in a stock's price will have on the index. S&P doesn't provide the total list of all 503 components on its website, just the top 10. The first S&P Index was launched in 1923 as a joint project between the Standard Statistical Bureau and Poor's Publishing. The original index covered 233 companies. The two companies merged in 1941 to become Standard and Poor's. A company must be publicly traded and based in the United States to be included in the S&P 500 Index. It must also meet certain requirements for liquidity and market capitalization, have a public float of at least 10% of its shares, and have positive earnings over the trailing four quarters. The simplest way to invest in the S&P 500 Index or any other stock market index is to buy shares of an index fund that targets it. These funds invest in a cross-section of the companies represented on the index so the fund's performance should mirror the performance of the index itself. The S&P 500 Index is one of the most widely used indexes for the U.S. stock market. These 500 companies represent the largest and most liquid companies in the U.S. from technology and software companies to banks and manufacturers. The index has historically been used to provide insight into the direction of the stock market. It was created by a private company but the S&P 500 is a popular yardstick for the performance of the market economy at large.

            "title": "How Does Warren Buffett Choose His Stocks?",
            "content": "5 Key Clues to the Legendary Investor's Formula for Success Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. Fellow investors have long praised\u2014and envied\u2014Warren Buffett's seemingly uncanny ability to pick stocks. By steadfastly following certain investing principles, he has amassed a net worth estimated at $130 billion, as of July 2024. So what exactly does he look for in a stock? Here are some clues. Alison Czinkota / Investopedia Warren Buffett belongs to the value investing school, popularized by his mentor Benjamin Graham. Value investing focuses on the intrinsic value\u00a0of a particular stock rather than technical indicators, such as moving averages, volume, or momentum. Determining intrinsic value\u00a0is an exercise in understanding a company's financials, especially official filings such as earnings and income statements. In making investments for his holding company,\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett follows a longtime and well-publicized strategy, seeking out the shares of businesses with consistent earning power, a good return on equity (ROE), and capable management\u2014and that are also sensibly priced, if not underpriced). To help guide him in these decisions, Buffett asks several key questions: Companies that have been providing a reliable return on equity (ROE) for many years are more desirable than those that have had only a short period of solid returns, in Buffett's view. And the greater the number of years of good ROE, the better. In order to gauge historical performance, an investor should review at least five to 10 years of a company's ROE, he maintains. When looking at a company's historic return on equity (ROE), it's also essential to compare it with the ROE of the company's top competitors in the same industry. Having a large ratio of debt to equity should raise a red flag, especially if earnings growth has coincided with adding on more debt, such as through acquisitions. Instead, Buffett prefers earnings growth to come from shareholders' equity (SE). A company with positive shareholders' equity is generating enough cash flow to cover its liabilities and not relying on debt to keep it growing or afloat. Buffett looks for companies that have a good profit margin, especially those whose profit margins are growing. As is the case with ROE, he looks at the profit margin over several years to discount short-term trends. For a company to stay on Buffett's radar, its management should be adept at growing profit margins year-over-year, a sign that it is also good at controlling operating costs. Buffett considers companies whose products and services can be easily substituted for riskier than companies with more unique offerings. For example, an oil company whose principal product is crude oil may be vulnerable to competitive forces because clients can buy crude oil from any number of other sources, not to mention alternative types of energy. However, if the company has unique access to a more desirable grade of oil that many businesses need, that might make it an investment worth looking at. In this case, the company's desirable grade of oil could be a competitive advantage that will help produce profits year after year. In a similar vein, Buffett has long been a major investor in Coca-Cola. While there are many colas and other soft drinks on the market, there is only one Coke. Reflecting on that investment in Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 annual report, Buffett wrote, \"In August 1994\u2014yes, 1994\u2014Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400 million shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion\u2014then a very meaningful sum at Berkshire. The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie [Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime business partner] and I were required to do was cash Coke's quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow.\" This is the crux of value investing: finding companies that have good fundamentals but are trading below where they should be. And the greater the discount, the more room for profitability. Put another way, the goal for value investors like Buffett is to discover companies that are undervalued compared to their intrinsic value. While there is no exact formula for calculating intrinsic value, investors can look at a variety of factors\u2014such as management strength and future earnings potential\u2014to gauge it. Unlike value investors who seek out solid (but sometimes humdrum) companies that may be selling for less than they are worth, growth investors look for companies with unusually strong growth prospects, almost regardless of their current price. Growth investors often put their money on young, seemingly hot companies, while value investors tend to favor long-established ones. Through his company, Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's five largest holdings as of December 31, 2023 were (in order of aggregate fair value): American Express, Apple, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, and Chevron. Warren Buffett has articulated many investing principles over the years, but one of the most important is investing in yourself. That includes investing the time to become a better investor. He also advocates other prudent financial practices, such as regular saving, not spending beyond your means, avoiding credit card debt, and reinvesting your profits. Beyond his value-oriented style, Buffett is also known as a buy-and-hold investor. He is not interested in selling stock in the near term to reap quick profits, but chooses stocks that he believes offer solid prospects for long-term growth. His record as an investor speaks for itself.

            "content": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning. When shorting equities, one often faces the challenge of distinguishing between a topping formation and a change in trend. Many successful short sellers will try to focus their efforts by looking at clues that are offered from the schools of technical analysis and fundamental analysis. Read on to find out how studying these different methods a trader can gain confidence in shorting the market. Since the equities markets are primarily dominated by long traders, short traders try to prey on the weak longs to trigger breaks and start downtrends. They try to put enough pressure on the market to create situations where the weaker long get out because of the fear of giving back gains. It is the job of the short seller to find tools, such as different chart patterns or indicators that are used specifically for predicting the start of a decline or a panic sell. Trying to short a market using technical analysis usually means finding an overbought indicator and a trend indicator that is reliable enough to show the equity is a candidate for a down move. The overbought indicator is most likely either a relative strength index (RSI) or a stochastic oscillator. A trend indicator can be as simple as a short-term moving average (MA). When using an oscillator, the trader is relying on it to show that the market has reached a level that indicates it may be running out of buyers. A trend indicator, on the other hand, is usually used to show that support has been broken because the market has become weak. When shorting an equity, it is very important that the trader knows that with an oscillator they are selling strength, but with a trend indicator, they are looking to short weakness. Fundamentally, there are several ways to pinpoint short candidates, including bad earnings, lawsuits, changes in legislation, and news. The key to using the fundamentals or news to trade equity on the short side is making an informed decision about whether the event taking place is a short-term issue or a long-term event. A negative news event is most likely to cause a spike down in a market and not necessarily set up good long-term decline. In this case, the spike has most likely been caused by stop-loss orders being triggered. A long-term decline can start with a spike down but is most likely triggered by a series of negative events that give traders confidence that a longer-term downtrend is developing. An example of a spike down triggered by a news event is when a company's earnings are reported lower than the consensus. Traders react by selling the stock. A series of negative earnings reports, however, is the type of fundamental that often attracts the short seller. When an event is significant enough to crack the support of a market, volatility will often increase as nervous long traders begin to feel the pressure of the short sellers trying to drive the market lower. This is when a trader can use both types of analysis to determine the severity of the decline that is in store. In general, a negative news announcement is often accompanied by heavy volume and wide ranges as short-selling pressure builds in an attempt to drive the stock to technical levels which will trigger more sell stops. The short seller, driven by the confidence of the negative fundamentals, continues to try to push the market through support points, which makes it painful to hold on to long positions. Heavy volume, wide ranges, and lower closes often catch the eye of short traders. Upon further investigation, the short trader will then decide that the news event or fundamental is strong enough to trigger a liquidation of long positions. These conditions may encourage short sellers to initiate new short positions. A good example of this kind of setup took place in the S&P Financial SPDR Fund (AMEX:XLF) back in early 2007. Figure 1 illustrates how short sellers identified a potential opportunity and used negative evidence from technical and fundamental analysis to take control of a falling market. Figure 1 (Source: TradeStation) Short sellers watched volume increase and eventually triggered a downside acceleration. After a prolonged move up and a series of higher tops and higher bottoms, the RSI and stochastic indicators reached overbought levels. This was enough information to cause traders to think a top was being formed, but not enough to attract any selling pressure because, throughout the up move, the same oscillators had indicated possible tops. The XLF offered the first clue of a top on Feb. 20, 2007, at 37.99, and began its break to 34.18 by March 14, 2007. This move was the largest down move in terms of price and time that the market had seen since 2004. Compared to previous breaks, this move was much more severe, which was a major clue that the XLF was topping seen in Figure 2. Figure 2 (Source: TradeStation) The severe break during February and March gave a clear indication that XLF was topping. While technical factors may have identified a possible top, news stories helped traders gain confidence in the short side by supplying the market with negativity. On Feb. 26, 2007, former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan warned of a recession by the end of 2007. The next day, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 8.8%. European stocks also experienced large one-day declines, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped sharply. During the course of these broad market breaks, XLF also attracted short-selling pressure as bearish traders interpreted this as a sign a recession could possibly cut into future earnings of financial institutions. The first move down was triggered by a combination of technical and fundamental factors. It offered clues to traders that the XLF was sensitive to the news which had a potential effect on futures earnings. It also identified price points in the market which may have been defended by long traders. During February and March, it was reported that several subprime businesses filed for bankruptcy. This news, along with Mr. Greenspan's comments, most likely contributed to the decline in XLF from Feb. 20 to March 14. As the market was forming its top in early spring, more fundamentally bearish data was released, which painted a grim picture when combined with the weakening technical setup. In early April, New Century Financial Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. While this news may not have immediately triggered a break in the market, when combined with the subprime bankruptcy filings in February and March, a bearish fundamental trend started to form. XLF showed a downward price trend throughout the spring and summer. During this time period, short sellers likely gained confidence from the unfavorable fundamentals, news stories, and the visibly bearish chart patterns. Short sellers were likely encouraged by the negatively-toned news stories which spread pessimism among investors. Meanwhile, the technical patterns on the charts kept reaffirming the downtrend with a series of lower tops and lower bottoms seen in Figure 3. Based on the combination of the technicals and fundamentals, it was clear that the short sellers were in control of XLF. Figure 3 (Source: TradeStation) The series of lower tops and lower bottoms indicate a clear downtrend throughout the spring and summer months. In summary, to be a successful short seller, one must be aware of the clues that are offered both technically and fundamentally. Technically, the short trader must be able to distinguish between a topping formation and a change in trend. They must learn the types of formations that indicate a short-term top or a long-term trend. Fundamentally, the short-trader has to distinguish between a one-time news event and the start of a series of negative events. By learning how both the technicals and fundamentals work together, a trader will gain confidence that can help one comfortably to go short in the market.

            "title": "Income Stock: What it is, How it Works, Example",
            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. An income stock is a security that pays regular, often steadily increasing, dividends. Income stocks usually offer a high yield that may generate the majority of the security's overall returns. While there is no specific breakpoint for classification, most income stocks have lower levels of volatility than the overall stock market, and offer sustainable, higher-than-average dividend yields. Income stocks may have limited future growth options, thereby requiring a lower level of ongoing capital investment. Any excess cash flow from profits can be directed back to investors on a regular basis. Income stocks can come from any industry, but investors commonly find them within real estate (through real estate investment trusts, or REITs), energy sectors, utilities, natural resources, and financial institutions. Many conservative investors seek income stocks because they want some exposure to corporate profit growth. At the same time, these stocks have steady streams of revenue that allow for a low risk and consistent source of revenue, perhaps for investors who are older and do not have regular salaries anymore. The ideal income stock would have very low volatility (as measured by its beta), a dividend yield higher than the prevailing 10-year Treasury note (T-note) rate, and a modest level of annual profit growth. Ideal income stocks would also show a history of increasing dividends on a regular basis so as to keep up with inflation, which eats away at future cash payments. Retail behemoth Walmart Inc. is an example of an income stock. As its stock price has risen over the last thirty years, the Arkansas-based company has consistently increased its dividend payout. The company's dividend yield peaked at 3.32% in 2015 and, as of July 16, 2021, is at 1.55%, which is superior to the yield on the 10-year T-note. It has achieved this yield despite the threat of e-commerce and increased competition from Amazon, which has taken away its market share. While many conservative investors target income stocks, those able and/or with the desire to take more risks are perhaps better off pursuing growth stocks. In contrast with income stocks, growth stocks usually do not pay dividends. Instead, company management often prefers to reinvest retained earnings into capital projects to boost future revenues and profit. For example, a recently public technology firm might choose to hire a new team of engineers or put all their efforts for one or two quarters into a new product rollout, which not only requires technical expertise but also marketing and sales power, along with significant customer experience to reply to questions and concerns and help with troubleshooting. While growth stocks can bring significant capital gains, they generally also carry more risk than income stocks. With growth stocks, shareholders must rely on the company's investments paying off to generate a return on their investment (ROI). If the company's growth is not as high as expected, shareholders may end up losing their money as market confidence wanes and share prices drop.

            "title": "Efficient Market Hypothesis: Is the Stock Market Efficient?",
            "content": "An important debate among investors is whether the stock market is efficient\u2014that is, whether it reflects all the information made available to market participants at any given time. The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) maintains that all stocks are perfectly priced according to their inherent investment properties, the knowledge of which all market participants possess equally. Financial theories are subjective. In other words, there are no proven laws in finance. Instead, ideas try to explain how the market works. Here, we take a look at where the efficient market hypothesis has fallen short in terms of explaining the stock market's behavior. While it may be easy to see a number of deficiencies in the theory, it's important to explore its relevance in the modern investing environment. There are three tenets to the efficient market hypothesis: the weak, the semi-strong, and the strong. The weak make the assumption that current stock prices reflect all available information. It goes further to say past performance is irrelevant to what the future holds for the stock. Therefore, it assumes that technical analysis can't be used to achieve returns. The semi-strong form of the theory contends stock prices are factored into all information that is publicly available. Therefore, investors can't use fundamental analysis to beat the market and make significant gains. In the strong form of the theory, all information\u2014both public and private\u2014are already factored into the stock prices. So it assumes no one has an advantage to the information available, whether that's someone on the inside or out. Therefore, it implies the market is perfect, and making excessive profits from the market is next to impossible. The EMH was developed from economist Eugene Fama's Ph.D. dissertation in the 1960s. While it may sound great, this theory is not without criticism. Other schools of thought, such as Alphanomics, argue that markets can be inefficient. First, the efficient market hypothesis assumes all investors perceive all available information in precisely the same manner. The different methods for analyzing and valuing stocks pose some problems for the validity of the EMH. If one investor looks for undervalued market opportunities while another evaluates a stock on the basis of its growth potential, these two investors will already have arrived at a different assessment of the stock's fair market value. Therefore, one argument against the EMH points out that since investors value stocks differently, it is impossible to determine what a stock should be worth in an efficient market. Proponents of the EMH conclude investors may profit from investing in a low-cost, passive portfolio. Secondly, no single investor is ever able to attain greater profitability than another with the same amount of invested funds under the efficient market hypothesis. Since they both have the same information, they can only achieve identical returns. But consider the wide range of investment returns attained by the entire universe of investors, investment funds, and so forth. If no investor had any clear advantage over another, would there be a range of yearly returns in the mutual fund industry, from significant losses to 50% profits or more? According to the EMH, if one investor is profitable, it means every investor is profitable. But this is far from true. Thirdly (and closely related to the second point), under the efficient market hypothesis, no investor should ever be able to beat the market or the average annual returns that all investors and funds are able to achieve using their best efforts. This would naturally imply, as many market experts often maintain, the absolute best investment strategy is simply to place all of one's investment funds into an index fund. This would increase or decrease according to the overall level of corporate profitability or losses. But there are many investors who have consistently beaten the market. Warren Buffett is one of those who's managed to outpace the averages year after year. Eugene Fama never imagined that his efficient market would be 100% efficient all the time. That would be impossible, as it takes time for stock prices to respond to new information. The efficient hypothesis, however, doesn't give a strict definition of how much time prices need to revert to fair value. Moreover, under an efficient market, random events are entirely acceptable, but will always be ironed out as prices revert to the norm. But it's important to ask whether EMH undermines itself by allowing random occurrences or environmental eventualities. There is no doubt that such eventualities must be considered under market efficiency but, by definition, true efficiency accounts for those factors immediately. In other words, prices should respond nearly instantaneously with the release of new information that can be expected to affect a stock's investment characteristics. So, if the EMH allows for inefficiencies, it may have to admit that absolute market efficiency is impossible. Although it's relatively easy to pour cold water on the efficient market hypothesis, its relevance may actually be growing. With the rise of computerized systems to analyze stock investments, trades, and corporations, investments are becoming increasingly automated on the basis of strict mathematical or fundamental analytical methods. Given the right power and speed, some computers can immediately process any and all available information, and even translate such analysis into an immediate trade execution. Despite the increasing use of computers, most decision-making is still done by human beings and is therefore subject to human error. Even at an institutional level, the use of analytical machines is anything but universal. While the success of stock market investing is based mostly on the skill of individual or institutional investors, people will continually search for the surefire method of achieving greater returns than the market averages. It's safe to say the market is not going to achieve perfect efficiency anytime soon. For greater efficiency to occur, all of these things must happen: It is hard to imagine even one of these criteria of market efficiency ever being met."

            "title": "Cyclical Stock: What It Is, Examples, Risk and Return Potential",
            "content": "The price of a cyclical stock is affected by macroeconomic or systematic changes in the overall economy. Cyclical stocks are known for following the cycles of an economy through expansion, peak, recession, and recovery. Most cyclical stocks involve companies that sell consumer discretionary items that consumers buy more during a booming economy but they spend less on them during a recession. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol Companies with cyclical stocks include car manufacturers, airlines, furniture retailers, clothing stores, hotels, and restaurants. Consumers can afford to buy new cars, upgrade their homes, shop,\u00a0and travel when the economy is doing well. These\u00a0discretionary expenses\u00a0are some of the first things consumers cut when an economy does poorly. Cyclical stocks can become completely worthless if a recession is severe enough and companies may go out of business. Investors should be careful about their positions in cyclical stocks but they shouldn't avoid them entirely. Cyclical stocks rise and fall with the economic cycle. This predictability in the movement of their prices can lead some investors to attempt to time the market. They\u00a0buy\u00a0the\u00a0shares at a low point in the business cycle and sell\u00a0them at a high point. Investors should use caution about the weight of cyclical stocks in their portfolios at any point in time but this doesn't mean investors should steer clear of these stocks completely. Cyclical stocks are seen as more volatile than noncyclical or\u00a0defensive stocks, which tend to be more stable during periods of economic weakness. However, they offer greater potential for growth because\u00a0they tend to outperform the market during periods of economic strength. Investors seeking long-term growth with managed volatility tend to balance their portfolios with a mix of cyclical stocks and defensive stocks. Investors frequently choose exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to gain exposure to cyclical stocks during expanding economic cycles. The SPDR ETF series offers one of the most popular cyclical ETF investments in the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Fund (XLY). The performance of cyclical stocks tends to correlate with the economy but the same can't be said about noncyclical stocks. These stocks tend to beat the market regardless of the economic trend, even when there's a slowdown in the economy. Noncyclical stocks are also referred to as defensive stocks. They encompass the\u00a0consumer staples category with goods and services that people continue buying through all types of business cycles, even economic\u00a0downturns. Companies that deal with food, gas, and water, such as Walmart, are examples of those that have noncyclical stocks. Adding noncyclical stocks to a portfolio can be a great strategy for investors because it helps hedge against losses sustained by cyclical companies during an economic slowdown. Cyclical stocks are often further delineated by\u00a0durables, nondurables, and services. Durable goods companies are involved in the manufacture or distribution of physical goods that have an expected life span of more than three years. Companies that operate in this segment include automakers such as Ford, appliance manufacturers like Whirlpool, and furniture makers such as Ethan Allen. The measure of durable goods orders is an\u00a0indicator of future economic performance. It may be an indication of stronger economic activity in the ensuing months when durable goods orders are up in a particular month. Nondurable goods companies produce or distribute soft goods that have an expected life span of fewer\u00a0than three years. Examples of companies that operate in this sector are Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble. Services is a separate category of cyclical stocks\u00a0because these companies don't manufacture or distribute physical goods. They instead provide services that facilitate travel, entertainment, and other leisure activities for consumers. Walt Disney (DIS) is one of the best-known companies operating in this space. Also falling into this category are companies that operate in the digital area of streaming media, such as Netflix (NFLX). A stock is essentially an ownership interest in a company. You own a small percentage of the enterprise when you purchase one or more of its stocks. You'll receive monetary dividends as payment when and if the company does well. You can use them to reinvest and purchase more shares or you can take dividends as cash payments. You can also sell your stocks. You'll have capital gains income if you can sell your shares for more than your investment in them, including any trading fees. The \"best\" of any type of stock is the one that most closely accommodates your goals and your risk tolerance. That said, numerous sources will rate individual stocks for you based on other factors. Yahoo Finance recommends cyclical stocks of companies with names that we're all familiar with, like Costco, Expedia, UPS, Airbnb, and Kohl's. As the term \"counter\" implies, a counter-cyclical stock is noncyclical. Its price is inclined to move in the opposite direction from that in which the economy appears to be headed. The prices of these stocks tend to go up when the economy is struggling and a recession is looming or has already begun. A cyclical stock moves in sync with trends in the economy. The price soars when the economy is flourishing, but it can just as easily tank in times of recession. These stocks tend to be companies that produce and sell products that are discretionary rather than necessary components of life. Think restaurant chains rather than groceries. Cyclical stocks tend to produce high returns but this is confined to times of economic strength. They'll tank when the economy struggles. They're volatile and should be balanced with noncyclical stocks in a portfolio.

            "title": "Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE): Definition, History, How It Works",
            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is the largest stock exchange in Japan, headquartered in its capital city of Tokyo. The Tokyo Stock Exchange was established on May 15, 1878. As of Sept. 14, 2021, the exchange had 3,784 listed companies. The TSE is run by the Japan Exchange Group and is home to the largest and best-known Japanese giants with a global presence\u2014including Toyota, Honda, and Mitsubishi. In addition, the TSE offers specific trading information, real-time and historical index quotes, market statistics, and information about and from specialists. Notably, the acronym TSE for the Tokyo Stock Exchange should not be confused with Canada's Toronto Stock Exchange, which is known by the acronym TSX. At the peak of the Japanese asset price bubble in Dec.\u00a01989, the Nikkei 225 index reached a record high of 38,916. Following this, the TSE's combined market capitalization shrank dramatically over the next two decades, as the Japanese economy struggled with a recessionary environment and the Nikkei plunged in value. As of Sept. 2021, the board members of the Tokyo Stock Exchange are Director(Chairperson of the Board) Tsuda Hiroki; Director & Representative Executive Officer, Group CEO Kiyota Akira; Director & Representative Executive Officer, Group COO Yamaji Hiromi; and Directors Iwanaga Moriyuki and Shizuka Masaki. The five largest stocks by market capitalization listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as of the end of July 2021 were (in 100 millions of Japanese yen): When the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) first opened in 1878, some of its first customers were former samurai, who needed a market to trade bonds that had been issued to them by the government. In addition to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, other major trading exchanges worldwide include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Nasdaq, and the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Each exchange has specific listing requirements that owners must meet prior to offering their securities for trading. In general, these requirements include regular financial reports, such as audited earning reports, and minimum capital requirements. For example, the NYSE has a key listing requirement that stipulates a company must have at least 1.1 million publicly traded shares of stock with a stock price of at least $4 per share. The company must have an aggregate pre-tax income of $10 million for the previous three fiscal years, with at least $2 million in each of the most recent two fiscal years. Nasdaq requires listers to meet aggregate pre-tax income in the prior three fiscal years of at least $11 million and a minimum bid price of $4. Some market participants have complained that over the years the TSE has become too large and complicated compared to other global exchanges. The TSE consists of five sections. The first section lists Japan's biggest companies and the second section lists medium-sized companies. Combined, these two sections are called the \"main markets.\" Then there are two sections dedicated to startups. These sections are called the \"Mothers\" (Market of the High-Growth and Emerging Stocks) and the Jasdaq (which is separated further into standard and growth sub-sections). The final section is the Tokyo Pro Market, which is for professional investors only. To complicate matters, each of these TSE sections has its own listing requirements. As of Sept. 14, 2021, the first section alone included about 2,190 companies, almost double the level from 1990. A plan to reform the TSE includes simplifying the criteria separating the sections and reducing the number of sections to three\u2014Prime, Standard, and Growth. Another possible change includes increasing the market cap requirement to reduce the number of companies listed in the top tier.

            "title": "Preference Shares: Advantages and Disadvantages",
            "content": "Preference Shares: Advantages and Disadvantages Preference shares, which are issued by companies seeking to raise capital, combine the characteristics of debt and equity investments, and are consequently considered to be hybrid securities. Preference shareholders experience both advantages and disadvantages. On the upside, they collect dividend payments before common stock shareholders receive such income. But on the downside, they do not enjoy the voting rights that common shareholders typically do. Owners of preference shares receive fixed dividends, well before common shareholders see any money. In either case, dividends are only paid if the company turns a profit. But there is a wrinkle to this situation because a type of preference shares known as cumulative shares allow for the accumulation of unpaid dividends that must be paid out at a later date. So, once a struggling business finally rebounds and is back in the black, those unpaid dividends are remitted to preferred shareholders before any dividends can be paid to common shareholders. In the event that a company experiences a bankruptcy and subsequent liquidation, preferred shareholders have a higher claim on company assets than common shareholders do. Not surprisingly, preference shares attract conservative investors, who enjoy the comfort of the downside risk protection baked into these investments. A subcategory of preference shares known as convertible shares lets investors trade in these types of preference shares for a fixed number of common shares, which can be lucrative if the value of common shares begins climbing. Such participating shares let investors reap additional dividends that are above the fixed rate if the company meets certain predetermined profit targets. The main disadvantage of owning preference shares is that the investors in these vehicles don't enjoy the same voting rights as common shareholders. This means that the company is not beholden to preferred shareholders the way it is to traditional equity shareholders. Although the guaranteed return on investment makes up for this shortcoming, if interest rates rise, the fixed dividend that once seemed so lucrative can dwindle. This could cause buyer's remorse with preference shareholder investors, who may realize that they would have fared better with higher interest fixed-income securities. Financing through shareholder equity, either with common or preferred shares, lowers a company's debt-to-equity ratio, which is a sign of a well-managed business. Preference shares benefit issuing companies in several ways. The aforementioned lack of voter rights for preference shareholders places the company in a strength position by letting it retain more control. Furthermore, companies can issue callable preference shares, which affords them the right to repurchase shares at their discretion. This means that if callable shares are issued with a 6% dividend but interest rates fall to 4%, then a company can purchase any outstanding shares at the market price, then reissue those shares with a lower dividend rate. This ultimately reduces the cost of capital. Of course, this same flexibility is a disadvantage to shareholders.

            "title": "Issued Share vs. Subscribed Share Capital: What's the Difference?",
            "content": "Share capital refers to the amount of funding a company raises through the sale of stock to public investors. This means the company grants shareholders a small ownership stake in the company in exchange for monetary investment. Share capital constitutes the main source of equity financing and can be generated through the sale of common or preferred shares. Common stock is what most people think of when they talk about the stock market. Common, or ordinary, shareholders have voting rights and participate in major company decisions. Although companies at times pay dividends on common shares, they are not required to pay them. Preferred shares, also called preference shares, do not entail the same kinds of ownership rights as common shares. However, they generally include a guaranteed dividend each year that must be paid before any dividends can be distributed to common shareholders. In short, though preferred shareholders have fewer rights, they do have a higher claim on company assets. Although share capital refers to a dollar amount, it is dictated by the number and selling price of a company's shares. For example, if a company issues 1,000 shares for $25 per share, it generates $25,000 in share capital. Share capital is only generated by the initial sale of shares by the company to investors. If the investor goes on to trade those shares to a third party, any profit made on the sale does not contribute to the issuing company's share capital. Issued shares are the shares sold to and held by company investors. These investors can include large institutions or individual retail investors. Sometimes, large institutional purchases of shares may only be partially paid for and will be accounted as called-up share capital. The amount already received in payment is the paid-up share capital. When fully paid, the amount is recorded as paid-in share capital. Issued share capital is simply the monetary value of the shares of stock a company actually offers for sale to investors. The number of issued shares generally corresponds to the amount of subscribed share capital, though neither amount can exceed the authorized amount. When a company prepares to \"go public\" by issuing stock for the first time, investors can submit an application expressing their desire to participate. Subscribed shares are shares that investors have promised to buy. These shares are usually subscribed as part of an initial public offering (IPO). Underwriters often promise to deliver a certain number of subscribed shares prior to the IPO. The subscribers are usually large institutional investors and banks. Subscribed share capital refers to the monetary value of all the shares for which investors have expressed an interest. Share capital can fall into one of several other categories, depending on where the company is in the equity-raising process. They include the following: The maximum amount of share capital a company is allowed to raise is called its authorized capital. Though this does not limit the number of shares a company may issue, it does put a ceiling on the total amount of money that can be raised by the sale of those shares. Depending on the business and applicable regulations, companies may issue stock to investors with the understanding the investors will pay at a later date. Any funds due for shares issued but not fully paid for are called-up share capital. Any funds remitted for shares are considered as paid-up capital. Other types of capital, such as debt financing or mezzanine financing, are not considered share capital. Debt capital includes financing sources such as lines of credit, business loans, and credit card balances. While mezzanine financing, like share capital, is included under the equity section of the balance sheet, it is not considered share capital.

Major stock exchanges, like the Nasdaq, are exclusive clubs\u2014their reputations rest on the companies they trade. As such, the Nasdaq won't allow just any company to be traded on its exchange. Only companies with a solid history and top-notch management behind them are considered. The Nasdaq has four\u00a0sets of listing requirements. Each company must meet at least one of the four\u00a0requirement sets, as well as the main rules for all companies. Each listing firm must adhere to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Marketplace Rules for Nasdaq listings, including corporate governance rules 4350, 4351, and 4360. The regular bid price of shares of the company's stock at the time of listing must be at least $4.00; however, a company may qualify under a closing price alternative of $3.00 or $2.00 if the company meets varying requirements. Typically, there must be at least three (or four depending on the criteria) market makers for the stock. Companies must have a minimum of 1,250,000 publicly traded shares outstanding upon listing, excluding those held by officers, directors, or any beneficial owners of more than 10% of the company. To stay listed on the Nasdaq, a company must continue to meet the minimum listing requirements or risk being delisted and removed from the Nasdaq exchange. Companies must also have at least 450 round lot (i.e., 100 shares or more) shareholders, 2,200 total shareholders, or 550 total shareholders with 1.1 million average trading volume over the past 12 months. Depending on the types of securities listed and the company's size, an application fee of $5,000 to $25,000 is required. Companies must also pay an entry fee, which can range from $50,000 to $270,000. There are also fees depending on the number of shares listed, which range from $100,000 to $150,000. There are also several other fees, depending on the type of company, including an annual listing fee, small-cap fee for smaller companies, and fees for additional services or changes such as record-keeping and additional shares issued. In addition to the above requirements, financial standards need to be met, depending on the type of security being listed, which are outlined below. The company must have aggregate pre-tax earnings in the prior three years of at least $11 million, in the previous two years at least $2.2 million, and no single\u00a0year in the prior three years can have a net loss. The company must have a minimum aggregate cash flow of at least $27.5 million for the past three fiscal years, with no negative cash flow in any of those three years. Also, its average market capitalization over the prior 12 months must be at least $550 million, and revenues in the previous fiscal year must be $110 million, minimum. Companies can be removed from the cash flow requirement of the second standard if their\u00a0average market capitalization over the past 12 months is at least $850 million and revenues over the prior fiscal year are at least $90 million. Companies can eliminate the cash flow and revenue requirements and decrease their market capitalization requirements to $160 million if their total assets total at least $80 million and their stockholders' equity is at least $55 million. As of July 2023, there are over 3,300 companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange. The exchange has the highest trading volume of any U.S. exchange with approximately 1.8 billion trades per day. Many of today's famous companies, which are primarily technology companies, are listed on the Nasdaq. These companies include Apple, Microsoft, Meta (Facebook), Tesla, Amazon, Intel, Netflix, and Alphabet (Google). Famous non-tech companies include Costco, PepsiCo, and Starbucks. Yes, companies can be listed on more than one exchange, known as a dual listing. In order to do so, a company must meet all of the listing requirements of each exchange. Companies, however, don't usually do this. A company has four\u00a0ways to get listed on the Nasdaq, depending on the company's underlying fundamentals. If a company does not meet specific criteria, such as the operating income minimum, it has to make it up with larger minimum amounts in another area, like revenue. This helps to improve the quality of companies listed on the exchange. After a company gets listed on the market, it must maintain certain standards to continue trading. Failure to meet the specifications set out by the stock exchange will result in its delisting. Falling below the minimum required share price or market capitalization is one of the major factors triggering a delisting. The exact details of a delisting depend on the exchange.

            "title": "Understanding Small-Cap and Big-Cap Stocks",
            "content": "The meanings of big-cap and small-cap are generally understood by their names, which indicate how valuable they are in terms of market capitalization. Big-cap stocks\u2014also referred to as large-cap stocks\u2014are shares of larger companies. Small-cap stocks, on the other hand, are shares of smaller companies. Labels like these can often be misleading because many people run under the assumption that they can only make money by investing in large-cap stocks. And that can't be further from the truth\u2014especially nowadays. If you don't realize how big small-cap stocks have become, you could miss some potentially promising investment opportunities. Small-cap stocks are often attractive due to their lower relative valuations and potential to grow into big-cap stocks eventually, but the dollar-amount definition of a small-cap has changed over time. What was once considered a big-cap stock in previous decades may be thought of as a small-cap stock today. This article will define the caps and provide additional information to help investors understand terms that are often taken for granted. Before we do anything else, we first need to define the word cap\u2014which is short for capitalization. The term in its entirety, though, is market capitalization or market cap. This is the market's estimate of the total dollar value of a company's outstanding shares. To get this figure, you need to multiply the price of a stock by the number of shares outstanding. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that though this is the common conception of market capitalization, you actually need to add the market value of any of the company's publicly traded bonds to calculate the total market value of a company. The market cap shows the size of the company, which is something of interest to most investors. That's because it generally points out several of a company's key characteristics, including its risk assessment. Although the value of small-cap stocks may vary from broker to broker, the general consensus today is that they have market caps ranging from $250 million to $2 billion. One misconception people have about small-caps is that they are startup companies or are just brand-new entities that are breaking out. But many small-cap companies are just like their larger counterparts in that they have strong track records, are well established, and have great financials. And because they are smaller, small-cap share prices have a greater chance of growth. This means they have more potential for investors to earn money faster. In general, small-cap stocks are thought to be more volatile than big-cap stocks and thus provide both greater risk but also opportunity. This is because big-cap stocks are often larger, more mature companies that are not seeking aggressive growth. Big-cap stocks refer to the largest publicly traded companies, with market caps of more than $10 billion, like General Electric and Walmart. These companies are also called blue-chip stocks\u2014companies with a history of dependable earnings, solid reputations, and strong financials. Some examples of blue-chip stocks are IBM Corp., Microsoft, Coca-Cola Co., and Boeing Co. Though companies like these tend to perform well and provide safe returns for investors, you should not see this as a blanket expectation for all large-caps. In general, big-cap stocks are established, mature, and stable. They tend to be less volatile and reward investors with stable and growing dividend streams. However, some investors have the misconception that the large-cap moniker means there is no risk at all. There have been several cases in financial history that point to the opposite. Enron is just one example. It serves to demonstrate that the bigger they are, the harder they fall. The company, which was a darling of the energy industry, was the subject of an accounting scandal. The company used mark to market (MTM) accounting to make the company look like it was much more profitable than it actually was. Its subsidiaries were losing money, but the company continued to hide its losses and debt, using off-balance-sheet entities to mask toxic assets. The company buckled and ended up filing for bankruptcy. Key personnel, including CEO Jeffrey Skilling and the company's accounting firm, faced criminal charges. The lesson? Just because it's a large-cap doesn't mean it's always a great investment. You still have to do your research, which means looking at other, smaller companies that can provide you with a great basis for your overall investment portfolio. Dow vs. Nasdaq: The average market cap for the Dow remains much larger than the average market cap for the Nasdaq 100. Small-cap stocks, as the name implies, are far smaller in terms of market valuation\u2014but also, generally, scale, scope, and influence. These companies have a market cap of $250 million to $2 billion and are found in all business types, economic sectors, and growth phases. One common misconception about small-caps is that they are\u00a0startups\u00a0or brand-new companies. In reality, many small-cap companies are well-established businesses with strong track records and great financials. And because they are smaller, small-cap share prices have a greater chance of growth. Historically, small-cap stocks may have outperformed large-cap stocks. However, whether smaller or larger companies perform better varies over time from period to period based on other factors like the broader economic climate. For instance, big-caps seem to hold their own better during bear markets and recessions. At the same time, small-cap stocks tend to be more volatile (and thus riskier) than their larger-cap peers. It often takes less trading\u00a0volume\u00a0to move their prices, and it is common for a small-cap stock's price to fluctuate more in a single trading day than those of larger companies. That is something that many investors simply cannot stomach, but it does attract more active traders like day traders. Note that because these stocks often have less\u00a0liquidity, it is also more difficult to exit a position at the market price. The definitions of big- or large-cap and small-cap stocks differ slightly from one brokerage company to the next and have changed over time. The differences between the brokerage definitions are relatively superficial and only matter for the companies that lie on their edges. The classifications are important for borderline companies because mutual funds use these definitions to determine which stocks to buy. The current approximate definitions are as follows: These categories have increased over time along with the market indexes. And it is important to note that these definitions are fluid and not fixed\u2014they are relative. For example, in several circles, stocks with market caps greater than $100 billion are seen as mega-caps. Remember market capitalization is based on the stock price and therefore the perceived value of a company, not the actual value. The big-cap stocks get most of Wall Street's attention because that's where you'll find the lucrative investment banking business. Large-cap stocks make up the majority of the equity market in the United States, which is why they make up the nuclei of many investors' portfolios. Mega-cap stocks, on the other hand, tend to shift in numbers. There were at least 7 of these stocks in existence in 2007, but that number shrunk by 2010 due to the 2008 mortgage meltdown and the Great Recession. In the years since, mega-cap stocks have made a resurgence, and behemoths such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have reached historic market-cap highs approaching $2 trillion each. As of 2022, the total number of mega-cap companies around the world is around 48. But what about small-caps? Remember, just because they have a smaller market cap doesn't mean you won't find value or great returns. In fact, you can find much of the value in the stock market in small-cap stocks because some of them have some of the strongest track records around. Aside from having a market capitalization of $10 billion or more, large-cap stocks also tend to be those of older, more mature corporations. These companies may be more likely to pay regular dividends to their shareholders because they see\u00a0stable, established sources of income and profitability. Large-caps are typically market leaders and household names, many of which are also blue-chip stocks. Small-cap stocks can be great growth opportunities, but investors should also be aware of the risks associated with smaller companies' stocks. First, they tend to be more volatile, meaning that price swings and drawdowns can be larger than with bigger companies' stocks. These shares may also be less liquid and more thinly traded, with larger bid-ask spreads, making it more costly to enter and exit positions.  At the company level, smaller companies may have a harder time accessing funding or raising capital than larger companies do. This can be a limiting factor for operations and growth. If you want to invest in big-caps, you can look to index funds or ETFs that track indexes such as the S&P 500 (the 500 largest companies in the U.S.) or the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which covers 30 blue-chip stocks. If you want to invest in small-caps, you can look to index funds or ETFs that track indexes such as the Russell 2000 Index or the S&P Small-Cap 600. This will depend on the type of investor you are. If you have a greater risk tolerance and longer time horizons, small-cap stocks tend to outperform big-caps over time because they are able to grow more rapidly than larger companies. If you prefer stable appreciation and dividend income, big-caps may be more suitable. In general, investors are encouraged to diversify and hold a mix of stocks containing both large and small companies. The big and small labels are also attached to the major stock exchanges and indexes, which also leads to confusion. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is viewed as consisting of only big-cap stocks while the Nasdaq is often viewed as being comprised of small-cap stocks. These perceptions were generally true before 1990, but have since changed. Since the tech boom, the market caps of the stock exchanges and indexes vary and overlap. Labels such as big and small are subjective, relative, and change over time. Big does not always mean less risky, but the big-caps are the stocks most closely followed by Wall Street analysts. This attention, however, generally means that there are no value plays in the big-cap arena.

            "title": "Adjusted Closing Price: How It Works, Types, Pros & Cons",
            "content": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). The adjusted closing price amends a stock's closing price to reflect that stock's value after accounting for any corporate actions. It is often used when examining historical returns or doing a detailed analysis of past performance. Stock values are stated in terms of the closing price and the adjusted closing price. The closing price is the raw price, which is just the cash value of the last transacted price before the market closes. The adjusted closing price factors in anything that might affect the stock price after the market closes. A stock's price is typically affected by the supply and demand of market participants. However, some corporate actions, such as stock splits, dividends, and rights offerings, affect a stock's price. Adjustments allow investors to obtain an accurate record of the stock's performance. Investors should understand how corporate actions are accounted for in a stock's adjusted closing price. It is especially useful when examining historical returns because it gives analysts an accurate representation of the firm's equity value. A stock split is a corporate action intended to make the firm\u2019s shares more affordable for average investors. A stock split does not change a company's total market capitalization, but it does affect the company's stock price. For example, a company's board of directors may decide to split the company's stock 3-for-1. Therefore, the company's shares outstanding increase by a multiple of three, while its share price is divided by three. Suppose a stock closed at $300 the day before its stock split. In this case, the closing price is adjusted to $100 ($300 divided by 3) per share to maintain a consistent standard of comparison. Similarly, all other previous closing prices for that company would be divided by three to obtain the adjusted closing prices. Common distributions that affect a stock's price include cash dividends and stock dividends. The difference between cash dividends and stock dividends is that shareholders are entitled to a predetermined price per share and additional shares, respectively. For example, assume a company declared a $1 cash dividend and was trading at $51 per share before then. All other things being equal, the stock price would fall to $50 because that $1 per share is no longer part of the company's assets. However, the dividends are still part of the investor's returns. By subtracting dividends from previous stock prices, we obtain the adjusted closing prices and a better picture of returns. A stock's adjusted closing price also reflects rights offerings that may occur. A rights offering is an issue of rights given to existing shareholders, which entitles the shareholders to subscribe to the rights issue in proportion to their shares. That will lower the value of existing shares because supply increases have a dilutive effect on the existing shares. For example, assume a company declares a rights offering, in which existing shareholders are entitled to one additional share for every two shares owned. Assume the stock is trading at $50, and existing shareholders can purchase additional shares at a subscription price of $45. After the rights offering, the adjusted closing price is calculated based on the adjusting factor and the closing price. The main advantage of adjusted closing prices is that they make it easier to evaluate stock performance. Firstly, the adjusted closing price helps investors understand how much they would have made by investing in a given asset. Most obviously, a 2-for-1 stock split does not cause investors to lose half their money. Since successful stocks often split repeatedly, graphs of their performance would be hard to interpret without adjusted closing prices. Secondly, the adjusted closing price allows investors to compare the performance of two or more assets. Aside from the clear issues with stock splits, failing to account for dividends tends to understate the profitability of value stocks and dividend growth stocks. Using the adjusted closing price is also essential when comparing the returns of different asset classes over the long term. For example, the prices of high-yield bonds tend to fall in the long run. That does not mean these bonds are necessarily poor investments. Their high yields offset the losses and more, which can be seen by looking at the adjusted closing prices of high-yield bond funds. The adjusted closing price provides the most accurate record of returns for long-term investors looking to design asset allocations. The nominal closing price of a stock or other asset can convey useful information. This information is destroyed by converting that price into an adjusted closing price. In actual practice, many speculators place buy and sell orders at certain prices, such as $100. As a result, a sort of tug of war can take place between bulls and bears at these key prices. If the bulls win, a breakout may occur and send the asset price soaring. Similarly, a win for the bears can lead to a breakdown and further losses. The adjusted close stock price obscures these events. By looking at the actual closing price at the time, investors can get a better idea of what was going on and understand contemporary accounts. If investors look at historical records, they will find many examples of tremendous public interest in nominal levels. Perhaps the most famous is the role that Dow 1,000 played in the 1966 to 1982 secular bear market. During that period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) repeatedly hit 1,000, only to fall back shortly after that. The breakout finally took place in 1982, and the Dow never dropped below 1,000 again.\ufeff\ufeff This phenomenon is covered up somewhat by adding dividends to obtain the adjusted closing prices. In general, adjusted closing prices are less useful for more speculative stocks. Jesse Livermore provided an excellent account of the impact of key nominal prices, such as $100 and $300, on Anaconda Copper in the early 20th century. In the early 21st century, similar patterns occurred with Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla (TSLA). William J. O'Neil gave examples where stock splits, far from being irrelevant, marked the beginnings of real declines in the stock price.\ufeff\ufeff While arguably irrational, the impact of nominal prices on stocks could be an example of a self-fulfilling prophecy.

            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. The basic materials sector is an industry category made up of businesses engaged in the discovery, development, and processing of raw materials. The sector includes companies engaged in mining and metal refining, chemical products,\u00a0and forestry products. Within this sector are the companies that\u00a0supply\u00a0most of the materials used in construction. That makes the companies and their stocks sensitive to changes in the business cycle. They tend to thrive when the economy is strong. The category is sometimes referred to simply as the materials sector. Companies in the basic materials sector are involved in the physical acquisition, development, and initial processing of the many products commonly referred to as raw materials. Oil, gold, and stone are examples. For the most part, raw materials are naturally occurring resources. Some are considered finite. That is, it takes millions of years for them to develop, well outside the long-range plans of any company. Others are reusable but are not available in infinite quantities at any given point in time. For the purposes of stock categorization, the most common materials within the sector are mined products, such as metals and ore, and forestry products, or lumber. The stocks of certain chemical producers and energy sources also are included in the basic materials sector. Containers and packaging are categorized as basic materials, whether they're made of glass, metal, or cardboard. Not all businesses that work with basic materials are included in the sector. For example, while a metal mining company is considered a basic materials processor, a jewelry company, even one which works only with mined metal, is not. It is deemed a retailer or a wholesaler who is a buyer of the basic material. Not even all chemicals qualify as basic materials. For example, industrial fertilizers and paint additives are categorized as complex cleaning products or pharmaceuticals. More than 200 mutual funds, index funds, and ETFs focus their investments in the basic materials sector. Certain energy sources, notably natural gas, are considered basic materials. Crude oil and coal qualify in their natural state\u00a0as do some refined products such as gasoline. The refined versions of these products are included because the demand for them is nearly universal. They are critical to the operation of almost every industry. The basic materials sector is subject to the law of supply and demand in the same way as consumer goods are. In fact, they are closely interrelated. If the demand for consumer goods drops, the demand for the raw materials involved in their production also drops. The basic materials sector also is affected by shifts in the housing market\u00a0as many raw materials are finished in order to be used in construction projects. If new housing development slows, the demand for lumber products decreases. Three of the biggest American companies are included in the basic materials sector, and all three are involved in the oil business. These are Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., and the oil field services company Schlumberger Ltd. DuPont de Nemours and Co. and Monsanto Co., both chemicals companies, are listed in this sector. So are two big producers of construction materials, Vulcan Materials Co., a producer of crushed stone, gravel, and concrete, and Steel Dynamics Inc., a maker of finished steel products. More than 300 stock mutual funds, index funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focus on investments in the basic materials sector.\ufeff\ufeff The many ETFs include Vanguard's Vanguard Materials ETF, Blackrock's iShares Global Materials ETF, and iShares U.S. Basic Materials ETF.\ufeff\ufeff \ufeff\ufeff \ufeff\ufeff Mutual funds in the sector sometimes focus narrowly on one segment, such as the Fidelity Select Chemicals Fund and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF.\ufeff\ufeff \ufeff\ufeff Morningstar. \"Basic Materials Stocks.\" Accessed Sept. 2, 2020. iShares by BlackRock. \"iShares U.S. Basic Materials ETF.\" Accessed Sept. 2, 2020. iShares by BlackRock. \"iShares Global Materials ETF.\" Accessed Sept. 2, 2020.

            "title": "Clientele Effect: Definition, Theory, Examples",
            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. The clientele effect explains the movement in a company's stock price according to the demands and goals of its investors. These investor demands come in reaction to a tax, dividend, or other policy change or corporate action which affects a company's shares. The clientele effect assumes that specific investors are preliminarily attracted to different company policies,\u00a0and that when a company alters one or more such policies they will adjust their stock holdings accordingly. As a result of this adjustment, stock prices can fluctuate. The clientele effect is a change in share price due to corporate decision-making that triggers investors' reactions. A change in policy that is viewed by shareholders as unfavorable may cause them to sell some or all of their holdings, depressing the share price. Large policy shifts can be disruptive for both the company\u2019s long-term interests, as well as shareholders\u2019\u00a0portfolios. Once a company establishes a policy pattern and attracts a given clientele, it is generally best not to tinker with it too much. There is a good deal of controversy about whether the clientele effect is a real phenomenon in the markets. Some believe that it takes more factors than just the wishes of a company\u2019s\u00a0clientele to move a stock\u2019s price greatly.\u00a0Moreover, even though investors could switch to companies that offered the profile they desired, such changes could entail transaction fees, taxable events, and other costs. Public equities are typically\u00a0categorized either as dividend-paying securities or not. Each of these categories links to a specific age in the lifecycle of a business as it matures. For example, high-growth stocks traditionally do not pay dividends. However, they are more likely to exhibit substantial price appreciation as the company grows. On the other hand, dividend-paying stocks tend to show smaller movements in capital gains but reward investors with stable, periodic dividends. Shareholders in a dividend clientele generally base their preferences for a particular\u00a0dividend payout ratio\u00a0on comparable income level, personal income tax considerations, or their age. The clientele effect is often connected with dividend rates and payouts by a company. Some investors, like the legendary Warren Buffett, seek investment opportunities in high-dividend stocks. Others, such as technology investors, often seek out high-growth companies with the potential for extravagant capital gains. Thus, the effect first outlines the way in which the company's maturity and business operations initially attract\u00a0a specific investor type. The second facet of the clientele effect describes how current investors react to substantial changes in a company's policies. For example, if a public technology stock pays no dividends and reinvests all of its profits back into its operations, it initially attracts growth investors. However, if the company\u00a0stops reinvesting in its growth and instead begins channeling money to dividend payouts, high-growth investors may be inclined to exit their positions and seek other opportunities that better match their needs. Dividend-seeking income investors may now view the company as an attractive investment. Consider a company that already pays dividends and has consequently attracted clientele seeking high dividend-paying stocks. If the company should experience a downturn or elects to decrease its dividend offerings, the dividend investors may sell their stock and reinvest the proceeds in another company paying higher returns. As a result of a sell-off, the company's share price is apt to decline. In 2016, the CEO of Northwestern Mutual publicly announced in a press release a 45-basis-point drop in the dividend scale interest rate. This decision proved to impact the company\u2019s dividend policy negatively. Following the disclosed plans, the company depressed its dividend rate from 5.45% to 5.00%. Meanwhile, in 2001, Winn-Dixie slashed its dividend and altered its payment structure, opting to distribute income quarterly in arrears instead of monthly in advance. Its shareholders, many of which valued the regular\u00a0current income, were not happy, and the stock tanked. Some experts see this as the clientele effect in action.

Investopedia / Michela Buttignol A depositary receipt (DR) is a negotiable certificate issued by a bank. It represents shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange and gives investors the opportunity to hold shares in the equity of foreign countries. It gives them an alternative to trading on an international market. A depositary receipt was originally a physical certificate that allowed investors to hold shares in the equity of other countries. One of the most common types of DRs is the\u00a0American depositary receipt\u00a0(ADR), which has been offering companies, investors, and traders global investment opportunities since the 1920s. A depositary receipt allows investors to hold shares in stocks of companies that are listed on exchanges in foreign countries. A depositary receipt avoids the need to trade directly with the stock exchange in the foreign market. Investors instead transact with a major financial institution within their home country. This typically reduces fees and is far more convenient than purchasing stocks directly in foreign markets. Investors can gain access to foreign stocks via American depositary receipts (ADRs) in the United States. ADRs\u00a0are issued only by U.S. banks for foreign stocks that are traded on a U.S. exchange, including the American Stock Exchange (AMEX), NYSE, or Nasdaq. The receipt is listed in U.S. dollars when an investor purchases an American depositary receipt. A U.S. financial institution overseas rather than a global institution holds the actual underlying security. ADRs are a great way to buy shares in a foreign company while earning capital gains\u00a0and possibly being paid dividends, which are cash payments by the companies to shareholders. Both capital gains and dividends are paid in U.S. dollars. ADR holders don't have to transact in foreign\u00a0currencies because ADRs trade in U.S. dollars and clear through U.S. settlement systems. The U.S. banks require that the foreign companies provide them with detailed financial information, making it easier for investors to assess the company's financial health compared to a foreign company that only transacts on international exchanges. ICICI Bank Ltd. is listed in India and is typically unavailable to foreign investors. But ICICI Bank has an American depositary receipt issued by Deutsche Bank that trades on the NYSE, which most U.S. investors can access. This provides it with much wider availability among investors.

Depositary receipts have spread to other parts of the globe in the form of\u00a0global depositary receipts\u00a0(GDRs), European DRs, and\u00a0international DRs. ADRs are traded on a U.S. national stock exchange, but GDRs are commonly listed on European stock exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange. Both ADRs and GDRs are usually denominated in U.S. dollars, but they can also be denominated in euros. A GDR works similarly to an ADR but in reverse. A U.S.-based company that wants its stock to be listed on the London Stock Exchange can accomplish this via a GDR. The U.S.-based company enters into a depositary receipt agreement with the London depository bank. In turn, the London bank issues shares in Britain based on the regulatory compliance for both countries. Depositary receipts can be attractive to investors because they allow them to diversify their portfolios and purchase shares in foreign companies. Diversification is an investment strategy in which a portfolio is constructed so it contains a wide variety of stocks in multiple industries. Diversifying using depository receipts along with other investments prevents a portfolio from being too heavily concentrated in one holding or sector. Depositary receipts provide investors with the benefits and rights of the underlying shares, which can include voting rights and dividends. They can open up markets that investors wouldn't have access to otherwise. Depositary receipts are more convenient and less expensive than purchasing stocks in foreign markets. ADRs help reduce the administration and duty costs that would otherwise be levied on each transaction. Depositary receipts help international companies raise capital globally and encourage international investment. One of the disadvantages of depository receipts is that investors may find that many aren't listed on a stock exchange. They may only have institutional investors trading them. Another potential downside to depositary receipts is their relatively low liquidity. There aren't many buyers and sellers, and this can lead to delays in entering and exiting a position. They may also come with significant administrative\u00a0fees in some cases. Depositary receipts such as ADRs don't eliminate currency risk for the underlying shares in another country. Dividend payments in euros are converted to U.S. dollars, net of conversion expenses and foreign taxes. The conversion is done in accordance with the deposit agreement. Fluctuations in the exchange rate could impact the value of the dividend payment. Investors still face economic risks because the country in which the foreign company is located could experience a recession, bank failures, or political upheaval. The value of depository receipt would fluctuate as a result, along with any heightened risks in the foreign county. There are also risks with attending securities that aren't backed by a company. The depositary receipt may be withdrawn at any time, and the waiting period for the shares being sold and the proceeds distributed to investors can be long. A foreign-listed company typically hires a\u00a0financial advisor\u00a0to help it navigate regulations when it wants to create a depositary receipt abroad. The company also generally uses a domestic bank to act as the custodian and a\u00a0broker\u00a0in the target country. The domestic bank will list shares of the firm on an exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),\u00a0in the country where the firm is located. Dividends and gains earned on American depositary receipts are paid in U.S. dollars, net of expenses and foreign taxes. Most banks withhold to cover foreign taxes, but the full income is still reportable and potentially taxable on your U.S. tax return, potentially resulting in double taxation unless steps are taken to prevent this. A depositary bank works with a foreign company and its custodian bank with a sponsored American depositary receipt. ADRs are otherwise issued by brokers or dealers that own common stock in the foreign company. Unsponsored ADRs aren't commonly available on exchanges. You can avoid trading directly with foreign stock exchanges by purchasing depositary receipts, but DRs come with both pros and cons. They're convenient, and they can be less expensive than trading directly because the fees are often reduced. But your investment can be impacted by economic risks and circumstances in the foreign country, and DRs aren't particularly liquid. Trades you make can be subject to some delays, so you'll want to be sure that you can weather these circumstances. J.P.

Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master's in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology.

Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. A dual class stock is when a company issues two share classes. A dual class stock structure can consist of Class A and Class B shares, for example. These shares can differ in terms of voting rights and dividend payments. When multiple share classes of stock are issued, typically one class is offered to the general public, while the other is offered to company founders, executives, and family. The class offered to the general public often has limited or no voting rights, while the class available to founders and executives has more voting power and often provides for majority control of the company. Dual class stock is designed to give specific shareholders voting control. Classes of stock with unequal\u00a0voting shares\u00a0may be created to satisfy owners who don't want to give up control, but do want the public\u00a0equity market\u00a0to provide financing. In most cases, these so-called super-voting shares are not publicly traded and company founders and their families are most commonly the controlling groups in dual-class companies. Although there is no standard nomenclature for multiple\u00a0share classes, Class A shares are normally superior to Class B shares. In other cases, though, the reverse is true. That's why investors should research the details of a company's share classes if they are considering investing in a firm with more than one class of shares. Well-known companies, such as Ford and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, have dual class stock structures, which provide founders, executives, and families the ability to control majority voting power with a relatively small percentage of total equity. The dual-class structure at Ford, for instance, gives the Ford family control of 40% of the voting power, while owning a small percentage of the company's total equity. An extreme example is Echostar Communications CEO Charlie Ergen, who controls around 91.8% of the vote with his powerful Class A shares. Dual-class structures allow companies to access public capital without sacrificing control. While they've recently become popular, dual-class structures have been around for some time in various forms. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) banned dual-class structures in 1940 after an outcry in 1926 over automotive company Dodge Brothers' public offering, which consisted of non-voting shares for the public. However, the exchange reinstated the practice during the 1980s in the wake of competition from other exchanges. Once shares are listed, companies cannot reverse any voting rights attributed to the new class,\u00a0or issue any classes of shares with superior voting rights. The approximate percentage of U.S. companies in the\u00a0Russell 3000 Index\u00a0with a dual- or multiple-class structure, according to a Harvard Law School study. In recent times, the number of companies opting for a dual-class structure during listing has multiplied. This is particularly the case among technology startups, many of which use this strategy to retain control over their outfits. Alphabet Inc.'s Google is the most famous example of this trend (see below). Alphabet Inc.'s Google is the most famous example of this trend. Many investors were frustrated at Google\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) when the internet giant, boasting a market capitalization among the top 30 firms worldwide, issued second Class B shares to founders with 10 times the amount of votes as the ordinary Class A shares sold to the public. Several stock indexes have stopped including companies with dual-class structures. The S&P 500 and FTSE Russell are two such indexes. Dual class stock structures are controversial. Their supporters argue that the structure enables founders to demonstrate strong leadership and the\u00a0placing of long-term interests over near-term financial results. It also helps founders retain control over the company as potential takeovers can be avoided through their supermajority voting shares. On the other hand, opponents argue that the structure allows a small group of privileged shareholders to maintain control, while other shareholders (with less voting power) provide the majority of the capital. In effect, there is an unequal distribution of risk. The founder is able to access capital from public markets at minimal economic risk. Shareholders carry a major part of the risk related to strategy. Academic research has proved that powerful classes of shares for insiders can actually hinder long-term outperformance. A middle path has been suggested by another group of shareholders. According to them, the effects of a dual-class structure can be limited by placing a time-bound restriction on such structures and allowing shareholders to accumulate voting interest over time. Alphabet subsidiary Google is the most famous example of a company with a dual-class structure. When it was listed in 2004, the search giant unveiled two classes of shares in its offering. Class A shares were reserved for regular investors and had one vote per share. Class B shares were reserved for founders and executives and had 10 times as many votes as those for the \"ordinary\" A shares. Many investors were frustrated at this initial public offering (IPO), given that the internet giant boasted a market capitalization among the top 30 firms worldwide. Later, the company added a third class of shares. These Class C shares came with zero voting rights. Other examples of companies with dual-class structures are Meta (formerly Facebook), Zynga, Groupon, and Alibaba. Ford. \"2021 Proxy Statement,\" Page 98. Accessed Nov. 24, 2021.

            "title": "Mid-Cap: Definition, Other Sizes, Valuation Limits, and Example",
            "content": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Mid-cap (or mid-capitalization) is the term that is used to designate companies with a market cap (capitalization)\u2014or market value\u2014between $2 and $10 billion. As the name implies, a mid-cap company falls in the middle between large-cap\u00a0(or big-cap) and small-cap companies. Classifications, such as large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap are approximations of a company's current value; as such, they may change over time. There are two main ways a company can raise capital when it's needed: through debt or equity. Debt must be paid back but can generally be borrowed at a lower rate than equity (due to tax advantages). Equity may cost more, but it does not need to be paid back in times of crisis. As a result, companies strive to strike a balance between debt and equity. This balance is referred to as a firm's capital structure. Capital structure, especially equity capital structure, can tell investors a lot about the growth prospects for a company. One way to gain insight\u00a0about a company's capital structure and market depth is by calculating its market capitalization. Companies with low market capitalization, also referred to as small-caps, have $2 billion or less in market capitalization. Large-capitalization firms have over $10 billion in market capitalization, and mid-cap firms fall somewhere in between these two categories (ranging from $2 billion to $10 billion in market capitalization). Additional categories such as mega-cap (over $200 billion), micro-cap ($50 million to $500 million) and nano-cap (less than $50 million) have been added to the spectrum of market capitalization for the sake of clarity. For investors, a mid-cap company may be appealing because they are expected to grow and increase in profits, market share, and productivity; they are in the middle of their growth curve. Since they are still considered to be in a growth stage, they are deemed to be less risky than small-caps, but more risky than large-caps. Successful mid-cap companies run the risk of seeing their market capitalization rise, mainly due to an increase in their share prices, to the point where they fall out of the 'mid-cap' category. While a company's market cap depends on market price, a company with a stock priced above $10 is not necessarily a mid-cap stock. To calculate market capitalization, analysts multiply the current market price by the current number of shares outstanding. For example, if company A has 10 billion shares outstanding at a price of $1, it has a market capitalization of $10 billion. If company B has one billion shares outstanding at a price of $5, company B has a market capitalization of $5 billion. Even though company A has a lower stock price, it has a higher market capitalization than company B. Company B may have the higher stock price, but it has one-tenth of the shares outstanding. Most financial advisors suggest that the key to minimizing risk is a well-diversified portfolio; investors should have a mix of small-, mid- and large-cap stocks. However, some investors see mid-cap stocks as a way to diversify risk, as well. Small-cap stocks offer the most growth potential, but that growth comes with the most risk. Large-cap stocks offer the most stability, but they offer lower growth prospects. Mid-cap stocks represent a hybrid of the two, providing a balance of growth and stability. No one can accurately predict when the market will favor a specific kind of company, whether it\u2019s a large-, mid- or small-cap. So it\u2019s important to diversify your portfolio, as we mentioned above. But the percentage of mid-caps that you\u2019ll want to invest in depends on your specific goals and risk tolerance. However, there are many advantages to mid-cap companies that investors may want to consider. When interest rates are low and capital is cheap, corporate growth is generally stable. Mid-cap companies typically can get the credit they need in order to grow, and they do well during the expansion part of the business cycle. Mid-caps are not as risky as small-cap companies, which means they tend to do relatively well financially during times of economic turbulence. In addition, many mid-caps are well known, are often focused on one specific business, and have been around long enough to make a niche in their target market. And finally, because they are riskier than large caps, they may have a higher return, which could be more appealing to a less risk averse investor's bottom line. Investor's can either buy a mid-cap company's stock directly or buy a mid-cap mutual fund\u2014an investment vehicle that focuses on mid-cap companies."

            "title": "What Are Preference Shares and What Are the Types of Preferred Stock?",
            "content": "Preference shares, more commonly referred to as preferred stock, are shares of a company\u2019s stock with dividends that are paid out to shareholders before common stock dividends are issued. If the company enters bankruptcy, preferred stockholders are entitled to be paid from company assets before common stockholders. Most preference shares have a fixed dividend, while common stocks generally do not. Preferred stock shareholders also typically do not hold any voting rights, but common shareholders usually do. Investopedia / Jessica Olah Preference shares fall under four categories: cumulative preferred stock, non-cumulative preferred stock, participating preferred stock and convertible preferred stock. Cumulative preferred stock includes a provision that requires the company to pay shareholders all dividends, including those that were omitted in the past, before the common shareholders are able to receive their dividend payments. These dividend payments are guaranteed but not always paid out when they are due. Unpaid dividends are assigned the moniker \"dividends in arrears\" and must legally go to the current owner of the stock at the time of payment. At times additional compensation (interest) is awarded to the holder of this type of preferred stock. Non-cumulative preferred stock does not issue any omitted or unpaid dividends. If the company chooses not to pay dividends in any given year, the shareholders of the non-cumulative preferred stock have no right or power to claim such forgone dividends at any time in the future. Participating preferred stock provides its shareholders with the right to be paid dividends in an amount equal to the generally specified rate of preferred dividends, plus an additional dividend based on a predetermined condition. This additional dividend is typically designed to be paid out only if the amount of dividends received by common shareholders is greater than a predetermined per-share amount. If the company is liquidated, participating preferred shareholders may also have the right to be paid back the purchasing price of the stock as well as a pro-rata share of remaining proceeds received by common shareholders. Convertible preferred stock includes an option that allows shareholders to convert their preferred shares into a set number of common shares, generally any time after a pre-established date. Under normal circumstances, convertible preferred shares are exchanged in this way at the shareholder's request. However, a company may have a provision on such shares that allows the shareholders or the issuer to force the issue. How valuable convertible common stocks are is based, ultimately, on how well the common stock performs. Preference shares, also known as preferred shares, are a type of security that offers characteristics similar to both common shares and a fixed-income security. The holders of preference shares are typically given priority when it comes to any dividends that the company pays. In exchange, preference shares often do not enjoy the same level of voting rights or upside participation as common shares. There are four main types of preference shares: cumulative preferred, non-cumulative preferred, participating preferred, and convertible. Holders of cumulative preferred shares are entitled to receive dividends retroactively for any dividends that were not paid in prior periods, whereas non-cumulative preferred shares do not carry this provision. For this reason, cumulative preferred shares will generally be more expensive than non-cumulative preferreds. Similarly, participating preferred shares offer the benefit of additional dividends if certain performance targets are reached, such as company profits exceeding a specified level. Convertible preferreds, like convertible bonds, allow the holder to convert their preference shares into common shares at a specified exercise price. If a company goes bankrupt, then the different securityholders in that company will have claim to the company\u2019s assets. The order in which those securityholders receive their share of the assets will depend on the specific rights given to them in their security agreements. Preference shares, for instance, will generally have priority over the common shares, and will therefore be paid before the common shareholders. However, preference shares will generally have lower priority than corporate bonds, debentures, or other fixed-income securities.

            "title": "Share Turnover: Definition, What It Signals, Formula, and Example",
            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. Kateryna Onyshchuk / Getty Images Share turnover is a measure of stock liquidity, calculated by dividing the total number of shares traded during some period by the average number of shares outstanding for the same period. The higher the share turnover, the more liquid company shares are. Share turnover should not be confused with the turnover rate of a mutual fund or an exchange traded fund (ETF), which measures how actively managed the portfolio is. Share turnover ratio indicates how easy, or difficult, it is to sell shares of a particular stock on the market. It compares the number of shares that change hands during a particular period with the total number of shares that could have been traded during that same period.\u00a0Investors may be unwilling to put their money at risk by acquiring the shares of a company with low share turnover. That said, share turnover is interesting as a measure because the correlations don't always hold up. Investors often assume that smaller companies will see less share turnover because they are, in theory, less liquid than large companies. However, these companies often see a greater portion of share turnover compared to large companies. Part of this is pricing. Some large companies have share prices in the hundreds of dollars. Although their huge floats mean hundreds of thousands of shares can trade a day, the actual percentage of the total outstanding is small. In contrast, smaller companies usually have correspondingly cheaper shares; the opportunity cost of loading up and unloading based on the growth prospects is smaller in terms of capital commitment. One reason companies split their stock is to try to keep their shares affordable and, therefore, more liquid. Sometimes large, high-quality companies have less share turnover than smaller, lower-quality companies because the share price of the larger company is so high it inhibits frequent trading. To compute a company's share turnover ratio, you need two numbers. The formula for share turnover is: Share Turnover = Trading Volume / Average Shares Outstanding The first number is the trading volume. The trading volume is the average number of shares traded in a given period. Many exchanges or financial information websites will provide this information for any given security. The second number is the average shares outstanding. This is the total number of shares of a stock a company has issued. It is important to note that this is not the total number of authorized shares a company has; the number of shares outstanding is often less (but may be equal to) what they are authorized to issue. Unfortunately, there is no rule of thumb for what a healthy share turnover ratio is as it depends on the company and the sector it is in. Moreover, stocks with large amounts of seasonality will see their share turnover ratios surge along with the demand for the stock at these times. Often, companies with higher stock prices will have lower turnover as a single share of stock is more expensive to buy, limiting its liquidity. This may unfortunately make a stock seem less desirable; as a company performs better and its stock price rises, its liquidity may fall. Another aspect of share turnover is defining an investor's desired goal for liquidity. During economic downturns where it is easier to trade on emotions, investors may want stock that is harder to buy or sell. These types of illiquid assets may help preserve its value during volatility as they can't be bought or sold as quickly. Therefore, while most investors generally want liquid assets, stocks with lower share turnover may still fit into the investment goals of some investors. The share turnover ratio only tells you how easily an investor can get trade of shares. It doesn't necessarily tell you anything about the performance of a company behind the stock. For example, at the end of 2021, Apple had approximately 16.4 billion shares issued and outstanding. On Dec. 31, 2021, Apple's 30-day average daily volume was 110.78 million shares. Therefore, at the end of 2021, Apple's share turnover ratio for the month of December was: Apple's Share Turnover = 110.78 million / 16.4 billion = 0.68% Alternatively, at the end of 2021, Microsoft had 7.547 billion shares outstanding, and its 30-day average daily volume on the last day of 2021 was 28.31 million Microsoft's Share Turnover = 28.31 million / 7.547 billion = 0.38% At a glance, it may seem that Apple's stock performed nearly twice as well. However, these percentages are simply measures of liquidity. Investors traded more shares of stock of Apple relative to the number of outstanding shares available to trade than compared to Microsoft. While it is still a useful measurement, share turnover does have its limitations. Share turnover doesn't rely any actual financial performance; a stock can simply begin and end a trading period with a very high turnover ratio but end at the exact same price as before. The share turnover ratio also fails to indicate the direction a stock may be heading. For example, imagine the news that government regulation will no longer allow U.S. citizens from buying gas-powered vehicles. Shares of companies impacted would likely fall as investors would seek to sell their shares. As the stock gets bought up at a materially reduced price, the stock's share turnover will likely be high. Though a higher share turnover is often better, that may not always be the case. Share turnover is calculated by dividing the average number of shares traded over a given period by the average number of total outstanding shares for that same period. The percentage result represents what percent of all available shares that could have been traded were actually traded. Share turnover communicates to investors the liquidity of the stock they hold. Some investors were more comfortable knowing they could easily buy or sell a specific company's stock. Alternatively, some investors may want lower liquidity, as this makes it harder for traders to emotionally sell their shares. Though share turnover doesn't indicate anything about the price movement of a stock, it simply informs investors on how easily their shares may be sold in the future. Generally, a high share turnover ratio is better if investors want to more easily buy or sell securities. A high share turnover calculation means the stock is more liquid. If an investor is intentionally seeking stock that is more difficult to sell (which may stabilize its value during emotional periods of trading), it would then be better to seek out companies with low share turnover calculations. A company can not directly improve its share turnover ratio, as share turnover is simply a reflection of how the market interacts with a company's stock. If a company wants higher liquidity, it can do several things. First, a company can perform a stock split. Although this will increase the number of shares outstanding, a stock split will divide the company's stock price and make it more accessible for new investors to buy full shares. Second, a company can perform well. Should a company improve its bottom line and begin performing tremendously well, more investors will demand the stock, driving up the number of shares people trade and increasing the share turnover.

            "content": "Pete Rathburn is a copy editor and fact-checker with expertise in economics and personal finance and over twenty years of experience in the classroom. A theoretical ex-rights price (TERP) is the market price that a stock will theoretically have following a new rights issue. Companies may use a new rights issuance to offer more shares to shareholders, usually at a discounted price. Stock prices are affected by new rights issuance because it increases the number of shares outstanding. A theoretical ex-rights price is a consideration for stock issued through a\u00a0rights offering. Typically, rights offerings are only available for current shareholders and only offered for a\u00a0short time (approximately 30 days). Rights offerings usually give shareholders the option to buy a proportioned number of shares at a discounted, pre-specified price. The portion each shareholder is allowed to purchase is based on the shareholder's current stake in the organization. The goal is to raise additional capital with preference given to current shareholders. Stock rights offerings can be a popular event for investors and traders as they may create potential arbitrage opportunities through the rights offering period. Overall the rights offering period can somewhat mitigate efficient market trading as it creates uncertainty over the stock\u2019s price. Generally, stock rights offerings are tools managers can use in raising capital through the stock. Management may choose to use stock rights offerings to generate additional interest in a company\u2019s stock. Since rights offerings are commonly offered at a discounted price, stock rights usually have a diluting effect on a stock\u2019s price. As such, the TERP is usually lower than the pre-offering market price. The theoretical ex-rights price is usually calculated immediately following the last day of a stock\u2019s rights offering. This calculation makes the stock\u2019s price somewhat arbitrary and potentially more enticing for arbitrage trades throughout the rights offering period. The simplest way to create a TERP estimate is to add the current market value of all shares existing before\u00a0the rights issue to the total funds raised from the rights issue sales. This number is then divided by the total number of shares in existence after the rights issue is complete. This calculation results in the value of an individual share after the offering. Throughout the offering period, all types of investors can speculate on the number of shares expected to be taken by shareholders, but usually, only current shareholders can participate. The basis for speculation in this scenario involves the number of share rights available, the expected demand, and the rights offering price. Companies may have various types of disclosure for this information which can make the estimate even more difficult. The theoretical ex-rights price (TERP) is often lower than the stock's price before the offering because rights offerings are usually discounted, diluting the stock price. Investors can compare the TERP to the current value of a share and their expectations for future market appreciation. Since rights are offered at a discounted price, the more rights exercised, the more the stock\u2019s price becomes diluted. However, throughout the rights offering period, supply and demand still affect the market price so while dilution is occurring, investor demand can still increase the prevailing market price. Investors who are bullish on the stock long term may be more motivated by the offering while bearish or short-term investors may not see as much upside. Management of ABC Company has chosen to issue a rights offering. The provisions of the offering allow each shareholder to buy shares in the offering based on the percentage of their outstanding shares. The new shares are offered to investors at a discounted price to the market price. Shareholders can use the TERP to determine the estimated value of the shares after the rights issue. This amount will differ from the current market price. It is possible for multiple theoretical\u00a0estimated values to be calculated\u00a0for the stock\u00a0before the end of the offering period based on some different scenarios. An investor might look at the TERP value if 25% of the shares are purchased in the rights offering versus 50%, 75%, or 100%. Overall the more shares bought, the greater the potential for dilution when the shares are sold at a discounted offering price."

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. The terms cyclical and non-cyclical refer to how closely correlated a company's share price is to the fluctuations of the economy. Cyclical stocks and their companies have a direct relationship to the economy, while non-cyclical stocks repeatedly outperform the market when economic growth slows. Investors cannot control the cycles of the economy, but they can tailor their investing practices to its ebb and flow. Adjusting to economic transitions requires an understanding of how industries relate to the economy. There are fundamental differences between companies that are affected by broad economic changes and those that are virtually immune to them. Cyclical companies follow the trends in the overall economy, which makes their stock prices very volatile. When the economy grows, prices for cyclical stocks go up. When the economy turns down, their stock prices will drop. They follow all the cycles of the economy from expansion, peak, and recession all the way to recovery. Cyclical stocks represent companies that make or sell discretionary items and services that are in demand when the economy is doing well. They include restaurants, hotel chains, airlines, furniture, high-end clothing retailers, and automobile manufacturers. These are also the goods and services that people cut first when times are tough. When people delay or stop buying anything dispensable, the revenues of the companies that produce and sell them fall. This, in turn, puts pressure on their stock prices, which start to drop. In the event of a long downturn, some of these companies may even go out of business. Investors may find opportunities in cyclical stocks hard to predict because of the correlation they have to the economy. Since it's hard to predict the ups and downs of the economic cycle, it's tricky to guess how well a cyclical stock will do. Cyclical industries make or sell products that we can live without or delay buying when times are tough. Examples include luxury goods, non-business travel, and new construction.  Non-cyclical stocks repeatedly outperform the market when economic growth slows. They may also be known as consumer staples since they are always in demand as basic needs. Non-cyclical securities are generally profitable regardless of economic trends because they produce or distribute goods and services we always need, including things like food, power, water, and gas. The stocks of companies that produce these goods and services are also called defensive stocks because they can defend investors against the effects of an economic downturn. They are great places in which to invest when the economic outlook is sour. For example, non-durable household goods like toothpaste, soap, shampoo, and dish detergent may not seem like essentials, but they really can't be sacrificed. Most people don't feel they can wait until next year to lather up with soap in the shower. A utility company is another example of a non-cyclical. People need power and heat for themselves and their families. By providing a service that is consistently used, utility companies grow conservatively and do not fluctuate dramatically. This is a key fact about non-cyclical stocks. They provide safety, but they are not going to skyrocket in price when the economy grows. Investing in non-cyclical stocks is a good way to avoid losses when highly-cyclical companies are suffering. Below is a historical example that uses a chart showing the performance of a highly-cyclical company, the Ford Motor Co. (blue line), and a classic non-cyclical company, Florida Public Utilities Co. (yellow line). This chart clearly demonstrates how each company's share price reacts to downturns in the economy. Image by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia 2020 Notice that the downturn in the economy from 2000 to 2002 drastically reduced Ford's share price, whereas the growth of Florida Public Utilities' share price barely blinked at the slowdown. This is because cars are considered discretionary goods that are cyclical to the economy. When there is a recession, people choose not to spend on a new car in order to save money for basic needs. Moreover, more people may be unemployed at the time. If a car is needed, perhaps those people will search for a used car instead. On the other hand, regardless of one's employment or the state of the economy. people still need to have water and electricity on in their homes. That means people will still pay their utility bills (for the most part), even when they begin to struggle financially, making it non-cyclical. Cyclical stocks tend to be for expensive durable goods, luxury, or leisure. Therefore, stocks in the automotive industry, consumer durables, airlines, luxury goods makers, and hospitality stocks would be prime examples. Sometimes analysts break down cyclical stocks into consumer and non-consumer. A non-consumer cyclical would be a company that sells to businesses, governments, or large organizations and which is also sensitive to the state of the economy. A consumer cyclical would be a cyclical stock that markets to individuals or households. Non-cyclical stocks are companies from which people will continue to consume their products even during an economic downturn. These often include consumer staple goods, food, gasoline, utilities, and pharmaceuticals/healthcare. Cyclical companies follow the trends in the overall economy, and therefore their stock prices are volatile. Non-cyclical companies produce consumer staples that are always in demand regardless of the state of the economy. Therefore, non-cyclical stocks can be profitable regardless of economic trends, and they can outperform the market when economic growth slows. Investing in non-cyclical stocks is considered to be safer than investing in cyclical stocks. During economic turndowns, non-cyclical companies won't produce the losses that highly-cyclical companies do. But for the same reason, when the economy grows, non-cyclical stocks won't surge in price either."

            "title": "Restricted Shares vs. Stock Options: What's the Difference?",
            "content": "Witthaya Prasongsin / Getty Images Restricted shares and stock options are both forms of equity compensation, but each comes with some conditions. Restricted shares can either be restricted stock units or restricted stock awards. Both involve vesting requirements. Stock options give an employee the right to buy a certain number of shares at an exercise price in the future. Like restricted shares, stock options often have vesting requirements. The employee may get a windfall if and when the company's stock price exceeds the exercise price and they exercise the options. Restricted shares are unregistered, non-transferable shares issued to a company's employees. They incentivize employees to help companies attain success. They are common in established companies that want to motivate people with an equity stake. Their sale is usually restricted by a vesting schedule. Because the value of restricted stock relies on the company's stock price, it can encourage employees to perform better. An employee receives restricted shares on the condition that they will continue to work at the company for a certain number of years or until a company milestone is met. This might be an earnings goal or another financial target. What's more, an executive who leaves the company fails, to meet performance goals, or runs afoul of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) trading restrictions\u00a0may have to forfeit their restricted stock. Restricted shares are often granted in stages, each having a vesting date or milestone attached. This gives employees rights to company assets over time. Once vested, restricted shares are assigned a fair market value (FMV). Restricted shares may also be restricted by a double-trigger provision. That means that an employee's shares become unrestricted if the company is acquired by another and the employee is fired in the restructuring that follows. Insiders are often awarded restricted shares\u00a0after a merger or other major corporate event. The restrictions are intended to deter premature selling that might adversely affect the company. There are two variations of restricted shares; restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock awards. RSUs represent an employer's promise to grant an employee a specific number of shares at a specific future date. They don't come with voting rights. They must be exercised to be converted to actual shares. In certain circumstances, they may be redeemable for cash. Once converted to actual shares, they confer shareholder rights (including voting rights) upon the employee. Employees who receive restricted stock awards own the stock outright when it's awarded. Owners have all shareholder rights. The owner may receive dividends and vote at the annual meeting. However, the company may reserve the right to buy back unvested shares if the employee leaves the company. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates the trading of restricted stock under SEC Rule 144. Stock options represent a right to buy (or sell) shares at a specific price (the exercise price) at some future date. They do not involve a transfer of ownership. An employee may profit by the difference between the exercise price and the actual market price. They're often granted by startup companies to motivate employees to help get the company off the ground. Stock options are normally restricted by a market standoff provision, which restricts the sale of shares for a certain time after an initial public offering (IPO) to stabilize the market price of the stock. Stock options provided as compensation by a public company often have a vesting schedule. This prevents people from leaving a company after only a short time with shares of company stock that could become valuable. A stock option involves a specific transaction date, an exercise (or strike) price, and the number of underlying shares involved. One stock option contract represents 100 shares of stock. The value of a stock option depends on the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying stock. It's important to familiarize yourself with the differences between restricted shares and stock options because the features of each can require different planning for the benefit you may receive. It means that they cannot be sold until the conditions of restriction are met. For instance, restricted shares given as a form of compensation usually are accompanied by a vesting schedule that establishes a period (or periods) of time that must pass before shares can be sold. Additionally, specific financial milestones may need to be met before employees may sell their shares. Generally speaking, if you have an option to buy, you'd exercise stock options within the time specified by the option contract and once the current market price rises above the strike price. That way, you can profit by selling the shares at a higher price than what you bought them for. It depends on how you view both forms of compensation. Restricted shares can be considered less of an effort to deal with because, typically, once vested, they're automatically deposited in a brokerage account on your behalf by your employer. Plus, restricted shares represent actual shares given to you. You don't have to buy them. Stock options involve more effort because you must exercise them and buy the underlying shares. There can be different tax implications, as well. Some public companies provide their employees with stock as a form of compensation. This is usually in addition to your salary to help motivate you to be part of the company's success. This type of compensation can come as restricted shares or stock options. Understanding how they work and the implications involved can save you a lot of money in the long run.

Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Stock price is an indicator of a company's market value, but the price of a share of stock will also depend on the number of shares outstanding. The reason why certain stocks are priced so high is usually due to\u00a0the company having never or rarely having completed\u00a0a stock split. There are many ways to evaluate a stock in addition to its absolute share price. Here, we take a look at some of the largest companies in the U.S. and abroad. The most expensive publicly traded share of all time is Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A), which was trading at $458,675 per share, as of January 2022. Berkshire hit an all-time high on Jan. 18, 2022, at $487,255. Thanks to spectacular shareholder gains and the idiosyncrasies of its founder, this share value is unlikely to be matched by anything other than continued gains in Berkshire\u2019s share price. The next company behind Berkshire, in terms of nominal share price, is NVR (NVR) at $5,154.98 per share as of January 2022. Then there is the Seaboard Corporation (SEB), which was trading at $3,731.02, and Amazon.com (AMZN) at $2,852.86, followed by Alphabet, Inc (GOOG) at $2,607.03 a share. By market capitalization, as of January 2022, Apple (AAPL) is the biggest company at $2.652 trillion, followed by Microsoft (MSFT) at $2.222 trillion, Google (GOOGL) at $1.725 trillion, Amazon.com (AMZN) at $1.446 trillion, Tesla (TSLA) at $947.92 billion, and Meta (META), formerly Facebook, at $843.34 billion. Back in 2007, Chinese energy giant\u00a0PetroChina\u00a0(PTR) reached an estimated\u00a0market value\u00a0of around $1 trillion. However, this valuation didn't stick. As of January 2022, PTR's market capitalization stood at just $146.95 billion. In terms of the biggest global companies by revenue, Walmart (WMT) comes in as number one\u2014according to the Fortune 500 list. Walmart's revenues were $523,964 billion in 2021. Behind Walmart was State Grid with $383,906 billion in revenues, followed by Amazon with $280,522 billion, and China National Petroleum at $379,130 billion. Sinopec Group ranks fifth with $407,009 billion in annual revenues, and the sixth and seventh spots are covered by Apple and CVS Health with $260,174 billion and $256,776 billion in yearly revenues, respectively. Based on only U.S.-headquartered companies' 2020 performance, Walmart still has the top spot, while Amazon comes in second. Exxon Mobil ranks third and Apple ranks fourth. Healthcare companies take up the fifth, seventh, and eighth spots: CVS, UnitedHealth Group, and McKesson, generating $256.78 billion, $242.15 billion, and $231.05 billion, respectively. Berkshire Hathaway ranks sixth with $254.62 billion in annual revenues, and the ninth and tenth spots\u00a0are covered by AT&T and AmerisourceBergen at $181.19 billion and $179.59 billion in yearly revenues, respectively. Based on only U.S.-headquartered\u00a0companies' 2019 performance, Walmart still has the top spot, while ExxonMobil (XOM) comes in second with $290.21 billion a year in revenues. Apple ranks third with $265.59 billion and Berkshire Hathaway fourth with $247.84 billion. Healthcare companies take up the sixth through eighth spots: UnitedHealth Group, McKesson, and CVS, generating $226.25 billion, $214.32 billion, and $194.58 billion, respectively. In terms of private companies, Forbes\u00a0ranks Minnesota-based Cargill as the largest private U.S. company with $134.4 billion in annual revenues. The company has 155,000 employees. Second is Koch Industries with $115 billion in revenues and 122,000 employees. Ranking third is the grocery chain\u00a0Publix Super Markets, with $44.9 billion in annual revenue and 227,000 employees. The fourth and fifth largest private companies are Mars and H-E-B, which generate $40 billion and $32.8 billion, respectively. Each employs over 100,000 employees. On a pure market value measure, Apple has often been considered the most valuable, publicly traded company of all time. Although Microsoft did briefly hit the $2 trillion market cap mark in June\u00a02021. It is certainly possible another company\u2019s market cap will exceed these measures, and maybe\u2014though less likely\u2014another company will surpass\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway as the highest priced single stock share.

            "title": "Back Stop: Definition, How It Works in Offering, and Example",
            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. Investopedia / Zoe Hansen In corporate finance and investment banking, a back stop (or backstop) is to provide last-resort support or to make a bid in a securities offering for the unsubscribed portion of shares. When a company is trying to raise capital through an issuance\u2014and wants to guarantee the amount received through the issue\u2014it may get a back stop from an underwriter or a major shareholder, such as an investment bank, to buy any of its unsubscribed shares. A back stop functions as a form of insurance. While not an actual insurance plan, a company can guarantee that a certain amount of its offering will be purchased by particular organizations, usually investment banking firms, if the open market does not produce enough investors and a portion of the offering goes unsold. If the organization providing the back stop is an investment banking firm, sub-underwriters representing the investment firm will enter into an agreement with the company. This agreement is referred to as a firm-commitment underwriting deal or contract, and it provides overall support for the offering by committing to purchase a specific number of unsold shares. By entering into a firm-commitment underwriting agreement, the associated organization has claimed full responsibility for the quantity of shares specified if they initially go unsold, and promises to provide the associated capital in exchange for the available shares. This gives assurance to the issuer that the minimum capital can be raised regardless of the open market activity. Additionally, all risk associated with the specified shares is effectively transferred to the underwritten organization. If all of the offering is purchased through regular investment vehicles, the contract obligating the organization to purchase any unsold shares is rendered void, as the conditions surrounding the promise to purchase no longer exist. The contracts between an issuer and the underwriting organization can take various forms. For example, the underwriting organization can provide the issuer with a revolving credit loan to boost credit ratings for the issuer. They may also issue letters of credit as guarantees to the entity raising capital through offerings. If the underwriting organization takes possession of any shares, as specified in the agreement, the shares belong to the organization to manage as it sees fit. The shares are treated the same way as any other investment purchased through normal market activity. The issuing company can impose no restrictions on how the shares are traded. The underwriting organization may subsequently hold or sell the associated securities per the regulations that govern the activity overall. In a rights offering, you may see a statement to this effect: \"ABC Company will provide a 100 percent back stop of up to $100 million for any unsubscribed portion of the XYZ Company rights offering.\" If XYZ is trying to raise $200 million, but only raises $100 million through investors, then ABC Company purchases the remainder. Similar to the back stop in an equity placement, a back stop for a bond issue is a type of guarantee whereby the underwriting bank or syndicate will fix a price at which to purchase any unsold or unsubscribed bonds. If the underwriting bank or investment banking syndicate cannot or do not want to back stop a new issue, third-party backstop purchasers may be called upon to step in and buy any unsubscribed portion of a securities issue. These purchasers may provide a bid substantially below the issue price and/or may demand fees as compensation. They would then often try to sell off the holdings over time at a profit. The Volcker Rule is a set of financial regulations that separates the commercial and investment banking activities of a firm. Its purpose is to prevent conflicts of interest and unfair practices to the detriment of a bank's customers. One provision of the Rule is to prevent the backstopping of a securities issue by an underwriting bank if it will create a conflict of interest. Moreover, a back stop would be prohibited if it would \"result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to a high-risk asset or a high-risk trading strategy; or pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States.\" Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute. \"17 CFR \u00a7 255.7 - Limitations on Permitted Proprietary Trading Activities.\""

            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. A bearer share is equity security wholly owned by the person or entity that holds the physical stock certificate, thus the name \"bearer\" share.\u00a0The issuing firm neither registers the owner of the stock nor tracks transfers of ownership; the company disperses dividends to bearer shares when a physical coupon is presented to the firm. Because the share is not registered to any authority, transferring the ownership of the stock involves only delivering the physical document. Bearer shares lack the regulation and control of common shares because ownership is never recorded. Bearer shares are similar to bearer bonds, which are fixed-income securities belonging to the holders of physical certificates rather than registered owners. Bearer shares are often international securities, common in Europe and South America \u2014 although the use of bearer shares in these nations has dwindled\u00a0as governments crackdown on anonymity-related illegal activity. While some jurisdictions, such as Panama, allow the use of bearer shares, they impose punitive tax withholdings on dividends issued to owners to discourage their use. The Marshall Islands is the only country in the world where the shares can be used without problems or extra costs. Many large foreign corporations over the past decade or so have also chosen to transition to full usage of registered shares. Germany-based pharmaceutical giant Bayer AG, for example, started to convert all its bearer shares to registered shares in 2009,\ufeff\ufeff and in 2015, the United Kingdom abolished the issuance of bearer shares under the provisions of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015.\ufeff\ufeff Switzerland, a jurisdiction known for its emphasis on secrecy in banking transactions, has abolished bearer shares. In June 2019, the Federal Council of the Swiss government adopted a new Federal Act declaring the end of bearer shares, with the exception of publicly-listed companies and intermediated securities. All other existing bearer shares must be converted into registered shares.\ufeff\ufeff In the United States, bearer shares are mostly an issue of state governance, and they are not traditionally endorsed in many jurisdictions' corporate laws. Delaware became the first state in the U.S. to ban the sale of bearer shares in 2002.\ufeff\ufeff Bearer shares appeal to some investors because of privacy,\u00a0but the tradeoff is the increased costs associated with maintaining that privacy, including attorney fees and taxes. The only tangible benefit to be gained from using bearer shares is privacy. The highest degree of anonymity possible is maintained with respect to ownership in a corporation by a holder of bearer shares. Although the banks that handle the purchases know the contact information of the people purchasing the shares, in some jurisdictions, banks are under no legal obligation to disclose the identity of the purchaser. Banks may also receive dividend payments on behalf of the shareholder and provide ownership confirmation at shareholders' general meetings. Moreover, purchases can be made by a representative, such as a law firm, of the actual owner. Bearer shares have some valid uses, despite their inherent detriments. Asset protection is the most common reason to use bearer shares because of the privacy they provide. For example, individuals who do not want to risk their assets being seized as part of a legal proceeding such as a divorce or a liability suit may resort to the use of bearer shares. The ownership of bearer shares often coincides with\u00a0an increased cost incurred from hiring professional representation and advisors to maintain the anonymity that bearer shares provide. Unless the bearer shareholder is a financial and/or legal expert in these matters, avoiding the many legal and tax traps associated with bearer shares can be a difficult challenge. Also, in a post-9/11 world in which the threat of terrorism looms heavily, part of the strategy to counter the threat is to cut off the sources of terrorist funding. Consequently, in a worldwide effort to deter terrorism funding, money laundering, and other illicit nefarious corporate activity, many jurisdictions have enacted new legislation that places very tight restrictions on the use of bearer shares or, has altogether abolished their use. For example, the Panama Papers scandal extensively used bearer shares to conceal the true ownership of shares. The Panama Papers scandal was a leak of financial files that exposed a network of more than 200,000 tax havens involving high net worth individuals, public officials, and entities from 200 nations.\ufeff\ufeff It resulted in the reluctance of many banks and financial institutions to open accounts or have any associations with corporations or shareholders that deal with bearer shares. The choice of jurisdictions and financial institutions willing to deal with bearer shares has narrowed significantly.

It was created by Investor's Business Daily founder William J. O'Neil. The acronym is sometimes written as CAN SLIM. CANSLIM, or CAN SLIM, identifies a process that investors can use to identify stocks that are poised to grow faster than average. Each letter in the acronym stands for a key factor to look for when purchasing shares. Stocks that are CANSLIM candidates show the following attributes: The L in the original CANSLIM model created by O\u2019Neil stands for both \"Leader\" or \"Laggard\". Some have argued that leading stocks should be considered instead of laggards, since they would be stocks that possess superior fundamentals and are part of a leading industry group or sector. CANSLIM is a bullish strategy for fast markets, so it is not for everyone. The idea is to get into high-growth stocks before the institutional funds are fully invested. The elements of CANSLIM can be read like a wish list for fund managers seeking growth, so it is a matter of time until the buying demand increases. The catch is that stocks that fit the CANSLIM strategy can be among the fastest to drop if the market direction shifts and those big-spending institutional investors begin switching to safe-havens. CANSLIM can be a good fit for an experienced investor with high risk tolerance. These stocks cannot be bought and simply held as much of the value is being priced in for future growth.

            "title": "Fractional Share: Definition, Examples, How to Buy and Sell",
            "content": "Less than one full share of equity is called a fractional share. Such shares\u00a0may be the result of stock splits, dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs), or\u00a0similar corporate actions. Typically, fractional shares aren't available from the stock market, and while they have value to investors, they are also difficult to sell. Fractional shares come about in a number of ways, including dividend reinvestment plans, stock splits, mergers, and acquisitions. Dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP) often create fractional shares. A dividend reinvestment plan is a plan in which a\u00a0dividend-offering corporation or brokerage firm allows investors to use dividend\u00a0payouts\u00a0to purchase more of the same shares. As this amount \"drips\" back into the purchase of more shares, it is not limited to whole shares. Reinvesting capital gain distributions and dollar-cost averaging programs can also result in purchasing fractional shares. Stock splits don't always result in an even number of shares. A 3-for-2 stock split would create three shares for every two shares an investor owns, so an investor with an odd number of shares would end up with a fractional share after the split. Three shares would become 4\u00bd, five would become 7\u00bd, and so on. Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) may also create fractional shares since companies combine new common stock using a predetermined ratio. The ratio often results in fractional shares for shareholders. Some brokerage firms will split whole shares intentionally so they can sell fractional shares to clients. This division of shares is most often the case with high-priced stocks like Amazon (AMZN) or Alphabet, Google's parent company (GOOGL). As of March 2020, AMZN was selling for more than $1,800 per share, and GOOGL was selling for more than $1,100 per share. Fractional shares often can be the only way individual investors can buy stock insuch companies. For example, a young investor with limited funds might have their heart set on buying stock in Amazon. Starting with $1,000 to invest, they won't have enough to buy a full share of stock, so they might find a brokerage firm willing to sell a fractional share. They could invest half of the money in one-third of a share of Amazon and use the other half to invest in lower-priced stocks that would allow them to buy full shares. In the event of stocks splits, mergers, and acquisitions, shareholders sometimes are given the option of obtaining cash in lieu of the fractional shares. The income received is taxable. The only way to sell fractional shares is through a major brokerage firm, which can join them\u00a0with other fractional shares until a whole share is attained. If the selling stock does not have a high demand in the marketplace, selling the fractional shares might take longer than hoped. Not everyone wants to hold onto fractional shares, especially if they ended up with them for inadvertent reasons such as stock splits. An investor might have 225 shares of XYZ stock priced at $12 per share. After a 3-for-2 stock split, they would end up with 337\u00bd shares priced at $8 per share. If there is a high demand for XYZ stock in the market, they'll be more likely to find a brokerage firm willing to take the fractional share.
