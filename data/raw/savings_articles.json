            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Amanda Bellucco-Chatham is an editor, writer, and fact-checker with years of experience researching personal finance topics. Specialties include general financial planning, career development, lending, retirement, tax preparation, and credit. The best high-yield savings account rate is 5.50% APY from Pibank. That's more than 12 times the FDIC's national average for savings accounts of 0.45% APY. A high-yield savings account is great because it pays more interest, while still giving you the flexibility to withdraw your money when needed. All savings accounts and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Nov. 15, 2024. Every business day, we publish a ranking based on the highest savings account APYs available that day from nationally available institutions. Below, you'll find our partners' savings and cash management accounts\u2014from banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions that use partner banks\u2014followed by our top 15 ranking of the best savings account rates available nationwide. The Fed cut rates by a quarter point at its Nov. 7 meeting, its second rate cut in two meetings. Coupled with September's half-point cut, the federal funds rate has been reduced by a cumulative 0.75 percentage points to a range of 4.50%\u20134.75%. Savings rates are influenced by the fed funds rate, which means savings rates are expected to come down as the Fed lowers rates. The top savings account rates in the country are listed below in order of APY. Where more than one financial institution has the same rate, we've ranked accounts by those requiring the smallest minimum ongoing balance, and if the same there as well, we list the tied institutions alphabetically. Note that some banks call their savings accounts \"money market\" accounts. Money market accounts traditionally offer the ability to write checks, while savings accounts do not. None of the accounts listed here offer check-writing privileges, even if the name might suggest otherwise. It's smart to also check our ranking of the best money market accounts, some of which pay comparable interest rates. Note: TotalBank is available to customers nationwide except for Florida residents. Note: Although this account has \"money market\" in its name, it offers no check-writing privileges and instead operates like a savings account. *Requires a mobile device with face or fingerprint recognition; account unavailable to residents of Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. *In order to earn its highest rate, Fitness Bank requires an average daily step count of 12,500, which is tracked through its app. However, additional APY tiers are offered for lower step counts. Note: Although this account has \"money market\" in its name, it offers no check-writing privileges and instead operates like a savings account. *New customers only Note: Although this account has \"money market\" in its name, it offers no check-writing privileges and instead operates like a savings account. Investopedia collects savings account rates from over 100 banks and credit unions every weekday. When ranking high-yield savings account rates, we look at factors that will help readers choose the best savings account, like minimum opening deposit. We also research banks and credit unions to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decisions for their needs. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best high-yield savings account rates since 2019. As the name implies, high-yield savings accounts pay much higher interest rates than traditional ones. Often offered online, whether by an internet-only bank or the online division of a brick-and-mortar bank, they're a type of savings account that's based on the idea of holding your savings wherever it can earn a competitively high yield, even if that's a different bank than where you hold your checking account. The difference in savings account interest rates can be dramatic, with the top accounts in the country typically offering 10 to 12 times the national average rate. And you can still keep your checking account where it is, because it's simple to link a high-yield savings account to your primary account for easy transfers. Stashing some of your cash in a savings account is smart whether you're saving for something specific, or just want to sock money away for when you'll need it in the future. Here are some common reasons to open a savings account: I first opened a high-yield savings account with American Express in 2019, and have urged friends and family to open high-yield savings accounts, too. While Amex doesn't offer the top rate nationwide, it has a great mobile app, which is how I do most of my banking. I can see my high-yield savings account right next to my credit cards, and can easily deposit money from my checking to my savings via the app. ~Hilarey Gould, Editorial Director at Investopedia The amount of money you can earn in a high-yield savings account will be based on how much you deposit, how much you contribute per month, and what your interest rate is. Let's say you start with $1,000 in a high-yield savings account. You have a 5.00% APY and contribute $100 per month. After three months, you'd earn about $13 in interest. After six months, you'd earn about $31 in interest. After 12 months, you'd earn about $77 in total interest and have an ending balance of $2,277. Now, let's say you do the same thing\u2014$1,000 starting balance and $100 monthly contributions\u2014but in a regular savings account. In September 2024, the national average rate for savings accounts was 0.45%, which is still higher than what many big banks pay on savings accounts. U.S. Bank, Chase, and Wells Fargo, for example, all pay just 0.1% interest on their traditional savings accounts. For this example, we'll use 0.1% since that is so often what banks pay on savings accounts. After three months, you'd earn about 27 cents in interest. After six months, you'd earn about 62 cents in interest. After 12 months, you'd earn about $1.55 in total interest and have an ending balance of $2,201.55. That's over $75 less than what you could earn in a high-yield savings account. Once you've decided to open up a new high-yield savings account, you'll want to do your homework to make sure you're choosing the best one for your needs. Searching for a top annual percentage yield (APY) is a good starting point when choosing a high-yield savings account, as you'll want to earn a competitive rate. Though the interest rate can change, it makes sense to choose an account that is paying one of the highest rates in the country, since the higher your rate, the more interest you'll collect every month and every year. Also, through the power of compounding, you can make interest off your interest, and the higher the APY on your account, the better. But beyond the interest rate, you'll also want to make sure the account either doesn't have a minimum balance requirement, or has one that you feel confident you can regularly maintain. Also, note if there is a minimum balance required to earn the top APY. Each bank is a business that has different needs for customer deposits, operating in its own regional market. As a result, some banks have to work harder to attract funds, such as smaller banks with names you may not be familiar with. Also important is the lending activity the bank is undertaking. If, for instance, a bank is in a strategic push to build its commercial lending portfolio, it will need to attract more customer deposits in order to fund those loans it hopes to make. One way they can do this is offering a promotional APY for a short period to boost their deposits balance, but then lowering it after they've accumulated enough funds. When researching high-yield savings accounts to find the best one for you, be sure you understand what these commonly used terms mean. After comparing the best high-yield savings account and landing on a choice, the next step is to open the account online. Here's how that generally works: Once the application process is completed, you may be able to set up online banking right away, or you may need to wait a day or two for your account to be fully opened. Transfers between different institutions will take one to three days to complete, so be sure to keep enough of a cash cushion either in your checking account or in a linked savings account at that same institution. That way you won\u2019t run into trouble if you can\u2019t get funds from your high-yield account for a couple of days. Higher APY than traditional savings accounts Ability to withdraw or deposit funds at any time Extremely safe, with virtually no risk Excellent vehicle for an emergency fund or saving for a big goal In times of rising rates, your APY may go up Earning a top yield may require opening an account with a new institution Some accounts have withdrawal limits of six per month Easy access can make it tempting to dip into savings Account could have a fee or minimum balance requirement In times of decreasing rates, your APY may go down Anyone with surplus savings in the bank can benefit from a high-yield savings account. If you have more money in the bank than you need to hold in your checking account, high-yield savings accounts offer a way to sock some of those funds away to earn an especially high annual percentage yield (APY). High-yield savings accounts are also well suited to those comfortable with internet or mobile banking, as moving money in and out of an online savings account must generally be done on your computer or via a mobile banking app on your phone. When choosing the best savings account for you, you'll want to check the rules of the account, such as whether it limits the number of withdrawals you can make in a month, and if you'll be assessed a monthly maintenance fee. Lastly, check that the bank is an FDIC member (or an NCUA member if it's a credit union) so that your money is insured by the federal government\u2014up to $250,000 per depositor\u2014should the bank or credit union fail. Online reviews of a bank's customer service may also prove useful. High-yield savings accounts are just one vehicle for stashing your cash, and they often pay the highest APYs. But there are several alternatives for holding your funds until you need them. While the easiest place to keep surplus funds is in your checking account, this has two major downsides. First, money kept in your everyday checking account is very easy to spend, making it difficult to leave earmarked as savings. Second, checking accounts tend not to pay any interest\u2014or if they do, the rate is a pittance. A high-yield savings account offers an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on your money. Some high-yield or rewards checking accounts do exist, with rates that are more competitive. But these accounts require jumping through some hoops\u2014sometimes every month\u2014in order to earn their high rate. Still, if you're a heavy debit card user, one of the best rewards checking accounts may be a good option for you. There is no formal definition of how high a rate needs to be to qualify as \"high yield\". In short, it's up to each institution how to name their savings accounts. Traditional banks and credit unions more often offer traditional savings accounts, while online banks are more likely to offer a high-yield savings account. But again, the distinctions are fuzzy, rather than hard-and-fast rules. We track the savings account rates of over 100 banks and credit unions every weekday. While we do check the rates at big banks\u2014including the five largest banks of Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi, and U.S. Bank\u2014their rates aren't usually high enough to make our ranking. Meanwhile, other institutions may not qualify for our ranking because they aren't available to customers in at least 40 states, or they significantly limit the balance on which you can earn their high-yield APY. A money market account operates very much like a savings account, with the exception that it allows writing checks. In the past, money market accounts typically imposed high minimum deposit requirements in exchange for higher rates than savings accounts. This has shifted in recent years, however, with savings and money market accounts both having a variety of required minimum balances\u2014including no-minimums accounts. In addition, high-yield savings accounts often pay more competitive rates than money markets, though sometimes you can find a higher APY among the top-paying money market accounts. \"When a client has money they won't need in the next 12 to 24 months, I encourage them to take advantage of a high-yield savings account or money market account to hedge against inflation as well remove the funds from their actively used checking accounts. Basically, a 'hands off account,'\" said Sibyl Slade, a member of Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council. If some of your savings can be socked away and not touched for a period of time, you may be able to earn a higher rate with a certificate of deposit. CDs require you to commit your funds to remain on deposit for a number of months or years, imposing a penalty if you request to withdraw the funds before the CD\u2019s maturity date. But in exchange, your interest rate is locked and guaranteed, even if the Fed lowers rates. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs can lead you to the highest available APYs no matter the CD term you choose. Some people wonder if you can lose money in a high-yield savings account. In a worst-case scenario, a savings account will pay no interest, meaning your funds don't grow at all. But you would never lose the money you put into the account, other than due to fees you've been assessed. So it's important to choose an account where you can easily avoid paying any fees. As for losing money due to a bank failure, the vast majority of banks\u2014whether physical or online\u2014are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which protects banking customers by insuring up to $250,000 of their deposits per institution if the bank fails. The U.S. government similarly backs credit union customers for up to $250,000 by providing insurance through the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). That means whether your institution is a traditional brick-and-mortar bank with branches or is an online bank or credit union, and whether it\u2019s big or small, your deposits up to $250,000 are equally safe and protected. The top-paying institutions for savings accounts vary, with no one bank perpetually leading the rate rankings. In general, the top rate contenders tend to be online operations, whether owned by a physical bank or set up as a fully online-only institution. You can always find today's highest rates\u2014currently well above 5%\u2014and the institutions that offer them by regularly checking our ranking in this article. Or for a list that is exclusive to banks (no credit unions), you can check our daily ranking of the best banks for savings accounts. While it would be nice to earn 7% on money held in savings, no banks or credit unions are paying that much on a regular savings account. The only account paying a 7% APY right now is a savings account for kids, but only on balances up to $1,000. Savings account rates surged in 2023 and 2024, thanks the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hike campaign. But at its highest point, the top savings account rate available to anyone in the country reached 5.55% APY in April 2024. What any bank offers in interest\u2014whether paid on a savings, checking, money market, or CD account\u2014will need to be reported on your annual tax return. You'll be able to see on your monthly statement or online register how much you were paid each month, and at the end of the calendar year, it will be taxed along with all of your other income from employment and other sources. The bank where you hold your high-yield savings account will not tax you directly, but in January of each year, they will send you and the IRS a Form 1099-INT indicating how much interest you were paid in the previous calendar year. You must then report this interest income on your tax return. The APY on a savings account is variable, meaning what it pays when you first open your account will most likely change sometime in the future, and it can change at any time without warning. Whether the rate goes up or down, and how often it changes, is largely influenced by the Federal Reserve. When the Fed adjusts the federal funds rate, banks and credit unions often follow suit in the same direction. That said, rate changes among savings accounts are not typically a daily or weekly event. Barring recent moves by the Fed, rates often remain at the same level for weeks or months at a time. The risk of losing money in a high-yield savings account is very low. Banks and credit unions are typically insured by the FDIC or NCUA. Interest rates on high-yield savings accounts are variable, but they are guaranteed based on the balance in the account (the bank won't take that money back after paying it to you). So if you're worried that a high-yield savings account comes with the same risk as investing in the stock market, think again. These accounts are much safer and there's virtually no risk of losing money in the account (unless you spend it of course). There are few drawbacks to putting some of your money into a high-yield savings account. The primary downside is that your money will likely reside at a different institution than where you do your primary banking. As a result, you may not be able to instantaneously transfer money from your high-yield savings to your primary checking account, as transfers between banks generally take 1-3 days. This issue can be easily handled, however, by making sure you keep some level of cash cushion at the bank where you have your checking, enabling you to make a quick transfer to checking if you need it. Every business day, we check the savings account rate for about 100 banks and credit unions that offer their accounts to customers nationwide.

Earning 12% interest on money in the U.S. is very rare and may not be doable at all in an FDIC- or NCUA-insured account. You may be able to earn 12% interest from a foreign bank account, but be very careful as your money may not be backed or insured by any government entity like it is in the U.S. You may be able to earn 12% returns by investing with a brokerage platform, but investing in the stock market is never a guaranteed way to earn returns. Your best bet is putting your money in a savings account or a CD that pays 5% to maximize returns before interest rates drop. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of about 100 banks and credit unions that offer high-yield savings accounts to customers nationwide. We determine daily rankings of the top-paying savings accounts first and foremost by the annual percentage rate (APY) offered. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. If the savings account is accessible only through a mobile app, we require that the app be available on both the iOS and Android platforms.

            "title": "Besides a Savings Account, Where Is the Safest Place To Keep My Money?",
            "content": "Amy Fontinelle has more than 15 years of experience covering personal finance, corporate finance and investing. Several good alternatives to savings accounts include certificates of deposit (CDs), money market accounts (MMAs), and U.S. government securities. These are all relatively safe places to invest your money, with deposits guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). CDs, MMAs, and U.S. government securities also offer some return on your money in the form of interest. If you prioritize keeping your money safe, you may want to ensure easy access and relatively low fees above high returns\u2014but there are many safe accounts with good yields. See the best CD rates or best MMA rates available today, or learn how to buy Treasury bonds and bills. If you're still considering savings accounts, check what you could earn with the best high-yield savings accounts. Where is the safest place to put your cash? You could put it under your mattress, but there are actually safer places to store your money. With the right type of account, you can protect your funds while also earning a return. A savings account is an ideal place to keep your cash safe and earn a yield. Let's explore nine other safe places to keep your money. Investopedia / Danie Drankwalter Certificates of deposit issued by banks and credit unions carry up to $250,000 in deposit insurance (assuming the bank or credit union is insured). A CD requires you to lock up your investment for a specified period, from several months to several years. You can't add more money to the CD during this time. You'll usually pay a penalty if you want to access your money before the CD matures. The penalty varies but usually adds up to several months' interest. However, many CD types are available, including no-penalty CDs, step-up CDs, and raise-your-rate CDs, which can help relieve the interest rate or term-length risks. Typically, CDs with longer terms pay more interest than CDs with shorter terms, although this isn't always true. Depending on the current rate environment, you may find that CDs tend to have better rates than savings accounts, or vice versa. A CD ladder can help grow your earnings while providing periodic access to your money. With a CD ladder strategy, you open several CDs with different maturities. For example, you might open one 6-month CD, one 12-month CD, and one 18-month CD. As each CD matures, you can decide whether to withdraw or reinvest the money. This strategy may offer you greater flexibility and less risk than opening one CD (with one maturity date). Even savings accounts aren't totally risk-free. For example, if you leave your money in a savings account earning a low interest rate, your money's growth may not keep up with inflation. After considering inflation, the $1,000 you put in last year may be worth less next year. You might also miss out on earning a higher return elsewhere. Money market accounts are FDIC- or NCUA-insured, up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank. They earn interest and combine many of the features of checking and savings accounts, making them a good choice if you want to grow your money while maintaining easy access to it. MMAs typically come with debit cards and limited check-writing privileges. Money market accounts often have fees, along with minimum opening deposit requirements and minimum balance requirements. Transaction and withdrawal limits may apply. The best money market account rates may rival those of the best CDs and savings accounts. U.S. Treasury bills, also called T-bills, are federal, short-term debt obligations\u00a0with a maturity of one year or less. Treasury securities may pay interest at higher rates than savings accounts, although it depends on the security's duration. The longer the maturity, the more interest the investor typically earns. Investors can purchase T-bills in increments of $100 through the secondary market in various ways, such as through a broker or investment bank or at auction on the\u00a0TreasuryDirect.gov website. U.S. Treasury bonds, also referred to as T-bonds, take the longest to mature among government-issued securities. U.S. government securities\u2014such as Treasury notes, bills, and bonds\u2014have historically been considered extremely safe because the U.S. government has never defaulted on its debt. Treasury bonds generally pay the highest interest rates. They are offered to investors for a term of 20 or 30 years to maturity. Investors can purchase T-bonds at monthly online auctions held directly by the U.S. Treasury, with initial offerings and reopenings alternating throughout the year. Although there are valid reasons to sell early, you could lose money if you sell a U.S. government security before it matures. Investors need to consider their timelines carefully before buying. U.S. Treasury notes, also called T-notes, are similar to T-bonds. The difference is that T-notes are offered in a wide range of terms (from two years to 10 years). While T-notes do not usually generate yields as high as T-bonds, they do generate a payment for investors twice a year (or every six months). You can purchase T-notes in increments of $100. Checking accounts are safe places to keep your money because they are FDIC insured for up to $250,000, per account. If you have more money than that, you can consider putting the remainder in an account with another bank. Checking accounts generally earn fairly low interest compared to other options for where to put your cash. But you can compare the rates on some checking accounts with the highest yields. Corporate bonds are not backed by a government, they're backed by companies. As a result, they often carry higher risk. However, many corporate bonds from established companies are considered safe investments, and they can provide a higher yield than government bonds. Municipal bonds are backed by state or local governments, not the federal government. Like Treasuries, municipal bonds offer a safe place to put your cash and a way to get reliable income. Gold can fluctuate in price, but is generally considered a safe investment as it's value has steadily increased over time. Keep in mind that there is no guarantee that gold's price will remain stable or rise. You can invest in gold in several ways, including by buying bullion or buying into a mutual fund that invests in gold or gold companies. The 10 smartest place to keep your money are:  What's best for you will depend on how easily you want to withdraw your money, whether you want your funds to be insured, and your target returns. You have several options for keeping your money secure. You can keep your money in a checking account, savings account, money market account, or bond, among many other low-risk investment choices. That way, your money will be secure and can potentially earn interest. As long as the financial institution is insured by the FDIC or NCUA, the money you put into a deposit account at a bank or credit union is insured for up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank. If the bank collapses or fails, you can still get your money back within a few days of the bank's closure. If you have more than $250,000, you may want to spread it throughout multiple banks to avoid uninsured deposits. Deposit accounts\u2014like savings accounts, CDs, MMAs, and checking accounts\u2014are a safe place to keep money because consumer deposits are insured for up to $250,000, either by the FDIC or NCUA. If you want to store cash at home, you might consider keeping it with copies of your important paper documents in a waterproof, fireproof safe. If you're seeking a safe place to keep your money besides a savings account, you have several alternatives to explore. Consider how soon and how often you might need to access your cash\u2014many options don't offer the liquidity of a savings account. Depending on the account, you might face withdrawal limits or pay a penalty to withdraw your money before the account reaches maturity.

            "title": "How Interest Works on a Savings Account",
            "content": "Compound interest has a snowball effect Interest on a savings account is the amount of money a bank or financial institution pays on your deposits. Compound interest is when interest is added to your deposit, then interest is calculated on that new higher amount. Compound interest on a savings account is calculated on principal and earned interest from previous periods. Essentially your earnings are reinvested and future interest is earned on the higher amount. Learn more about how interest on a savings account works, including how banks use your savings deposits to fund loans. Savings account interest rates can help you grow your money. A bank essentially borrows money from their depositors by using the deposited funds to lend money to other customers. In turn, the bank pays the depositor interest for their savings account balance while simultaneously charging their loan customers a higher interest rate than what was paid to their depositors. If you reinvest the interest you earned on your savings account and the initial amount deposited, you'll earn even more money in the long term. Compounding is when you earn interest on your savings plus interest on all of the accumulated interest from previous periods. You can use the concept of compounding interest to build up your savings and create wealth. Interest on savings accounts is expressed in percentage terms. For example, let's say you have $1,000 in the bank. The account might earn 2.5% interest. Most banks paid less than 1% interest on savings accounts in the between 2021 and 2022 due to historically low interest rates. However, in March 2022, the Fed began raising rates after a two-year period of near-zero interest rates. In a straightforward interest calculation, $1,000 in a savings account that earns 1% interest in one year would yield $1,010 (or .01 x 1,000) at the end of the year. However, that calculation is based on simple interest, paid only on the principal or the deposited funds. Some investors, such as retirees, might withdraw the earned interest or transfer it to another account. The interest payments act as a form of income. If the interest is withdrawn, the depositor's account will earn simple interest since no interest would be earned on any past interest. However, some depositors may opt to leave the interest earned in their savings accounts to earn more interest. Investopedia / Yurle Villegas In savings accounts, interest can be compounded, either daily, monthly, or quarterly. The more frequently interest is added to your balance, the faster your savings will grow. Using an example of a $1,000 deposit and applying daily compounding every day, the amount that earns interest grows by another 1/365th of 1%. At the end of the year, the deposit would grow to $1,010.05 versus $1,010 via simple interest. Of course, an extra $0.05 doesn't sound like much, but at the end of 10 years, your $1,000 would grow to $1,105.17 with compound interest. The 1% interest rate, compounded daily for 10 years, has added more than 10% to the value of your investment. Again, the amount earned still might not seem like much, but consider what would happen if you could save $100 a month and add it to the original $1,000 deposit. After one year, you would have earned $16.05 in interest, for a balance of $2,216.05. After 10 years, still adding just $100 a month, you would have earned $725.50, for a total of $13,725.50. A savings account can keep your assets safe from fluctuations in the stock market and real estate values. It's essentially an emergency fund that can be used for unexpected expenses such as medical bills or car repairs. The money in a savings account is considered more liquid than money in other accounts like CDs because you can access it quickly. Keep in mind that savings accounts, while a safe place for your money, tend to offer lower rates of return than investing in assets like stocks or bonds. Compound interest can build wealth over time, even when interest rates are at rock bottom. If you're considering opening an account, you can find the current rates banks online. Some banks specialize in high-yield savings accounts. The best savings accounts include those offered by banks where interest on the account is compounded daily, and no monthly fees are charged. Banks often state their interest rates as annual percentage yield (APY), reflecting the effects of compounding. The APY and annual percentage rate (APR) are not the same. The APR doesn't include compounding. To calculate simple interest on a savings account, you'll need the account's APY and the amount of your balance. The formula for calculating interest on a savings account is: Balance x Rate x Number of years = Simple interest. Compound is interest on your interest, or reinvesting accumulated interest from previous periods. Simple interest is paid only on the principal or the deposited funds. Investors can use the concept of compounding interest to build up their savings and create wealth. If you reinvest the interest you earned on your savings account and the initial amount deposited, you'll earn even more money in the long term. Depending on the type of account or product, interest is typically compounded monthly, quarterly, or annually. Interest can also be compounded weekly or daily. Putting your money in a savings account that earns interest can help you build wealth faster while protecting your money. Understanding how interest works on a savings account and how to compare different interest rates can help you choose the best savings account for you. Consider consulting with a professional financial advisor on how to best budget for your financial goals.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. A high-yield savings account is a type of savings account that can pay up to 15 times the national average of a standard savings account. The competition on savings rates has skyrocketed, creating a new category of high-yield savings accounts. A high-yield savings account differs in a few ways, but there's one thing it has in common with traditional savings accounts that is important for all to know. Traditional savings accounts and their high-yield counterparts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Association (NCUA). When you open an account at a bank or credit union, all of your accounts combined are insured for up to $250,000. Many brokerages offer cash management accounts (CMAs), which function similarly to high-yield savings accounts. The CMA usually offers a lower rate, but they do offer bill payment and ATM debit cards. The difference in interest between high-yield savings account rates and the national average is significant. For instance, if you're holding $5,000 in a conventional savings account, and the national average rate is 0.46% annual percentage yield (APY), you would earn $23.05 over a year. If you instead put that same $5,000 in an account earning 4.50%, you'd earn $229 in interest. The same can be said of high-yield checking accounts. However, checking accounts of this nature usually require you to hold a significant balance and use a debit card frequently. A high-yield savings account has a variable interest rate that can change over time. It also allows you to withdraw money when you need it. Your bank may have withdrawal limits, so check what that is first before withdrawing frequently. Some of the best savings interest rates are found at online banks, where the institution doesn't have to pay brick-and-mortar overhead. So, to earn significantly more interest with your savings, you may need to hold your savings account at one institution and your checking account at another. Today's availability and execution speeds of electronic transfers between institutions make moving money between a checking account and a savings account relatively simple, even at different banks. Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar institutions that offer a one-stop shop for all your banking needs, banks offering high-yield savings accounts typically limit their features or offer few or no other products. Many don't offer checking accounts, and few provide ATM cards. Generally, you can make electronic bank transfers or mobile check deposits for withdrawals and deposits.

A high-yield savings account will likely comprise only a part of your overall financial portfolio. Consider how you'll best use the account with other accounts to fit your broader investment strategy. Determine how much cash to set aside according to your goals and budget. For instance, if your savings account is serving as an emergency fund, consider depositing at least three to six months' worth of living expenses and keeping it there until you need it. The strategy may differ if you use a high-yield account to save up for a large purchase, such as a house, a car, or a vacation. In that case, you may want to use a high-paying savings account to help you protect your principal while applying interest earnings to your savings goal. Having multiple savings accounts may help you more easily progress toward goals and keep your funds organized toward specific goals. Many banks allow you to open multiple savings accounts and even give them personalized nicknames like \"Car Fund,\" \"Hawaii Vacation,\" or something else. You may want to open a high-yield savings account to keep cash. Most checking accounts don't pay any interest, and those generally offer meager interest rates, so moving extra funds into savings when you don't need them can provide a higher monthly interest payment. However, a savings account's interest rate is variable. It can go up and down. If the Federal Reserve lowers the fed funds rate, you might not earn the same interest rate as last month. If you want a stable, fixed interest rate (in exchange for not touching it for a set period of time), consider opening a certificate of deposit (CD). Regardless of the account, remember that your interest earnings will be taxed each year. Whether you're shopping for a high-yield account at a new bank or opening one at your current bank, compare options across the marketplace. Differences in interest rates and fees can add up over time, especially if you're keeping a relatively large balance in savings. Here's what to look for and compare. How much interest does the account currently pay? Is it a standard rate or an introductory promotional rate? Savings account rates are variable and can be changed at any time. However, some accounts will specify that the currently advertised rate is only available for an initial period of time. How much money is required to open the account? Do you want to deposit the minimum deposit requirement? Some accounts have minimum or maximum initial balance thresholds for earning the promoted rate. How much money are you required to keep in the account? Falling below the minimum deposit requirement can result in fees, which offset the interest rate earnings. Does the bank or credit union charge any fees on this account? If so, how can you avoid them (maybe you always keep your balance above the minimum threshold)? Will the bank allow you to create links between your high-yield savings account and deposit accounts at other banks or brokerage firms? Are there restrictions on linking multiple accounts, or is there a waiting period for new accounts? What additional options, if any, are available for withdrawing funds? Can you withdraw funds from savings using an ATM card? If you want to deposit checks into the account, does the bank have a smartphone app that offers mobile check deposits? Otherwise, can you mail checks by snail mail or deposit checks at a fee-free ATM? Banks can compound interest daily, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually. More frequent compounding will theoretically increase your take-home yield. If you compare accounts by APY instead of annual interest rate, the compounding factor will already have been considered. If your bank offers a competitive, high-yield savings account, it should be easy to open a new account. It will likely be possible with little need to enter personal information because you will already be verified with the institution. If you're opening a savings account at a new institution, the process will be more involved but should still be simple. Almost all high-yield savings accounts can be opened online. You will likely need to complete an electronic application with key personal information. Have your driver's license, Social Security number, and primary bank account information on hand to transfer funds for your initial deposit. Online banks are offering the highest rates. Still, you may be able to open a high-yield savings account where you already bank. Compare rates and terms among several accounts. Research and compare factors such as initial deposit requirements, interest rates, minimum balance requirements, fees, links to other banks and/or brokerage accounts, access to your money, deposit options, and compounding methods. Yes. Consumer banking customers can withdraw or transfer cash out of a high-yield savings account. Previously, the law allowed you to only withdraw up to six times per month from a savings account. That law is no longer in effect, but some institutions may have their own rules concerning withdrawals. If you want certain returns, a CD is better as it offers a fixed interest rate over a specific period of time. You can even get a 3-year CD that pays the same rate for three years. A high-yield savings account's interest rate can go up or down, and there's no guarantee that the APY advertised today will still be in effect six months from now. If you want more access to your cash or are still building your savings, a high-yield savings account could be better. You can add to or withdraw funds anytime. With a CD, you'll generally pay an early withdrawal penalty if you need the cash. Consider carefully the pros and cons of certificates of deposit vs. savings accounts. A high-yield savings account can be an ideal place to keep money you are not using in the short term but that you want fairly easy access to. It offers higher returns than a traditional savings account and is low risk because your deposits are federally insured up to $250,000. Consider the pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts compared to your other options, such as investment accounts. Then, compare the terms of different accounts to find a high-yield savings account that best suits your goals and personal situation.

High-Yield Savings Accounts Typically Pay Many Times More Than the National Average Rate To find and open a high-yield savings account that's right for you, start with some research regarding rates, terms, and account features. Check our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings account rates to get a head start. Then, opening a new account is usually an easy process that can be completed online or in person at a bank or credit union. Below, you'll find featured savings and cash management accounts\u2014from banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions that use partner banks\u2014available from our partners, followed by information on how to find the highest savings account rates nationwide. Investopedia / Jake Shi Hundreds of savings accounts at banks and credit unions are accessible via the internet. If you hope to beat inflation, you may need to move funds into a high-yield savings account outside your primary bank. There's no limit to the number of checking and savings accounts you can have at multiple banks. That said, you may already bank at a top-paying institution. So, check what you can earn in a savings account at your existing bank or credit union. Then, review the top national high-yield savings account rates. Many of the top rates are offered by online banks. Internet-only banks don't carry the overhead costs of physical branches and often pay the most competitive deposit rates in the country. However, many brick-and-mortar institutions now offer separately-branded online banks with competitive rates. When shopping for rates, be sure to read the fine print regarding: Keeping your savings at a different institution, where it may take a bit more effort to access, may help you avoid the temptation of withdrawing from your account and reach your savings goals faster. After identifying rates of the top-paying savings accounts, it's time to figure out the right choice for you. If you find your existing bank's savings rate competitive and worthwhile, open a new account with your current bank. You'll enjoy the convenience of a single bank login, instantaneous transfers between checking and savings accounts, and a streamlined signup process. But if you're like most rate shoppers, you'll find that you can earn more by opening a savings account at a new institution. Top national rates are often 10 to 12 times higher than the national average rate. If a top rate is from a credit union, ensure you qualify. Banking at a credit union requires you to first become a member of that institution. Any credit union appearing on Investopedia's ranking of the top savings accounts accepts members nationwide, although some may require a small membership fee in the form of a charitable donation. Review any fees that may be associated with the institution's account. Common bank fees include: You may also want to research the institution by reviewing complaints regarding high-yield savings accounts in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Consumer Complaint Database. However, there are very few complaints\u2014only 53 out of over 5 million complaints total\u2014as the CFPB has taken action against companies that misrepresented high-yield savings accounts. Check to be sure that any institution you bank with is insured by the FDIC or NCUA, which federally protects up to $250,000 of your deposits at that institution. Once you've selected your new high-yield savings account institution, complete the required application, likely online. In most cases, it should only take 10 minutes or so. You will need to provide the institution with your: You'll also need to decide whether to open this account as a single individual or jointly with another person, such as your spouse. If you opt for a joint account, provide all of the second applicant's information, as well. You can visit a branch if you're opening an account at a physical bank in your community. But even with local institutions, you can likely open an account online. This saves you a trip to the branch and makes for a faster process than in-person with a banker. You must provide your Social Security number because your savings account interest earnings will be taxable income you must pay taxes on. Some institutions require you to set up an electronic transfer of funds from an outside account into your new account. You may be asked to do so immediately to fund the minimum initial deposit, while others allow you some time, and others don't have minimum deposit requirements. Ways to fund a new savings account include: Funding your new account from an existing bank account usually requires you to provide the institution's routing and account numbers. The online application may also ask for your bank's login credentials to instantly verify the account. If not, your new account may send two trial deposits to the account you're linking, which you'll use for account verification over the next few days. Once you've opened your new account, it's typically wise to enroll in online banking. You may be able to do this right away after completing your online application. For some banks and credit unions, you may have to wait a few days until you get an email or letter with the account information for online enrollment. As you set up online banking, note your username and password in a secure physical place or with password storage software. Then, set up the bank's app on your smartphone or tablet. Bank apps are free for customers. Within the app, you'll need to log in with your username and password to interact with your accounts. Unless you already did this during the application process, log in to your account and designate one or more beneficiaries. Beneficiaries are those you name to inherit your account balance should something happen to you. Almost all accounts allow for establishing a primary beneficiary. Many also accommodate secondary beneficiaries, who inherit the account balance if the primary beneficiary isn't alive. A typical scenario is to designate your spouse as the primary beneficiary (if they are not jointly named on the account) and your children as secondary beneficiaries. But your beneficiary choices are up to you and your situation. Review your choices for account alert options. You might want to get alerts regarding deposits or withdrawals over a certain amount or if your account balance drops below a designated amount. You can often choose whether activity alerts are sent by email, text, or notifications from the app. Also, consider whether you want electronic account statements. E-statements may offer more secure protection against identity theft, and some online-only banks may require opting into e-statements\u2014or charge a monthly fee if you request paper statements. If you set up a transfer for the initial deposit, you likely linked an external bank account to your new high-yield savings account. But with most accounts, you can link multiple external bank accounts. This can be useful if you bank at multiple institutions or often transfer funds to your children's accounts. Start the account linking process immediately so it's ready when you need it; the setup can take a few days. Lastly, understand all of your account's rules and requirements to avoid future fees. Fees could quickly eat into any interest returns. While some accounts have no monthly fees, others do have such fees. But there are usually specific actions you can take to avoid them. These actions could include: A high-yield savings account pays a much higher interest rate than other savings accounts. One reason these rates are typically higher is because they're offered by online-only banks, which have much lower overhead costs. Brick-and-mortar banks and credit unions sometimes offer high-yield accounts, but they are more common at online institutions. A high-yield savings account pays you interest on the money deposited in that account. However, institutions that offer the highest rewards may not provide other standard banking features and services, so you may need to have your checking account at a different location. Most high-yield savings accounts don\u2019t offer ATM cards, so incoming and outgoing money transfers happen via electronic transfer or mobile check deposit. You should consider opening a high-yield savings account if you like the account rates and terms, and you accept the bank's guidelines and limitations. A high-yield savings account could be a good fit for someone who doesn\u2019t mind the inconvenience of having multiple accounts at different banking institutions. High-yield savings accounts can be ideal for those who want to leave some extra money in the bank and don't need immediate access. They can be used for an emergency fund or to save up for a large purchase. There usually aren\u2019t many costs associated with high-yield savings accounts as long as you meet the minimum balance requirements and follow the account guidelines. High-yield savings accounts offer higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts. They\u2019re still insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for up to $250,000. High-yield savings accounts can be great for accumulating money for future purchases or emergencies, and they're usually quick and easy to open. Some of these financial institutions might also offer high-yield checking accounts. Typically, you'll find that your primary banking institution doesn't offer the best rates, so opening a new account at a different institution can be smart. Online-only banks tend to offer the best rates, although this isn't always true. You'll earn much more than a typical savings account, but keep an eye on fees that might eat up that interest.

            "title": "Tiered-Rate Accounts: Examples of How They Work",
            "content": "A tiered-rate account is a bank account that pays different rates of interest, depending on the amount of the funds held in it.\u00a0\u00a0It can be any type of account but usually is either a money market or a savings account. Generally, tiered-rate bank accounts will offer higher rates of interest for larger balances, in order to encourage customers to save and remain loyal to the bank in question. They also free the depositor from having to commit their funds for a specific term to get a better rate, as one must with a certificate of deposit (CD), for instance. Tiered-rate accounts work by offering different, or \"tiered,\" rates of interest for different levels of account savings, escalating the rates with higher balances. For instance, a bank might offer five fixed-interest-rate tiers on its money market account, all linked to how much you deposit initially. The lowest tier, or interest rate, is for balances $0 and $2,500. Then, once you get into more significant four figures, the interest rate jumps 0.05 percentage point. It increases another 0.05% for five-figure balances, and one more for balances that crack the six-figure barrier. And if you keep $500,000-plus in the account, you score the highest interest rate of all. Other banks might tether their interest rates to a reference rate or benchmark, offering larger spreads for the higher account balances. A tiered-rate account often requires a minimum balance to be opened as well as a minimum daily amount to be maintained, or a minimum monthly volume of transactions. For instance, a bank might offer a particularly high interest rate for accounts with frequent monthly transactions. In this situation, the bank is betting that it will generate enough fee revenue\u2014if your daily balance falls below the minimum, or you exceed the number of allowable transactions\u2014to offset the higher interest paid on the account. Tiered-rate accounts are designed to attract larger depositors and to encourage existing account holders to deposit larger sums. When it comes to five- and six-figure deposits, banks know they are competing with financial services firms and investment management companies, and with low-risk investment options like money market funds or government bond funds. So they have to offer returns at a comparable level. Ultimately, however, the main source of business for commercial banks is the practice of lending out the money deposited by account holders. If default rates are low and the bank can earn a higher rate of interest on their loans than they pay to their account holders, then the bank will be profitable. In this context, banks need to balance the need for attracting customers on the one hand while maintaining their own profitability on the other. For this reason, it is very unlikely that the interest rates offered by a bank will come close to matching the interest rates charged on their loans\u2014unless the fee schedule associated with that account is particularly expensive. The difference in interest between what a bank pays to its depositors and what it charges to its borrowers is known as its net interest margin. This is a key metric for assessing a bank's profitability. As such, it is closely watched by financial analysts. Emma is a longstanding customer at XYZ Financial, a national bank with several branches in her home city. One day, she receives a notice from XYZ indicating that the bank is offering a new savings account with a tiered interest-rate structure. Under the terms of this tiered-rate account, depositors are entitled to escalate interest rates on their deposits depending on the amount of money held in their account. Rather than providing fixed interest rates, however, XYZ offers variable rates calculated based on a spread against the prime interest rate. For instance, for deposits between $10,000 and $50,000, XYZ offers a rate of prime plus 0.25% as the account's annual percentage yield (APY); for deposits between $50,000 and $100,000, the rate is prime plus 0.50%; for deposits between $100,000 and $500,000, the rate is prime plus 0.75%; and lastly, for deposits above $500,000, the rate is prime plus 1%. Emma reasons correctly that this new incentive program is likely an effort by XYZ to attract and retain customers, particularly those with relatively large account balances. Moreover, she recognizes that the bank is likely able to lend out these deposits at higher rates of interest in order to maintain a positive net interest margin. Additional transaction fees and monthly charges implied in the offer add another source of revenue for the bank. A tiered-rate account is usually either a savings account or money market account. They pay different, or tiered, rates of interest, depending on how much money is held in the account. If you are looking for a savings account type to let your money grow and you don't need the funds for a while, a tiered-rate savings account might work well for you. Generally, tiered-rate accounts pay\u00a0different rates of interest depending on the amount of funds held in the account, and the rate increase with the size of the account. A bank might offer a particularly high interest rate for accounts with frequent monthly transactions, for example. But be aware that a tiered-rate account may require a minimum balance as well as a minimum daily amount to be maintained in the account. As a result, if your daily balance falls below the minimum, or you exceed the number of allowable monthly transactions, you'll be assessed fees. A tiered-rate account is a bank account, either checking, savings, or money market, which pays differing rates of interest based on the amount of funds held in it.\u00a0Usually, tiered-rate bank accounts will offer higher rates of interest for larger balances to encourage customers to save more and remain loyal to the bank. Banks need to balance attracting customers with maintaining their profitability. So it is very unlikely that the interest rates offered by a bank even for high-value tiered-rate accounts will approach the interest rates charged on their loans.

            "content": "Amy Fontinelle has more than 15 years of experience covering personal finance, corporate finance and investing. Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning. The Federal Reserve Board Regulation D set reserve requirements for financial institutions. This was a monetary policy tool that also previously imposed a six-per-month withdrawal limit on savings accounts. This limit was lifted in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and reserve requirement ratios were set to 0%. The Fed has advised that it has no plans to re-impose the withdrawal limit. The Fed Reg D restricted withdrawals or transfers from savings accounts to six per month. The same rule applied to money market accounts. Although the Fed has removed those limits, some banks still impose such limits\u2014and the number of allowed withdrawals can vary from bank to bank. The Federal Reserve Board is an independent government agency. Its seven members are in charge of the U.S. Federal Reserve system, which tries to keep the U.S. economy growing and the financial system stable. The Fed Reg D also governs the reserve requirements of depository institutions. Bank reserves are currency deposits that depository institutions keep on hand and do not lend out. This regulation helps the central bank when it comes time to implement its monetary policy. Reserve ratios were set to 0% during the pandemic. A depository institution is a place where people keep their money. We often refer to these institutions as commercial banks, savings institutions, or credit unions. These organizations hold your money safely until you need it back. They may pay you interest while holding your money. They may also lend it out to other customers in a way that doesn't prevent you from accessing your money when you need it. Fed Reg D is not the same as Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation D\u2014which governs private placement\u00a0exemptions. Financial institutions satisfy their reserve requirements in two ways. The first is by maintaining a certain amount of money in their own vaults. The second is by keeping a balance at their district's Federal Reserve Bank. A financial institution that fails to meet its reserve requirements may have to pay a reserve deficiency charge to its Federal Reserve Bank. This charge costs one percentage point above the primary credit rate that was borrowed. Regulation D ensures that banks have enough cash on hand to meet withdrawal requests by limiting how customers are able to use their savings accounts.\u00a0Although institutions aren't required to keep any reserves for customers' savings account balances, they must keep reserves for transaction accounts\u2014in other words, checking accounts. Although the withdrawal limit of Regulation D is no longer in place, your bank may still limit certain transactions, such as: You can get around this transaction limits still imposed by banks by making certain transfers and withdrawals. These are considered inconvenient transactions. Usually, if you use an ATM or a bank teller to move your money, no limits or fees apply. That said, some banks have stricter rules that don't exempt certain transactions. You'll have to read the terms and conditions of your account or ask customer service to see what rules apply to your specific account. Here are five strategies to keep your savings account withdrawals below the maximum and deal with your bank. While Regulation D provides minimum standards that banks must follow, banks can implement tighter criteria to determine when to charge customers for exceeding the six-transaction limit. Here are the policies of three of the countries' biggest banks. Regulation D was suspended due to COVID-19 in April 2020. There are no plans to resume Reg D, however, banks and financial institutions can still charge fees for withdrawals from money market or savings accounts. The Federal Reserve Board Regulation D is different from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation D. The Fed\u2019s Reg D sets reserve requirements and previously limited the number of monthly withdrawals from savings accounts. SEC Reg D relates to private placement exemptions\u2014allowing companies to raise capital without registering securities with the SEC. The Federal Reserve Board has advised that it has no plans to reimplement transfer limits related to Regulation D. Removal of the Reg D limit\u2014six withdrawals from savings or money market accounts each month\u2014was suspended in April 2020. Although there are no plans to reimpose the limit, the Fed notes that it could still change the definition of savings accounts in the future. If you are a customer who uses your savings account simply to make deposits and accumulate funds, you're likely safe from limits that banks may still impose. You can avoid excess transaction fees by making the most of your outgoing transfer and withdrawals from your checking account, not your savings account.

            "title": "How to Close a Savings Account",
            "content": "Erin Gobler is a personal finance coach and a writer with over decade of experience. She specializes in writing about investing, cryptocurrency, stocks, and more. Her work has been published on major financial websites including Bankrate, Fox Business, Credit Karma, The Simple Dollar, and more. Closing a bank account is a quick process that often can be done online, at your local branch, over the phone, or by submitting a particular form. As your banking needs or financial situation change, you might find yourself needing to do this. Sometimes people might close and move all their accounts to a different bank. But in other cases, you may want to maintain a relationship with your current bank and only close your savings account. Find out more about how this is done. There are several reasons why you might decide to close your savings account. In some cases, you may be closing all your accounts with a particular bank. However, someone often wants to close only their savings account without fully severing ties with the bank. Here are some reasons why you might close a savings account: While you may simply be able to move your money to a different savings account and keep your current one open, this isn\u2019t always an option. Some banks have minimum balance requirements, meaning that if you withdraw all your money from the account, you\u2019ll no longer be able to keep it open. Closing a savings account is usually a simple process. Here are the steps you\u2019ll have to take: Some banks may allow you to close your account via your online dashboard, but many require that you actually speak with a customer service representative. While the steps above are usually sufficient for closing an individual savings account, there are some special circumstances that may require additional steps. If you have a savings account that has become inactive or dormant\u2014this may happen when you haven\u2019t used it for a year or more\u2014then it may be more difficult to close. Rather than simply being able to close the account, you may have to contact the bank to reactivate the account before you can move forward with closing it. If you have no transactions with your account for three to five years, it may be considered abandoned or unclaimed. In this case, the account could be closed and any money in it sent to your state\u2019s unclaimed property program. An overdrawn account is one that has a negative balance because you\u2019ve spent more than you had in the account or accrued fees that brought your account to a negative amount. In most cases, you won\u2019t be able to close an account with an overdrawn balance. Instead, you\u2019ll have to bring the balance to zero and then can proceed with closing it. To close the bank account of a deceased person, you\u2019ll first have to prove that you have the authority to do so. It\u2019s easiest to do this if you are listed as a co-owner on the account, as you\u2019ll be able to have the deceased owner removed by showing a death certificate. In cases where there is no co-owner listed in the bank account, you\u2019ll probably need to provide a death certificate. You may also need a legal document to show that you\u2019re the executor of the estate and have the authority to close the account on behalf of the decedent. If the estate isn\u2019t going through a formal probate process and doesn\u2019t require an executor, you may be able to provide a small-estate affidavit in certain states. A joint account is one that has more than one owner. Depending on your bank and how you\u2019re closing the account, you may need both account owners to close it. A bank may require that both owners be present if you\u2019re closing the account in person. Or you may both need to sign the letter if you\u2019re closing the account via mail. But in other cases, one account holder may simply be able to close the account without the other\u2019s consent. A custodial account is one that an adult opens on behalf of a minor. The person who opened the account serves as its custodian and has full control of the account until the beneficiary reaches the age of majority (from 18 to 25, depending on the state). Once you\u2019ve deposited money into a custodial account, you can\u2019t take it back. It\u2019s an irrevocable gift to the child. Closing the account and moving the money into your own bank account could put you in legal trouble. However, you could move the money to a new custodial account at a different financial institution. Additionally, if you are the beneficiary of such an account and have reached the age of majority, you can withdraw the money and close the account. Because each financial institution has a different process for closing custodial accounts or transferring the funds, you\u2019ll have to contact yours to start the process. If you\u2019re planning to close your savings account, there are a few additional steps that you should take once the account is closed. If you have any checkbooks, debit cards, or ATM cards for the savings account that you\u2019re closing, be sure to destroy them. You wouldn\u2019t necessarily have to worry about someone finding and using them, but you can avoid accidentally writing a check or trying to use a card from an account that\u2019s no longer active. Once your account is closed, you may not be able to access your old bank statements (though some banks keep them available for a certain number of days). Before closing your account, download previous bank statements in case you need to reference them. Even when your account is closed, you want to ensure that the bank can reach you with important documents, including tax forms. Before closing your account, make sure your mailing address and other contact information are correct. If you have any automated transactions set up, including direct deposits, scheduled transfers, or online bill payments, you\u2019ll want to cancel those. The best-case scenario is that the automated transaction simply won\u2019t go through. But if you have direct deposit going into the savings account, you could experience a delay in receiving your paycheck. And if you use that savings account for bills, you could end up with a late fee when the payment can\u2019t go through. There usually won\u2019t be a fee associated with closing a savings account. However, your bank or credit union may charge a fee if you\u2019re closing an account that you just recently opened. In most cases, you can close your savings account at any time. However, you may not be able to close it if your account is overdrawn or if you owe fees on the account. As long as you\u2019re the owner of the bank account, you should only need to present photo identification to close your account. In fact, if you\u2019re closing the account online or over the phone, you may not need any documentation at all. However, some banks may require that you fill out and submit a signed account-closing document. Some savings accounts can be closed immediately. However, the process may take a bit longer depending on whether you have an account balance, transactions that need to clear, or based on the method you use to close your account. Generally speaking, closing a bank account won\u2019t affect your credit. Bank accounts aren\u2019t a part of your credit report. However, if you have outstanding fees at your old bank and fail to pay them, they could be sent to collections and would then appear on your credit report and hurt your credit score. Closing a savings account is usually a simple process, but there are some circumstances that can complicate it. Whether you\u2019re transferring the account to get a better interest rate, maintaining other accounts at the same bank, or switching all your accounts to a different bank, make sure you have a plan for your money. Be certain that all money has been successfully transferred to your new account before you close your existing accounts.

Ally Bank offers the most comprehensive and rewarding free savings account Free savings accounts give you a place to park money you don't need to access regularly, and they do so without charging fees that would eat into your hard-earned savings. These accounts can be opened in tandem with a checking account\u2014where you keep the money you spend on a day-to-day basis\u2014or they can be opened as stand-alone savings accounts and linked to an outside checking account. We picked Ally Bank's Online Savings Account as the best free savings account overall thanks to its high interest rate, minimal fees, and useful extra features. The best accounts should help you work toward your financial goals.\u00a0 This might mean earning a generous interest rate to boost your savings, or offering handy tools to help you save more such as recurring transfers. The best free savings accounts don't require a minimum balance, and will often have low or no minimum opening deposit requirements. Ideally, they'll come with extra features that encourage you to budget and save more. Here are the best free savings accounts. Ally Bank Ally Bank wins as the best overall free savings account thanks to its high APY, minimal fees, and extra features that help you boost your savings rate. High APY No fees or account minimums Savings boosters and buckets help you increase your savings rate No ATM card No physical branches $20 fee for outgoing domestic wire transfers Ally Bank's Online Savings Account comes with no minimum opening deposit requirement, no minimum balance requirements, and no monthly service fees. On top of that, you'll earn a generous 4.00% APY to help you build your savings account balance. Ally Bank has a few unique features that encourage you to increase your savings rate. Rather than having to open multiple accounts for different savings goals, Ally Bank lets you create \"savings buckets\" within your account that you can nickname and distribute your money across. Their savings boosters include recurring transfers, round-ups, and the ability to link a checking account to let Ally analyze where you have a little wiggle room in your budget to save more. This bank is fully online, which means they're able to offer products with lower fees and higher returns. However, it also means you won't be able to visit any physical branches. Finally, this savings account doesn't come with an ATM card, but you can open a linked Ally checking account if you want to have immediate access to your savings. Funds kept with Ally Bank are FDIC-insured on up to $250,000. Read the full Ally Bank review. Axos Bank No other free savings account offers an APY that's this consistently high. Plus, you don't have to maintain a minimum balance to earn it, which is why Axos Bank's High Yield Savings wins for best high-yield. High APY No monthly fees or account minimums Free ATM card upon request $250 minimum opening deposit Lower APY on balances of $25,000 or more No physical branches If you're looking for high yields on your savings, it's hard to beat 0.61%, so Axos Bank is the best option for high-yield free savings. You don't have to pay any monthly fees or maintain a minimum balance to earn interest, and while there is a minimum opening deposit, $250 is still doable for many. You'll also get a free ATM card upon request so you can access your funds easily. That said, the APY goes down to 0.25% if your account balance is $25,000 or higher. If you have more than $100,000 in your account, you'll only earn 0.15%. Thus, this account is best for balances below $25,000. Once you've leveled up past $25,000, you can keep additional funds in another savings account or consider other high yield products like a certificate of deposit (CD) or money market account. Axos is FDIC-insured, so your funds are protected on up to $250,000. This bank is online-only, so it's best for people who are comfortable using online and mobile banking. Read the full Axos Bank review. Synchrony Synchrony Bank has one of very few high-yield savings accounts that come with the option to get a free ATM card. You can use it at Accel's network of nearly 70,000 surcharge-free ATMs, and you'll even get up to $5 per statement cycle in ATM fee rebates, which is why Synchrony's savings account is the best for ATM access.

These features make Synchrony the right choice for anyone who prioritizes ATM access. Synchrony Bank doesn't offer any checking accounts, but with the ATM access this savings account offers, you might not need one.

Ally Bank's Online Savings Account has all of this, which is why it wins as best overall. Anyone can open a free savings account with Ally and grow their savings faster thanks to the bank's 1.00% APY and savings boosters like the ability to round up purchases into your savings or have Ally analyze a linked checking account for missed savings opportunities. The online and mobile banking experience is flawless, and you know your money is protected thanks to this account's FDIC insurance. The best free savings accounts should make it easier for you to save money. Here are some key features to pay attention to: Free savings accounts are often offered by online banks, and they don't charge any monthly fees. On top of that, they often feature a higher interest rate and have lower opening deposit requirements. Traditional savings accounts are offered by big, national banks and typically charge a monthly maintenance fee to keep the account open. You can often get the fee waived by maintaining a minimum balance, but if your balance dips below that requirement even for a month, you'll be charged a fee. Traditional savings accounts typically offer very low or almost no interest (a 0.01% APY is common) and have higher opening deposit requirements. In the News: The Federal Reserve reported that 6% of adults in the U.S. were unbanked in 2022, meaning no one in the household had access to a checking, savings, or money market account. The most common reasons for not having an account include not being able to meet bank minimum deposit requirements and being wary of account fees, so a free savings account can be a significant benefit for those worried about cost. Low account minimums No monthly fees Potentially high APYs Often no physical branches Cash deposits may not be available Other fees may apply A free savings account can be a useful and low-cost tool to save money, but there may be other options that provide higher yields or added functionality. \"If you're just starting to build an emergency fund or want a safe place for cash you may need in the next year or two, savings accounts and money market accounts are solid choices,\" said Ryan Greiser, CFP, a member of Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council. \"But if you\u2019re in a higher tax bracket or have a larger sum to stash, consider whether more tax-advantaged options might be better suited for your goals. At the end of the day, it\u2019s about balance: how much liquidity you need vs. how much growth you\u2019re chasing.\" If you want your money to grow as much as possible, an HYSA may be a useful alternative to a free savings account. These accounts allow you to earn a significantly higher APY on your savings. And, if you meet monthly balance requirements, the monthly fees may be waived. Check out the best high-yield savings accounts to see how much you could earn. The rates on savings accounts are not fixed (like a certificate of deposit), so their APYs change over time. If you want to lock in a higher APY, a CD can help you grow your savings. They typically have higher rates than savings accounts because you commit to leaving your money in the account for a specific length of time. If you withdraw money before the CD's maturity date, you may have to pay early withdrawal penalties. The best CD rates are often above 5% in various terms, giving you many options to choose from. Money market accounts are another type of deposit account you can use to grow your savings. These accounts tend to have higher APYs than savings accounts, but they're more flexible and accessible than CDs. Savings bonds are another way to earn a higher yield on your money. Bonds provide a guaranteed rate of interest, and terms can be as long as 30 years. Free savings accounts can earn interest, but the bank or credit union may limit how often you can withdraw money from the account. If you want an account that earns interest and allows you to make withdrawals whenever you want, a high-yield checking account could be a good choice. According to the Federal Reserve Economic Database, the average personal savings rate was 3.9% in May 2024. Many banks and credit unions, particularly online banks, offer free savings accounts. Some of the best options include: Free savings accounts may offer higher yields than traditional savings accounts. There are plenty of free savings accounts offering a 0.40% to 0.50% APY, while traditional savings accounts might only offer around 0.08%.Still, those rates are far lower than what you can earn with the best high-yield savings accounts. Free savings accounts are usually FDIC-insured\u2014which provides $250,000 in coverage\u2014but it depends on the bank. While this is the standard, some online banks are able to offer a higher level of FDIC insurance by spreading your funds across multiple program banks. For example, if they have your $1 million balance spread equally across four program banks that are each FDIC-insured on up to $250,000, you might be able to get your full $1 million insured. Some free savings accounts offer ATM access, but not all. If a free savings account doesn't offer an ATM card, you can usually open a checking account with that same bank for ATM access. Typical bank savings accounts, including free savings accounts and HYSAs, are not tax-free. The interest you earn on your savings account is taxable as income. If you're looking for a tax-free way to save for future goals, consider opening a Roth IRA or Health Savings Account instead. Depending on current rates, it may be possible to find a high-yield savings account with an APY as high as 5.00%. However, rates can and do change over time. Explore the best CD rates if you want to lock in a specific rate for a long period of time. No, in most cases you can't lose money in a savings account. As long as the financial institution is FDIC or NCUA-insured, up to $250,000 of your money is protected by the federal government. It is possible to be charged fees, however, which may be greater than the amount of interest you earn. It's also possible that you may not be getting the best rate available, so you're losing money compared to what you could earn. And, if your interest rate is less than the current inflation rate, your overall purchasing power is going down. Savings accounts are often compared to CDs and money market accounts. The best CDs may pay better than the best savings accounts, because you have to leave your money untouched for a period of time, but that isn't always true\u2014rates change frequently. It's worth exploring the best high-yield savings accounts, the best CD rates, and the best money market account rates when looking for a new home for your money. We considered more than 20 free savings accounts, mostly offered by online banks and credit unions, when researching this list. To narrow it down to the best free savings accounts, we looked for those with the lowest fees and highest rates as well as any extras that could help consumers save more. We only considered genuinely free savings accounts, which means any account that charged a monthly maintenance fee was automatically off the list, even if it was waivable. Keeping your funds protected is also important, so we only included savings accounts that are FDIC-insured (or NCUA-insured for credit unions).

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Savings accounts can be a rewarding way for your child or teen to learn about money. We've been researching the best kid and teen bank accounts since 2021, starting with a pool of almost two dozen options. These accounts are educational and child-friendly, and after hours reviewing interest rates, fees, balance requirements, and special features designed for kids and parents, the best overall pick is Capital One's Kids Savings Account. Capital One wins for offering interest on all balance amounts, the ability for kids to upgrade to a checking account as they get older, and the option for young savers to set up specific savings goals in the app. We also give high marks to USAlliance Financial, Alliant Credit Union, and Spectrum Credit Union. Also in the market for a great savings account for adults? Our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts will take you to the Top 15 rates that are available nationwide. Capital One With interest paid on any balance amount, excellent mobile banking tools, the ability to establish multiple savings goals, and the option to grow into a youth checking account with a debit card, Capital One\u2019s Kids Savings Account is our winner for the all-around best youth savings account. Interest is paid on any balance No minimum balance and no fees A top-rated mobile app that includes parental controls Availability of a Teen Checking Account with debit card Interest rate is lower than other options Multiple savings goals require opening multiple accounts No ATM fee refunds on the checking account Capital One has put more thought and effort into youth banking than a lot of its competitors, creating not only two account types for kids and teens but investing resources into developing kid- and parent-centric mobile app experiences specific to these accounts. Combined with no minimum balance to earn interest, no fees, and the ability to advance to a teen account with a debit card, these features make Capital One our overall pick for Best Kids Savings Account. No matter how much or how little your child has in their savings account, Capital One pays the same rate. Though it typically isn't the highest rate you can earn on a youth account, the absence of a minimum or maximum balance makes it versatile. In addition, if your child moves into or adds a Teen Checking Account at Capital One, they\u2019ll earn a little bit of interest on that account balance, too. Interacting with the account is enhanced for both kids and parents by the well-designed mobile banking app, which enables automatic transfers from parent accounts to the youth account (think automated allowance payments) and the establishment of savings goals that will motivate your child to keep saving. The app is even more robust for the Teen Checking Account, offering separate parent and teen interfaces and providing parental controls. Capital One\u2019s Teen Checking Account is slightly misnamed, as it\u2019s available to any child age eight or older. This provides earlier access to a debit card than accounts that reserve this feature for kids ages 13 and up. See the full Capital One review. Capital One is the 8th largest U.S. bank by assets, offering various banking products online to customers nationwide. FDIC-insured since 1934, Capital One is headquartered in McLean, Virginia. USAlliance For parents starting their child\u2019s account at a very young age, it\u2019s hard to do better than USAlliance\u2019s MyLife Savings for Kids account. Its annual birthday bonus for pre-teen savers helps make it our top savings account choice for young children. $10 in \u201cbirthday bucks\u201d paid every year through age 12 Competitive interest rate on the first $500 Ability to move into a checking account at age 13 Joining the credit union is easy and virtually free No ATM or debit card access until age 13 Credit union membership is required for both parent and child Some other accounts pay interest on the whole balance USAlliance understands how much children love birthday gifts, and parlays that into a reward for kids having their own savings account. By paying those under 13 a $10 birthday bonus every year, plus a generous interest rate on their first savings, USAlliance\u2019s MyLife Savings for Kids wins our award for best youth account for young savers. The earlier you open one of these for your child, the more \u201cbirthday bucks\u201d they\u2019ll score. They\u2019ll also earn a highly competitive 2.00% APY on their balances up to $500. Very few youth accounts currently pay above 1%, so the earning potential here is significantly higher than most other options. USAlliance also offers a MyLife Checking for Teens, allowing your child to add the more advanced account as they mature. They can open a MyLife Checking at age 13, and choose to receive an ATM or debit card at that time. Meanwhile, they can retain their MyLife Savings account to continue earning a high interest rate on up to $500 in savings. Though USAlliance Financial is a credit union, it is open for anyone nationwide to join. Originally established in 1966 to serve IBM employees, USAlliance is headquartered in Rye, New York. Today, anyone can join the credit union by agreeing to a free membership in the nonprofit American Consumer Council and keeping at least $1 in a savings account. Alliant Credit Union Alliant Credit Union starts your child\u2019s saving journey outright with a competitive interest rate, no fees, and an excellent mobile banking app designed for kids and parents. Then as your child ages, Alliant\u2019s Teen Checking provides even more useful features, making it our pick for the best savings account for teens. Competitive interest rate Mobile banking app that provides child- and parent-friendly features Teen checking account with debit card available at age 13 Teen checking pays interest and offers ATM fee refunds Interest is only paid when balance is $100 or more No ATM or debit card before age 13 Some youth accounts pay higher interest, although only on limited balances For younger children, learning how to bank is an evolving process, and Alliant provides an excellent Stage 1 option with its Kids Savings Account, followed by an even more impressive Stage 2 option with its Teen Checking Account. Both pay competitive interest and offer well-designed mobile app experiences geared specifically toward kids and parents. An Alliant Kids Savings Account can be opened for children 12 and younger. Anytime the account balance exceeds $100, Alliant will pay a respectable 3.10% APY (as of May 2023) with no maximum balance for earning that rate. The account can be accessed with a mobile banking app that has parents and kids in mind; it lets parents set automated recurring deposits into their child\u2019s account and allows the child to monitor their balance, deposit birthday checks, and track progress toward a savings goal. Once your child turns 13, they can add an Alliant Teen Checking Account and ATM/debit card. This is one of the best youth checking accounts nationally available, paying more interest on checking balances than most other accounts. The account has a 0.25% APY. What\u2019s more, Alliant offers free ATM transactions at more than 80,000 ATMs nationwide, as well as up to $20 per month in ATM fee reimbursements. Though Alliant is a credit union, joining is open to everyone and is both easy and free. In fact, Alliant will even contribute the $5 initial deposit into your child\u2019s savings account. Originally founded in 1935 to serve employees of United Airlines, anyone can now join Alliant Credit Union by agreeing to a free membership in the nonprofit Foster Care to Success. Alliant is headquartered in Chicago. Spectrum Credit Union With the interest rate on Spectrum\u2019s youth savings account so high it looks like a typo, the credit union earns our top marks for maximum interest earnings in a kid's account. Pays the highest nationally available APY on a savings account, on your first $1,000 Account can be held until age 21 Account holders age 13 and up can request an ATM card No accompanying teen checking account available Limited to one MySavings Youth Account per individual Joining the credit union is not free for most people With bank interest rates as low as they currently are, it\u2019s hard to believe Spectrum\u2019s youth savings account rate of 7% APY. However, this rate only applies to balances up to $1,000. This is the highest rate we found (by a mile) for any nationally available youth savings account (or adult account, for that matter), making it an easy choice for the best youth account to maximize interest. Spectrum doesn\u2019t offer a teen checking account, but it does allow kids to keep their MySavings Youth Account (and its stellar interest rate) longer than most other banks do, all the way through the age of 21. It also allows those ages 13 and up to opt for an ATM card. Account balances above $1,000 revert to the Primary Share Savings APY of 0.75%. As a credit union, Spectrum does require joining in order to open an account, and though the process is easy, it is not free. Unless someone in your family is eligible through their employer or geographical residency, individuals must pay membership fees or donations to an affiliated nonprofit organization to gain Spectrum eligibility. In addition, a member must hold $25 in a savings account (though you will get this back should you ever end your credit union membership). One side note is that Spectrum has a sister institution, Chevron Federal Credit Union. Though the eligibility rules are the same for those who don\u2019t qualify another way, Chevron is open to a different set of employees and geographical residents, so it\u2019s worth checking if you qualify for one or the other to avoid paying. Founded as Bechtel Employees Federal Credit Union in 1973, Spectrum is among the largest credit unions in the U.S. Today, anyone can join the Concord, Calif., credit union by donating $15 to the Contra Costa County Historical Society and keeping $25 or more in a savings account. When shopping for a bank account for kids that pays interest, offers a well-designed parent- and kid-focused mobile experience, and provides an easy on-ramp for your child to advance to teen checking, Capital One has all of your bases covered. It offers great options for growth with its youth savings accounts, especially with no minimum balance or fees. Plus, the mobile app has parental controls so you can help your kids make and achieve their savings goals. The Fed\u00a0cut rates by a quarter-point at its Nov. 7 meeting, its second rate cut in two meetings. Coupled with September's half-point cut, the federal funds rate has been reduced by a cumulative 0.75 percentage points to a range of 4.50%\u20134.75%. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means savings account rates will decline after reaching heights not seen in more than 20 years. Kids or youth savings accounts are bank or credit union deposit accounts that are available only to customers younger than 21\u2014though they're sometimes capped at age 12 or 18. They provide a way for young savers to deposit funds and earn some interest, but also serve as a way for kids and teens to get familiar with how banking works. By establishing a relationship with a financial institution, learning how to handle things like online banking, and seeing the interest they've earned at the end of each month, a first bank account provides practical training for a child. The best kid and teen savings accounts actually pay higher interest rates than adult accounts as a way to incentivize young savers. However, the balances on which those higher interest rates apply often are capped. What the savings account earns may also be changed based on your child's age. For instance, the account may pay a high rate to younger savers, but once they turn 18, their account may be converted to an adult account with a lower rate. \"I have two teenagers and both have already had more than one high-yield savings account. When they were young children, I set up USAlliance accounts for each of them, gaining them that special birthday check every year. But once they each became teens, I moved them into savings accounts that have a related teen checking account with a debit card. I consider it an important part of their education here at home to learn how to use a debit card, to build good habits on managing spending vs. saving, and to become familiar with online and mobile banking.\" -Sabrina Karl, Staff Writer for Investopedia For individuals younger than 18, banks and credit unions most commonly offer some kind of savings account. But the account types they offer can vary, such as: If the child for whom you are opening the account is a minor, you or another adult will need to put your name on the account as well. That makes it a joint account, since those under 18 are prohibited from holding bank accounts on their own. Besides a parent, other common adults to use for a joint account with a child are a grandparent, an aunt or uncle, an adult sibling, or a guardian. Whether or not your child needs to pay taxes on their savings account earnings depends on how much unearned income they\u2019ve received during the year. Unearned income includes earnings such as bank interest and investment income, and any amount less than $2,500 is exempt from the regular income tax in 2023 under the \"Tax On A Child's Investment And Other Unearned Income\u201d rule, more commonly known as the Kiddie Tax. Knowing how to manage one's money is an important life skill\u2014and opening a savings account for a kid or a teen is a great way of teaching your child money skills by letting them dip their toe in the world of personal banking. It's also ideal for them to have this experience while they're still a minor and you're connected to the same account as a joint owner. That way you can help them manage the account and teach them money management and banking skills along the way. Although the Federal Reserve lifted its limit on savings account withdrawals, some banks still limit customers to six withdrawals per month. If your child makes more withdrawals than that, there may be excess withdrawal fees. Choosing the best account for your child or teen comes down to shopping around to familiarize yourself with the various options and then choosing the financial institution and account that best meets your most important needs. Here are some things to consider: In the end, choosing a kids bank account is similar to choosing one for yourself. First you'll need to decide what features are most valuable to you, and then find the account that checks the most of those priority boxes. Most banks and credit unions, including those recommended above, allow online account opening, making it easy to start the process at home and on your schedule. It will include the following stesp: There may be times when your child needs access to bank accounts and services other than savings accounts. Depending on their needs, and perhaps any financial goals you have for them, one of the following alternatives may be a better fit. When choosing a bank account for your child, make sure the bank is backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) so that your child's deposits are protected in the unlikely scenario that the institution fails. Every day, Investopedia researches, rates, and reviews hundreds of financial products and services, covering the personal finance categories of bank accounts, savings vehicles, credit cards, insurance, brokerages, robo-advisors, loans, and retirement accounts. When reviewing bank accounts for kids and teens, we look at factors that will help readers choose the best account for their child and their family. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best kids bank accounts since 2021. Capital One offers the best overall savings account for kids, paying interest on any balance amount. There are no monthly or account maintenance fees, and there's no minimum balance required to open a new account. And Capital One allows kids to set up multiple accounts, so they can create an account for each of their savings goals. Once the child turns 18, the account is automatically converted to a Capital One 360 Savings account. Like the kids' account option, a 360 Savings account has no monthly fees or account minimums. The age that's best for a kids savings account is a personal decision. Some parents like setting up a savings account for their infant or toddler children so they can regularly make contributions to the account or deposit gift money received from others. Other parents will find that the tween years (e.g., 10-12 years old) are a great time to start, as the child is old enough to learn something about banking, and may have some income to deposit, or may be interested in starting to spend some money on their own. The third option is to open an account for your child when they are a teen, at which point they may be eligible to open a checking account with a debit card as a complement to their savings account. One recommendation is to open a teen bank account with your child by the time they are 16 or 17, so that you have at least a year to help them learn how to bank before they are free to open accounts on their own at age 18. The answer is in the semantics. Yes, you can open a savings account that pays a high yield. The key is that it needs to be an account that's open to minors as applicants. In contrast, most savings accounts\u2014including all of the options in our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts\u2014are open only to applicants age 18 and older. Fortunately, you can find kid-friendly accounts that pay as much as\u2014or possibly even more than\u2014the best high-yield savings accounts. Each bank or credit union will have its own account opening process. But in general, you (or another adult serving as a co-account holder) will need to provide all the same kind of personal information and identification you would provide if opening an account for yourself. Even if the institution you're dealing with is not an online bank, you'll likely handle the application process online, so be prepared with a photo or scan of either your driver's license or passport. As for documentation for your child, some institutions will ask you to submit a photo or scan of their birth certificate. Or, if your child has a driver's license, a photo or scan of this may be requested. Certificates of deposit (CDs) could be a good option for money your child is holding in savings. CDs generally pay slightly higher interest than a savings account, in exchange for you agreeing to keep the funds in the CD until it matures. Typical CD terms range from 3 months to 5 years, and if you cash the CD in early, you'll face an early withdrawal penalty. While those under 18 are not legally able to open a CD on their own, you can open a CD for them if you do it through a custodial account. Not every financial institution will offer custodial accounts, but for those that do, the account would be in your child's name, and the money would belong to them. But you or another adult must be named as the custodian of the account. Deciding between putting your child's money in a savings account vs. a CD comes down to when they will want to access the money. If you know they will hold some portion of their savings for months or even years without touching it, moving that amount into a custodial CD account could boost their earnings. But for money you think the child will want to access in the near term, a savings account offers the ability to withdraw the funds anytime your child wants.  A 14-year-old can't open a savings account without the help of an adult who is 18 or 21 years or older. Some kid or teen bank accounts are available for teens up to ages 12 or 18. After that, they may need to switch to a regular bank account. Talk to the bank to better understand what you need to open the account for your child or teen. You may actually find some kids' savings accounts offering 7% APY or more, better than you may find on adult high-yield savings accounts. In our list of the best kids' savings accounts above, Spectrum Credit Union has been known to offer 7% APY on its MySavings Youth account. To present our top picks of the best kid and teen savings accounts, we looked at options from the following banks and credit unions: Alliant Credit Union, BECU, Capital One, Chase, Chevron Federal Credit Union, Citizens Bank, First Internet Bank, First Tech Federal Credit Union, Northpointe Bank, Pen Air Federal Credit Union, Teachers Federal Credit Union, and USAlliance Financial. We began our research by first identifying almost two dozen youth savings accounts that are available to consumers nationwide and that pay at least 0.25% APY. From there, we dug into the details to find those that charge no fees, offer the highest interest rates, allow the highest balances, and offer a complimentary checking or spending account. We also considered the age limits of each account, the mobile app features, and any added perks offered by the account, enabling us to distill the list down to these top five contenders.

            "title": "How Is a Savings Account Taxed?",
            "content": "If your savings account earns interest, you'll owe money to the IRS Investopedia / Yurle Villegas Savings accounts are taxed based on the interest that you accrue during the year. Any interest you earn, you must report to the IRS, which determines how much you pay in taxes based on your personal income tax bracket. Taxable income includes interest earned on traditional savings accounts, the\u00a0best high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs), certificates of deposits (CDs), and money market deposit accounts. Savings accounts are not generally thought of as investments. However, they do earn money in the form of interest. The IRS considers the interest earned taxable income, whether you keep the money in the account, transfer it to another account, or withdraw it. When the bank pays interest into your account during the tax year, you will owe taxes on it. Interest from a savings account is taxed at your earned income tax rate for the year. For the 2024 and 2025 tax years, those rates ranged from 10% to 37%. Your financial institution will send you tax form 1099-INT early in the year so that you can report any interest earned on the account if the earnings are more than $10. But whether or not you receive a 1099-INT, you must report all interest income, even if it's just a few dollars. If your net investment income (NII) or modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is over a certain threshold, interest income is also subject to another tax called the net investment income tax. If you received a cash bonus for signing up for your savings account, you'll owe income tax on that amount. Your bank will report it on your 1099-INT form. The earned interest on savings accounts is taxed, but you do not have to pay taxes on the full balance in your account. The original money that you deposit will have already been taxed. If your savings account has $10,000 and earns 0.2% interest, you are only taxed on the $20 interest the bank pays you. You will not be taxed on the $10,000 principal amount. The kinds of savings accounts that are usually taxed include traditional and high-yield savings accounts, CDs, checking accounts, and money market accounts. Using other types of accounts for your money can help you ease your tax burden with savings accounts. Certain types of accounts, such as traditional and Roth individual retirement accounts (IRAs), allow the interest on savings to accrue tax-deferred. You don't have to report the earnings on a tax-advantaged retirement account as taxable income from year to year. With a traditional IRA or 401(k) account, the taxes are deferred until after you retire. You don't owe taxes on your account or its earnings while accumulating the money. You owe income taxes on both when you withdraw the money. With a Roth IRA, you've already pay income taxes on the deposits the year that you make them. Then, you don't owe taxes on the principal or any earnings as long as you withdraw the money after age 59\u00bd. You do not have to pay interest earned on 529 plans, which are accounts designed to help you pay for education. Each year, your bank will send you a Form 1099-INT, showing interest earned in the previous year. Sometimes, it may come as part of a larger statement from a broker. That is the amount you report as taxable income on the account. Then, you will be taxed according to your income bracket. Interest from a savings account is taxed at your earned income tax rate for the year. It's in addition to your earnings and is taxed as such. For the 2024 and 2025 tax years, those rates range from 10% to 37%. Early each year, the bank that holds your savings account sends you a form 1099-INT, showing interest earned in the previous year. In some cases, it may come as part of a larger statement from a broker. That is the amount you report as taxable income on the account. According to the IRS, you must report all taxable and tax-exempt interest you earned on your federal income tax return, even if the bank didn't send you a form. The IRS can check your savings account but will rarely investigate your financial accounts unless you are being audited. Assume the IRS knows about all your bank accounts and report your earnings on these accounts as income. You can use a tax-advantaged retirement account to help you reduce your tax burden while you build your income. With a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), you will pay taxes on the deposits, but the earnings can grow tax-free. When you make withdrawals from a Roth account, you will not owe taxes. You must pay taxes on interest payments you received in your high-yield savings account or other savings account\u2014even if it didn't add up to much. Taxes can add to inflation's bite on any returns you earn in your savings account. Consider comparing savings account interest rates to find higher-yield accounts to make what you can.

            "url": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sweepaccount.asp",
            "title": "Sweep Accounts Definition: Types and How They Work",
            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. Investopedia / Dennis Madamba A sweep account is a bank or brokerage account that automatically transfers amounts that exceed a certain level into a higher interest-earning investment option at the close of each business day. Commonly, the excess cash is swept into a money market fund. Using a sweep vehicle like a sweep fund works by providing the customer with the greatest amount of interest with the minimum amount of personal intervention by transferring money at the end of the day into a high-interest account. In a sweep program, a bank's computers analyze customer use of checkable deposits and sweep funds into money market deposit accounts. Some brokerage accounts have similar features that enable investors to gain some additional return for unused cash. Sweep accounts are simple mechanisms that allow any money above or below a set threshold in a checking account to be swept into a better investment vehicle. Sweep accounts were needed historically because federal banking regulations prohibited interest on checking accounts. Sweep accounts were originally devised to get around a government regulation that limited banks from offering interest on commercial checking accounts. Sweep accounts, whether for business or personal use, provide a way to ensure money is not sitting idly in a low-interest account when it could be earning higher interest rates in better liquid cash investment vehicles. These investment vehicles that provide higher interest rates while still offering liquidity include money market mutual funds, high-interest investment or savings accounts, and even short-term certificates with 30-, 60- or 90-day maturities for known layovers in investments. Businesses and individuals need to keep an eye on the costs of sweep accounts, as the benefit from higher returns from investment vehicles outside the checking account can be offset by the fees charged for the account. Many brokerages or banking institutions charge flat fees, while others charge a percentage of the yield. Sweep accounts may not be free, and broker fees may make the account less attractive on a net basis. Sweep accounts for individual investors are typically used by brokerages to park money waiting to be reinvested such as dividends, incoming cash deposits, and money from sell orders. These funds are typically swept into high-interest holding accounts or money market funds until an investor decides on future investments or until the broker can execute already standing orders within the portfolio. Sweep accounts are a typical business tool, especially for small businesses that rely on daily cash flow but want to maximize earning potential on sitting cash reserves. A business sets a minimum balance for its main checking account, over which any funds are swept into a higher-interest investment product. The business might also use a credit sweep to move the excess funds over to pay down pending lines of credit. If the balance ever dips below the threshold, the funds are swept back into the checking account from the investment account. Depending on the institution and investment vehicle, the sweep process is generally set daily from the checking account, while the return of funds can experience delays. With the changes in regulations on checking accounts, some banking institutions also offer high-interest rates on amounts over certain balances. A sweep account is a type of bank or brokerage account that is linked to an investment account and automatically transfers funds when the balance is above or below a preset minimum. Typically, this is used to sweep excess cash into a money market fund, where it will earn more interest than an ordinary bank account. Sweep accounts can also work the other way around, moving funds from an investment account to a checking account when the owner's balance falls below a set threshold. Individual sweeps are typically used by brokerages to store client funds until the owner decides how to invest the money. For example, a sweep account might move excess cash to a money market fund, where it will earn greater returns than an ordinary checking account. Business sweep accounts are often used by small companies with large cash flows. They allow the company to earn interest on excess cash reserves while ensuring that they have enough cash on hand to pay for business expenses. Sweep accounts, whether for business or personal use, are an easy way to ensure that money is earning a return rather than sitting in a low-interest bank account.\u00a0Some institutions offer an auto-sweep feature whereby the sweep account is linked to the non-sweep account and the transfers are initiated automatically when the defined thresholds (upper and lower) are crossed. Sweep accounts are bank/brokerage accounts that move excess money between a client's cash account and an investment account. When the monetary level in the cash account exceeds the required amount, the excess is moved into the higher interest-bearing investment account automatically. This allows the client account to earn interest on money that isn't being used.

            "title": "The 5 Best Alternatives to Bank Savings Accounts",
            "content": "J.B. Maverick is an active trader, commodity futures broker, and stock market analyst 17+ years of experience, in addition to 10+ years of experience as a finance writer and book editor. Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications. With traditional bank savings accounts paying a modest amount of interest, more individuals are looking for better-paying alternatives. Among them are money market accounts, other bank-account options, and peer-to-peer lending. Here's what you need to know about the best alternatives to bank savings accounts. Investopedia / Ellen Lindner One simple alternative to depositing money in a traditional bank savings account is a money market account. Money market accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) just like regular savings or checking accounts. In addition to paying higher interest rates than standard savings accounts, money market accounts offer limited checking account services. There is usually a relatively low maximum number of checks that you can write on your account per month\u2014typically between five and 10. In return for abiding by this restricted withdrawal activity, money market account holders receive a higher interest rate than those that are available for traditional savings accounts. A bank offering only a 0.10% interest rate on standard savings accounts, for example, might offer a 0.25% interest rate on a money market account. Money market accounts usually have other restrictions as well, such as a required minimum opening deposit amount or a minimum balance requirement. If there is a minimum balance requirement and the account drops below the minimum, account holders may be paid the lower standard interest rate offered on regular savings accounts. Some banks also charge a penalty fee. Before opening a money market or other alternative account, scrutinize the fine print of your agreement for any restrictions that apply to the account, along with all fees that the account may incur. If you don't need access to your funds for at least a year or two, you can consider certificates of deposit (CDs). Generally, the longer you are willing to have your money tied up, the higher the interest rate you can get. One-year and two-year CDs typically offer higher interest rates than rates on traditional bank savings accounts. But your money will be locked up for the term of the CD\u2014typically a few months to a few years. If you withdraw it before that, you may be subject to fees and penalties. With a little planning, you can use a CD ladder strategy to spread your across CDs of varying term lengths to provide more liquidity. Since the terms of CDs\u2014including interest rates and early withdrawal penalties\u2014vary significantly between institutions, shop around for a CD to maximize your return. You can often get a higher interest rate simply by moving a savings account from a traditional bank to a credit union or online bank. Credit unions operate much the same as banks, although they typically offer fewer financial services. Credit unions commonly offer significantly better interest rates on savings accounts than banks do because credit unions are not-for-profit organizations. Credit union accounts are federally insured through the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). Online banks, such as Ally Bank or American Express Bank, also typically offer higher interest rates on savings accounts. They generally have lower overhead expenses thank banks that have physical branches, so they can pass their savings on to customers. Moreover, these banks typically offer more attractive rates on CDs than brick-and-mortar banks. High-yield checking accounts also tend to offer better interest rates than savings accounts. Some of these checking accounts offered more than 6% annual percentage yield in May 2024. To get the higher interest rates, you typically have to meet certain requirements, such as having a minimum balance, establishing direct deposit or bill pay, or conducting a minimum number of monthly debit card transactions. If you fail to meet the requirements for receiving the higher rates, there's usually no penalty. You are often simply provided the bank's standard lower rate for checking accounts. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending services, usually operated through websites, have become increasingly popular in recent years. P2P lending provides a way to borrow money and can provide returns of about 5% to 10% for individual lender investors who fund the loans. Through websites such as Prosper.com, individuals on the lending side provide loan capital for individuals on the borrowing side. Lending accounts with even the best P2P lenders are not FDIC-insured like bank savings accounts and you could lose money. Borrowers are screened by the service and typically must meet certain requirements to get loans. However, the risk on any individual loan is spread across a large number of lender investors. Individual lenders usually fund no more than $25 to $50 of any one loan. An individual seeking a loan of $2,000 for home improvements, for example, may have the loan funded by 40 different individual lenders, each providing $50 toward the loan total. The lending service evaluates borrowers and the purpose of the loan to determine credit risk and the interest rate to be charged for a loan. Individual lender investors can select their level of risk to determine which kinds of loans their money will be used to fund. One of the advantages of putting money into a peer-to-peer lending account is that you can open a lending account with a very low minimum deposit, as little as $25,\u00a0and can choose to add money to the account monthly just as one does with a savings account. Keep in mind that\u00a0the regulatory environment around P2P lending is complicated and can differ from state to state. Due diligence before investing\u2014and careful examination of how payment to you as a lender is organized\u2014is critical. Some options, like peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, are not insured by the FDIC, so you could lose some or all of your money. Other options, like high-yield checking accounts, require you to follow rules like minimum account balances and limited withdrawals. Although setting up a savings account at your bank is safe and convenient, there are some downsides. Individuals who store money in a savings account miss out on larger interest payments that a high-yield savings account or certificate of deposit (CD) could provide. You won't earn as much interest keeping your money in a savings account, but there are some benefits. Your money will be fully insured through an FDIC member bank and you won't face penalties for early withdrawals or going below a minimum balance.

            "title": "Term Deposit vs. Demand Deposit: What's the Difference?",
            "content": "Term deposits and demand deposits refer to two different types of deposit accounts available at a bank or similar financial institution, such as a credit union. Demand deposits and term deposits differ in terms of accessibility or liquidity, and in the amount of interest that can be earned on the deposited funds. bojanstory / Getty Images Term deposits, also known as time deposits, are investment deposits made for a predetermined period, ranging from a few months to several years. The depositor receives a predetermined rate of interest on the term deposit over the specified period. Funds deposited for longer periods command a higher interest rate. Term deposit accounts pay a higher rate of interest than traditional savings accounts. Funds cannot be withdrawn from a term deposit account until the end of the chosen period without incurring a financial penalty, and withdrawals often require written notice in advance. At the end of the period, the depositor has the choice of withdrawing deposited funds plus earned interest, or rolling over the funds into a new term deposit. The most common form of a term deposit is a bank certificate of deposit or CD. Demand deposit accounts offer greater liquidity and ease of access as compared to term deposits but pay lower interest rates, and they may also include various fees for handling the account. Depositors can withdraw any or all of the funds in a demand deposit account at any time without penalty or prior notice required, although some banks charge a small fee if you exceed their limit of monthly withdrawals. Funds a depositor may need to access at any time should be kept in a demand deposit account. Examples of demand deposit accounts include regular checking accounts, savings accounts, or money market accounts. Demand deposits and term deposits differ in terms of accessibility or liquidity, and in the amount of interest that can be earned on the deposited funds There are several key differences between term deposits and demand deposits. Some of the more prominent differences are below. Investopedia / Sabrina Jiang Money market accounts\u00a0have low fees and generally offer higher returns than savings accounts, however, the fluctuation of interest rates means no fixed amount of interest is earned on the account. Checking accounts typically have higher fees and do not pay any interest to the holder, although some checking accounts earn a slight amount of interest. These accounts are favorable for individuals doing a lot of business or those who frequently need to access funds immediately for the purchasing of goods or services. Savings accounts are demand deposit accounts that typically have no fees attached. Interest rates on savings accounts are fixed and lower than interest rates available on time deposits. Both checking and savings accounts are accessible by the account holder through various banking options,\u00a0such as teller service, online banking, and ATMs. The Federal Reserve\u2019s Consumer Compliance Handbook lists the basic characteristics of demand deposit accounts: no limitations on transfers or withdrawals made by the account holder; no maturity period, or an original maturity of six days or less; funds are paid on demand; the account may not bear interest; and there are no eligibility requirements. The interest rate on available term deposit and demand deposit account change frequently; be prepared to monitor markets when attempting to achieve the best rate. Term deposits and demand deposits are two types of deposits that impact a financial institution's stability, liquidity, profitability, and customer relationships. Term deposits provide a stable source of funding, allowing financial institutions to plan and allocate resources accordingly. For example, an institution knows how much capital is being locked up for a certain period of time, so they may more aggressively loan out those funds in the interim and hold less bank reserves. Term deposits are also a way to attract and retain customers. Financial institutions will often provide an incentive period to attract a customer; for example, a certificate of deposit may have a higher-than-market rate for a given term. By luring the customer in with the rate, the institution often hopes they may be able to retain that customer easier at the end of the term deposit. On the other hand, financial institutions relate demand deposits with everyday banking transactions. Banks lean on demand deposits to providing various services, helping build customer relationships that may springboard into other services such as creating loans. Though these deposits also play a crucial role in lending activities, there is more risk and uncertainty around the liquidity and lock-up period for the bank. Yes, demand deposits are typically insured by the government through programs like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in the United States. This insurance provides protection to depositors in case of bank failures, up to a certain amount per depositor per institution. Generally, you cannot withdraw money from a term deposit before it matures without penalties. Early withdrawal may result in the loss of interest earnings, reduced principal amount, or paying a predetermined penalty fee, which varies depending on the terms and conditions of the deposit. Several factors influence the interest rate on a term deposit, including market conditions, economic indicators, central bank policies, and the duration of the deposit. Financial institutions determine the rates based on these factors to attract deposits and manage their liquidity needs. Generally, you cannot add more money to a term deposit account once it is opened. The deposit amount and term are predetermined at the time of account opening. However, you can open additional term deposits or renew existing ones with additional funds. Yes, it is possible to have multiple term deposits at the same time. Opening multiple term deposits allows you to diversify your savings, stagger maturity dates, and take advantage of varying interest rates. Each term deposit will have its own duration, interest rate, and terms. Demand deposits are transactional accounts designed for everyday banking needs, offering immediate access to funds through methods like checks, debit cards, and online transfers. On the other hand, term deposits are savings accounts with fixed durations and higher interest rates. They require depositors to lock in their funds for a specific period, limiting access until maturity. Term deposits are suited for individuals seeking secure returns over a fixed timeframe, while demand deposits prioritize liquidity and convenience for frequent transactions.

            "content": "While it may seem like it takes only minutes for an American citizen to open an account, it can take non-U.S. citizens a lot longer due to more paperwork. You'll have to meet more requirements if you want to start saving (and spending) dollars in the U.S. Here's what it means if you're a new to the U.S. and you want to open a bank account. A U.S.-based bank account can help you pay bills, get a U.S.-based ATM and debit card, receive funds via direct deposit, and more easily transfer money using apps like Venmo, which only works for people physically located in the U.S. with a U.S. phone number. While you can open an account, the rules are different for non-citizens due to federal regulations. According to the U.S. government, foreign individuals wishing to open U.S. bank accounts can be divided into resident and non-resident aliens. A non-resident alien is someone who: According to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), non-resident alien banking system deposits in the U.S. range from hundreds of billions of dollars to about $1 trillion. But banks and credit unions must follow stricter guidelines when verifying the identity of a non-American account applicant, whether you're an international student, business owner, or H1-B visa holder. If you're a legal permanent resident, though, it will probably take you the same amount of time to open your account as a citizen. The laws governing bank accounts for foreigners are federal, but their application is local. Banks and credit unions have different document requirements and processes for non-American citizens who open accounts. Check in advance about what's required before you begin the process, especially since you'll almost certainly be applying in person at a brick-and-mortar location. The bank or credit union is required to gather proof of the following from you: Validating documents provide the proof necessary, as explained further below. You'll have to bring originals because photocopies are not accepted. In addition, many banks and credit unions may require a minimum deposit to open an account. Applicants for a bank account need to show photo identification. This must be an unexpired government-issued identification that shows your nationality or residence. The identification must have a photograph. For U.S. citizens, this could be a driver's license or passport. For non-U.S. citizens, options could include: You should bring proof of your current U.S. address, such as a utility bill with your name and address or a letter addressed to you. If you're a student or employed, you might bring documents regarding your workplace. For example, some credit unions only allow you to join if you live or work in the credit union's service area. You can open an account that does not pay any interest if you don't yet have a Social Security number (SSN) or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). But you must pay U.S. taxes on any earnings if you want to earn interest. Certain resident and\u00a0nonresident aliens\u00a0unable to obtain Social Security numbers may file IRS form W-7 to get an ITIN. Some banks may also require you to bring your home country's tax ID or federal ID number to open an account. Most nonresident aliens need to walk into a bank branch in order to open an account. Even if you're able to begin opening your account online, you'll probably be required to appear in person to complete your application. Heightened post-2001 security led to the near-elimination of online applications for foreign accounts, due to the fear of terrorism-related money laundering. That makes it difficult to apply to many online-only banks. Minimum deposits vary by institution but are usually modest. Some initial bank deposits range between $5 and $50, while others have higher requirements. It all depends on where you bank. Some newcomers may face additional challenges depending on their nationality, immigration status, income source, or the financial services they want to perform. You may go through other requirements, or your account may be flagged as higher risk due to the following: Some nations and their citizens are subject to special Office of Foreign Assets Control requirements. For example, certain Cuban nationals in the U.S. with a non-immigrant status might be able to open a bank account. But the Cuban national could only use the account while in the U.S. The person could not access the U.S. account to make and receive certain payments if visiting or residing in Cuba. This rule helps the U.S. bank observe sanctions against Cuba. As another example, an international student might need to bring proof of identification and U.S. immigration status, a university identification card, letter of enrollment, and government identification documents. Even with these documents, you may find that only larger or university-affiliated institutions will accept your account application. Opening a bank account without a Social Security number (SSN) or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) may be possible. However, if you get a bank account that pays interest (such as a high-yield savings account or interest-earning checking account), you will need an ITIN. Any interest you earn is subject to U.S. taxes\u2014even if it's just $10. Due to federal regulations and internal bank policies, you may find it difficult to open an account with an online bank if you're a non-resident alien. The online bank may only open accounts for citizens or legal permanent residents in the United States with proof of a U.S. street address. It may be possible to open a U.S. bank account, but much depends on the bank's policies and any background checks. A bank might require you to have a U.S. physical address to open an account. Be sure to call or ask in advance, then visit the bank branch in person. Bring any required documentation such as a tourist visa, a type of nonimmigrant\u00a0visa\u00a0for people who wish to temporarily enter the\u00a0U.S\u2014usually for business, medical reasons, or vacation.\u00a0You may find it easier to open a U.S. bank account with a multinational financial institution. Investopedia / Yurle Villegas Opening a bank account as a foreign national involves more effort, and perhaps more stress, especially for those who lack resident-alien status. If you're still living in your home country, consider seeking out a U.S-based multinational bank that has branches where you live and opening an account with them before you leave. Such a move at a foreign branch bank provides international applicants with the opportunity to build up a business relationship with the institution that should simplify applying for a U.S. account at one of its branches in the U.S. Venmo. \"Requirements.\" FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering InfoBase. \"Risks Associated With Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing: Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Individuals\u2014Overview.\" Help with My Bank.gov. \"I Want to Open a New Account.

            "title": "Annual Equivalent Rate (AER): Definition, Formula, Examples",
            "content": "Investopedia / Jake Shi The annual equivalent rate (AER) is the interest rate for a savings account or investment product that has more than one compounding period. AER is calculated under the assumption that any interest paid is included in the principal payment's balance and the next interest payment will be based on the slightly higher account balance. The AER method means that interest can be compounded several times in a year, depending on the number of times that interest payments are made. AER is also known as the effective annual interest rate or the annual percentage yield (APY). The AER is the actual interest rate that an investor will earn for an investment, a loan, or another product, based on compounding. The AER reveals to investors what they can expect to return from an investment (the ROI)\u2014the actual return of the investment based on compounding, which is more than the stated, or nominal, interest rate. Assuming that interest is calculated\u2014or compounded\u2014more than once a year,\u00a0the AER will be higher than the stated interest rate. The more compounding periods, the greater the difference between the two will be. Investors can compare the AER for different banking products to find the best savings accounts or other investment vehicles. \ufeff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual\u00a0equivalent\u00a0rate\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n=\n\n\nThe\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0compounding\u00a0periods\u00a0(times\u00a0per\u00a0year\u00a0interest\u00a0is\u00a0paid)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\n=\n\n\nThe\u00a0stated\u00a0interest\u00a0rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Annual equivalent rate}=\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^n-1\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &n=\\text{The number of compounding periods (times per year interest is paid)}\\\\ &r = \\text{The stated interest rate}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\n\n\n\u200bAnnual\u00a0equivalent\u00a0rate=(1+nr\u200b)n\u22121where:n=The\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0compounding\u00a0periods\u00a0(times\u00a0per\u00a0year\u00a0interest\u00a0is\u00a0paid)r=The\u00a0stated\u00a0interest\u00a0rate\u200b\ufeff To calculate AER: The AER is displayed as a percentage (%). Let's look at AER in both savings accounts and bonds. Assume an investor wishes to sell all the securities in their investment portfolio and place all the proceeds in a savings account. The investor is deciding between placing the proceeds in Bank A, Bank B, or Bank C, depending on the highest rate offered. Bank A has a quoted interest rate of 3.7% that pays interest on an annual basis. Bank B has a quoted interest rate of 3.65% that pays interest quarterly, and Bank C has a quoted interest rate of 3.7% that pays interest semi-annually. The stated interest rate paid on an account offering monthly interest may be lower than the rate on an account offering only one interest payment per year. However, when interest is compounded, the former account may offer higher returns than the latter account. For example, an account offering a rate of 6.25% paid annually may look more attractive than an account paying 6.12% with monthly interest payments. However, the AER on the monthly account is 6.30%, as opposed to an AER of 6.25% on the account with annual interest payments. Therefore, Bank A would have an annual equivalent rate of 3.7%, or (1 + (0.037 / 1))1 - 1. Bank B has an AER of 3.65% = (1 + (0.0365 / 4))4 - 1, which is equivalent to that of Bank A even though Bank B is compounded quarterly. It would thus make no difference to the investor if they placed their cash in Bank A or Bank B. On the other hand, Bank C has the same interest rate as Bank A, but Bank C pays interest semi-annually. Consequently, Bank C has an AER of 3.73%, which is more attractive than the other two banks' AER. The calculation is (1 + (0.037 / 2))2 - 1 = 3.73%. Let's now consider a bond issued by General Electric. In March 2019, General Electric offered a noncallable semiannual coupon with a 4% coupon rate expiring Dec. 15, 2023. The nominal, or stated rate, of the bond, is 8%\u2014or the 4% coupon rate times two annual coupons. However, the annual equivalent rate is higher, given the fact that interest is paid twice a year. The AER of the bond is calculated as (1+ (0.08 / 2 ))2 - 1 = 8.16%. While the stated interest rate doesn't account for compounding, the AER does. The stated rate will generally be lower than AER if there's more than one compounding period. AER is used to determine which banks offer better rates and which investments might be attractive. The primary advantage of AER is that it is the real rate of interest because it accounts for the effects of compounding. In addition, it is an important tool for investors because it helps them evaluate bonds, loans, or accounts to understand their real return on investment (ROI). Unfortunately, when investors are evaluating different investment options, the AER is usually not stated. Investors must do the work of calculating the figure themselves. It's also important to keep in mind that AER doesn't include any fees that might be tied to purchasing or selling the investment. Also, compounding itself has limitations, with the maximum possible rate being continuous compounding. Unlike the APR, AER reveals the actual interest rate. Crucial in finding the true\u00a0ROI\u00a0from interest-bearing assets. Investors must do the work of calculating AER themselves. AER doesn't take into account fees that may be incurred from the investment. Compounding has limitations, with the maximum possible rate being continuous compounding. AER is one of the various ways to calculate interest on interest, which is called compounding. Compounding refers to earning or paying\u00a0interest\u00a0on previous interest, which is added to the\u00a0principal\u00a0sum of a deposit or loan. Compounding allows investors to boost their returns because they can accrue additional profit based on the interest they've already earned. One of Warren Buffett's famous quotes is, \"My wealth has come from a combination of living in America, some lucky genes, and compound interest.\" Albert Einstein reportedly referred to\u00a0compound interest\u00a0as mankind's greatest invention. When you are borrowing money (in the form of loans), you want to minimize the effects of compounding. On the other hand, all\u00a0investors\u00a0want to maximize compounding on their investments. Many financial institutions\u00a0will quote\u00a0interest rates\u00a0that use compounding principles to their advantage.\u00a0As a consumer, it is important to understand AER so you can determine the interest rate you are really getting. There are many websites that offer tools for calculating AER, including the websites Calculator Soup, Get Calc, and Omni Calculator. The nominal\u00a0interest rate is the advertised or stated interest rate on a loan, without taking into account any fees or compounding of interest. The nominal interest rate is what is specified in the loan contract, without adjusting for compounding. Once the compounding adjustment has been made, this is the effective interest rate. A real interest rate is an interest rate that has been adjusted to remove the effects of inflation. Real interest rates reflect the real\u00a0cost of funds, in the case of a loan (and a borrower) and the real yield (or ROI) for an investor. The real interest rate of an investment is calculated as the difference between the\u00a0nominal interest rate\u00a0and the inflation rate. The annual equivalent rate, or AER, is the actual interest rate on a loan when you account for how interest is compounded. This rate is higher than the nominal interest rate for a loan if interest is compounded more than once a year. Because this is a more accurate representation of the returns of a loan than the nominal rate, the AER is also known as the effective annual interest rate.

            "title": "Current Account Savings Account (CASA): Definition and Formula",
            "content": "Investopedia / Julie Bang A current account savings account (CASA), offered by some banks, combines the functions of a checking account and a savings account. The customer gets little or no interest on the current account money that is used routinely to pay bills but is paid interest on the savings portion. Although it is available globally, CASA is most commonly used in Western Asia and Southeast Asia, A CASA is a non-term deposit, meaning it is used for the everyday banking and savings needs of the consumer and does not have a specific maturity or expiration date. It is valid for as long as the account holder wants it to remain open. This is in contrast to a term deposit, such as a certificate of deposit (CD), which commits the customer's money for a certain period of time. On the maturity date, the bank or institution returns the money with the agreed interest payment. A CASA works like a checking account. The money deposited can be withdrawn or paid out at any time. The interest on the savings portion, meanwhile, acts as an incentive to keep some money on deposit and add to it over time. Most banks offer CASAs to their customers for free or for a small fee, depending on minimum or average balance requirements. A CASA\u00a0tends to be a cheaper way for a bank to raise money than issuing term deposits, such as certificates of deposit (CDs), which offer higher interest rates to the customers. Because the interest paid on the CASA deposit\u00a0is lower than on a term deposit, the bank\u2019s net interest income (NII) is higher. Thus, CASAs are\u00a0a cheaper source of funding for banks. Their main drawback is uncertainty. In the case of on-demand deposits, a bank can't be sure how much money it will actually have available to lend. The CASA is designed to encourage regular saving by making it easier and keeping it flexible. By using a CASA, customers forego a higher rate of interest in return for better liquidity. They're not tying up their money for a period of months. Consumers and small businesses also get to build a working relationship over time with a bank. As noted above, the current account portion of the CASA pays little or no interest. There are generally no limits on deposits or withdrawals. The savings account portion typically has restrictions on the number of withdrawals a person can make. These vary by bank. In regions where CASA accounts are common, the percentage of total bank deposits that are in a CASA is an important metric to determine the bank's liquidity. The CASA ratio indicates how much of a bank\u2019s total deposits are in both current and savings accounts. A higher CASA ratio indicates that a bank has a higher proportion of stable deposits available for lending, according to Navi, a financial services firm based in India. The ratio can be calculated using the following formula: CASA Ratio = CASA Deposits \u00f7 Total Deposits A portion of a CASA account is a savings account, and the customer receives interest on the deposit. The interest will be slightly lower than it might be for a regular savings account. By combining checking and savings functions in one account, the CASA is designed to make it easier for the customer to save week after week. A savings account does that, too. However, the consumer is more likely to leave a savings account untouched. CASA savings are slightly easier to access. That difference means that the bank can't rely as much on the CASA deposits staying intact from week to week. They are a bit less stable for the bank's lending purposes, and thus earn less interest. A portion of the CASA, the \"current account\" portion, is a checking account. It works like any checking account. The customer can withdraw cash and write checks against the balance. The bank will issue a debit card for the account, and the customer will be able to use its online banking portal. This portion of the CASA earns no interest. Interest rates vary from one bank to the next but a CASA account will usually pay a lower interest rate than any other offering at the same bank. The difference is the time commitment. A CASA essentially has no time commitment. The customer can use that money anytime. In order to get a better interest rate, you have to promise to keep that money in the bank for a certain period of time. The longer the time commitment, the higher the interest rate. CASA accounts are offered to consumers are small businesses as a way to maintain maximum flexibility while still earning a little bit of interest on the money they save. They are essentially a combination of a checking account and a savings account. In terms of function, they aren't much different from separate but linked checking and savings accounts that are common in the U.S. They are designed to encourage consumers to save a bit of their income from week to week, and to provide the bank with a steady stream of money to reinvest at higher rates of return.

            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Hirurg / Getty Images The term transaction deposit refers to a deposit made to a transaction account, such as a checking account. Transaction deposits are liquid, which means the account holder can access the funds right away without any delays, waiting periods, or penalties. As such, a transaction deposit can be used for other transactions at the request of the account holder. Banks may put restrictions on how and when certain deposits can be used, such as large deposits that are put on hold. Transaction deposits work differently than non-transaction deposits, which are made into accounts that mature after a period of time. As noted above, transaction deposits are any deposits that are made to transaction accounts. Also called demand deposits, they are liquid, which makes them easily accessible by the account holder. This means that if a consumer needs access to their money, they don't need to provide the bank or account provider with any advanced notice. Deposits can be made in bank branches, at automated teller machines (ATMs), and by transferring funds from another account. Direct deposits also qualify as transaction deposits. Individuals who wish to access their transaction deposits can do so in one of several ways, including: Given how liquid they are, transaction deposits allow individuals to meet their day-to-day banking needs whenever they wish. There are generally no limitations on these deposits unless otherwise indicated in the account agreement or its terms and conditions. In order to be considered a transaction account, an account must allow unrestricted transfers and withdrawals, deposits must not have a maturity date, and allow debit transactions on demand within a seven-day period. There must also be no eligibility requirements for this type of account. Some banks may place certain restrictions on transaction deposits and accounts. A bank may put a partial or full hold on large or unusual deposits for a certain period of time. This may be the case for a customer who deposits a large check to their account that needs to be verified before the funds are released. They may also do this for new accounts that don't have an established history. Once the hold period is up, though, the funds are fully accessible. Savings accounts that allow account holders with unlimited access are also considered transaction accounts. Transaction deposits are the opposite of non-transaction deposits. These are deposits that are made to non-transaction accounts, such as savings accounts, money market accounts (MMAs), and certificates of deposit (CDs). These accounts generate interest, giving the account holder a return on their investment. The difference between these two types of deposits is the ease and speed at which funds can be accessed from the account. Unlike transaction deposits, non-transaction deposits are not nearly as liquid because account holders are either limited or restricted from accessing all or part of the funds in the account. Or they must make a request for a withdrawal. For instance, CDs require investors to lock up their money for a specified period of time, from several months to several years. Early withdrawals may be permitted, but the account holder may forfeit any interest and may have a fee deducted from their principal balance. Similarly, some banks may limit the number of debit transactions from savings or MMAs every month. If they go over that limit, the bank may charge them a withdrawal fee. The Federal Reserve's Regulation D restricted withdrawals from MMAs and savings accounts to six per month. Individuals who went over this limit were charged a service fee while banks were able to revoke and convert these vehicles to regular accounts for people who consistently went over the six withdrawal limit. This was put in place to help financial institutions meet their reserve requirements. The Fed lifted these restrictions in April 2020, giving banks the authority to decide how to manage customer withdrawals from these accounts. Non-transaction deposits may also be referred to as time deposits or term deposits. Funds in a checking account are examples of transaction deposits because they can be used for daily expenses or may be withdrawn from an account by the holder of the account. In contrast, time-based deposits, such as a CD, are examples of non-transaction deposits because they cannot be transferred or withdrawn at a moment's notice. According to the Federal Reserve, transaction or demand deposit accounts must allow for unrestricted withdrawals and transfers on demand within a seven-day period, they must not have a maturity period, and there must be no eligibility requirements. Transaction deposits are made to transaction accounts, such as checking accounts. Individuals have easy access to these funds on demand without restriction. Non-transaction accounts, on the other hand, may come with limitations on how and when the funds can be withdrawn. For instance, a bank may restrict holders of a savings account to a certain number of withdrawals per month. A time deposit is a deposit made to a non-transaction account. This type of account is normally interest-bearing and generally has a maturity date. Withdrawals may be restricted when it comes to these kinds of accounts. Some savings accounts may qualify as non-transaction accounts, as do CDs. Federal Reserve System. \"Regulation D: Reserve Requirements,\" Page 1.

            "title": "Savings Account vs. Roth IRA: What\u2019s the Difference?",
            "content": "Figure out whether a savings account or Roth IRA is right for you Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. JGI / Jamie Grill / Getty Images A savings account is a bank or credit union account that holds cash deposits. A Roth IRA is a tax-advantaged individual retirement account (IRA) meant primarily for long-term retirement investing. Both savings accounts and Roth IRAs can be a source of money in an emergency. Here are the differences between the two. Investopedia / Hilary Allison Savings accounts are an excellent place to keep ready cash, such as your emergency fund or money you\u2019re amassing for short-term goals, like a summer vacation or your next car. They can also be a safe place to park money temporarily\u2014such as the proceeds from a home sale\u2014before you invest it elsewhere. In addition to regular savings accounts, high-yield accounts pay higher interest rates. These accounts are commonly offered by online banks. Savings accounts of either kind are generally insured up to certain limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), depending on the institution at which they are held. Given a long enough time frame, there are other choices. For example, a certificate of deposit (CD) is less liquid than a savings account, but it will often earn you a higher interest rate. The nominal interest you earn on a savings account is considered part of your taxable income. IRAs are intended for retirement and come in several varieties. Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars and can be withdrawn at anytime without penalty. The account\u2019s earnings can also be withdrawn tax-free if you have had a Roth account for at least five years and are 59\u00bd\u00a0or older at the time of the withdrawal. There are also some exceptions to the age 59\u00bd requirement. Similar to traditional IRAs, Roth IRA earnings compound and participants are subject to annual contribution limits and other rules. However, unlike owners of traditional IRAs or 401(k) plans, Roth IRA owners don\u2019t have to take required minimum distributions (RMDs). Instead, they can leave their money in the Roth IRA for as long as they live and leave it to a designated beneficiary. Money deposited into a Roth IRA can be invested in various vehicles. Most financial institutions limit those choices to stocks, mutual funds, bonds, and CDs. However, if you set up a self-directed IRA, you can have a wider selection, including real estate, cryptocurrencies, promissory notes, tax lien certificates, and private placement securities. Life insurance and collectibles are not allowed to be held as investments within an IRA. A savings account is all about having accessible cash, and a Roth IRA offers the most accessibility to your savings of any of the tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Because the money you contribute to it is available at any time and for any reason with no penalties, it can be used as an emergency fund. With traditional IRAs and 401(k) accounts, you\u2019ll pay income taxes and possibly an additional 10% early withdrawal penalty to access even your contributions. Typically, having emergency savings totaling three to six months of income is a good idea in case you ever need money in a hurry. A Roth IRA can be useful for this purpose, as you can withdraw your contributions anytime. However, there are two catches: No. Retirement accounts are set up expressly to help people reach their goals of having enough money in their post-work years. Savings accounts are far simpler and meant for short-term and emergency needs. The biggest advantage of a Roth IRA is that if you follow the rules, you won\u2019t pay taxes when you take distributions. In addition, Roth owners aren\u2019t subject to RMDs at age 73 as owners of traditional IRAs or traditional 401(k) accounts are. Roth funds can be invested in various vehicles, such as stocks, mutual funds, bonds, and CDs. If you set up a self-directed IRA, you can even invest in real estate and cryptocurrencies. Only certain holdings are insured. Cash deposits held within Roth IRAs are insured for up to $250,000 by the FDIC and NCUA. For example, if you have a CD within your IRA it will be covered by deposit insurance. However, insurance does not apply to securities such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and other popular investments often held within Roth IRAs. So most people's Roth IRA holdings would not be protected by this insurance. Both savings accounts and Roth IRAs have their purposes. Savings accounts can be a safe place to keep cash for emergencies and short-term goals. Roth IRAs are for long-term goals, primarily retirement. However, Roth IRAs can also be used for withdrawals in an emergency because your Roth contributions are always accessible without penalty. However, your earnings are not.

            "title": "Money Market Fund vs. MMA vs. Savings Account: What\u2019s the Difference?",
            "content": "Find out which type of account is right for you Money market funds, money market accounts (MMAs), and regular savings accounts offer liquid parking spots for cash, so you can easily access the funds whenever necessary. Many traditional savings accounts offer nominal interest rates, with some exceptions. You may find that money market funds or MMAs offer higher returns. Unlike savings accounts, many money market funds and accounts also let you write checks. Brokerages, investment companies, and financial services firms offer money market funds or mutual funds. The funds pool money from multiple investors and invest in high-quality, short-term securities. While technically investments, money market funds act more like on-demand cash accounts since the money is easily accessible, with better returns than an interest-bearing savings account. Money market funds may have a minimum initial investment requirement, balance requirements, and transaction fees. These funds charge other associated fees you won't find with a bank account, including an expense ratio, which is a percentage-based fee for management expenses. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) does not insure your money in the account, though the funds are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Instead, money market funds are insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC) for up to $500,000, including $250,000 in cash. The dividends earned can be taxable or tax-free, depending on how funds invest. On average, money market funds may not yield as high a return as the stock market, but they offer lower risk and lower volatility than stocks. Remember, though, that just like any other investment, there is no guarantee of returns. Historically, money market funds have been hit by investor panics. The SEC has proposed new rule amendments designed to prevent future crises. Money market fund performance is closely tied to the interest rates set by the Federal Reserve and may not outperform a savings account after considering fees. So do your research before moving your money into a money market fund. While money market accounts (MMAs) sound similar to money market mutual funds (and people often confuse the two), MMAs are more similar to savings accounts. You may think of money market accounts as a savings account with several checking account benefits\u2014such as check writing and debit cards. You can use debits cards for purchases, transfers, and ATM withdrawals. MMAs are on-demand, interest-bearing accounts held at a bank or credit union. Deposits of up to $250,000 are FDIC-insured if at a bank and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)-insured if at a credit union. An account's interest rates can depend on your account's amount. To earn a higher rate, money market accounts could require a higher minimum deposit or daily balance than a regular savings account. On average, MMAs provide higher returns than savings accounts. But the best savings account rates can compete with the best MMA rates. Although the Federal Reserve lifted Regulation D withdrawal restrictions (account holders were only allowed to make up to six monthly withdrawals) in 2020, your bank may still limit your ability to access your account's funds. Ask your financial institution about the rules associated with your money market account. Money market funds and money market accounts sound alike because they generate interest in the same investment\u2014short-term debt instruments making up the \"money market.\" For example, a money market mutual fund or MMA invests in certificates of deposit (CDs), government securities, and commercial paper. Savings accounts don't. Savings accounts are offered to consumers by banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions. These accounts are generally considered safe, convenient places to store money as you save for future purchases. Savings accounts hold money you want to transfer or access at any time. Many people use traditional savings accounts to keep their emergency funds. Savings accounts earn interest, so your money grows over time. On average, savings accounts pay lower interest rates than any other savings vehicle, including money market deposit accounts or mutual funds. But with a bit of research, you can find a higher-yielding savings account that makes sense for your goals and the amount you have already saved. Like money market deposit accounts, savings accounts are FDIC- or NCUA-insured for up to $250,000. Money market funds are insured by the SIPC for up to $500,000, including $250,000 in cash. Money market funds, savings accounts, and money market accounts are considered very low-risk vehicles. But of course, there's the usual tradeoff for safety: the lower the risk, the lower the return potential. You likely won't earn as much money in money market funds, savings accounts, or money market accounts as in other investments with a higher risk or more volatility. You could make more money in risker investments such as individual stocks or ETFs. However, you could also lose more. With money market funds, savings accounts, and money market accounts, returns are variable, as interest rates increase or fall in response to a bank's competitive need for deposits and changes in interest rates. If the Fed attempts to stimulate the economy by lowering the federal funds rate, a ripple effect could reverberate throughout the financial markets. This can soon result in lower interest rates and earnings. If the interest rates on your asset do not keep up with inflation's rate, it can erode the real value of your money. Interest in your money market fund, savings account, or money market account is compounded yearly, monthly, or daily. This compounding can have a substantial impact on its return, especially if you maintain a high balance in your account. Investigating each option's details will help you avoid high fees and account minimums, and get the most return for your low-risk savings type. You may opt for a money market account if you have a substantial amount of money\u2014at least four figures' worth\u2014to deposit and can easily maintain such a minimum account balance for a longer period. You'll generally be rewarded with a slightly better yield (although some high-yield savings accounts may offer better returns). The higher your balance, the greater the interest rate, with most institutions. If you want to write checks on the account or draw from it using a debit card, a money market account also offers these privileges. Since you earn more interest for higher balances, money market accounts can be a good place to keep funds for a fairly long period of time, such as more than a year. A savings account could be a better option if you have a more modest sum (under $1,000) to deposit and don't want to worry about maintaining account minimums or fees. If you're worried that a money market account's check-writing or constant access might prove an ongoing temptation, a savings account could also work well for you. Since you can withdraw money from it as easily and it typically doesn't earn much, a savings account is well-suited to short-term goals\u2014a place to park funds until your holiday or a big purchase. Some of the more competitive savings accounts can offer rates higher than the rates you may find with money market accounts. A money market fund could be best for holding your short-term funds before big expenditures or between investments. If you have large amounts of cash, a less-volatile money market fund can also help diversify your investments beyond one or two banks\u2014particularly if you find recent bank failures unnerving\u2014and more volatile stocks. This savings vehicle could be a good fit if you're a savvier, more confident investor or working with a financial advisor. You'll want to research money market funds that match your risk tolerance, desire for returns, and tax considerations. For example, some money market funds are exempt from federal and California tax, with a low expense ratio. This fund might be good if you're a California-based investor. Other money market funds may be taxable but feature higher interest rates or lower expense ratios. Alternatives to money market funds, money market accounts, and savings accounts include: Both money market accounts and CDs are interest-bearing financial accounts insured for up to $250,000. However, a money market account allows you to access your funds whenever you want them. With a CD, you lock up cash with the bank for a term ranging from a month to 10 years. The CD's interest rate is generally higher than an MMA's interest rate. Since rules and yields for money market accounts vary greatly, shop around for the best money market accounts. When evaluating money market accounts, consider the interest rate along with the following: Deciding whether to place your money in a money market fund, a money market deposit account, or a traditional savings account depends on how much money you have to deposit and how you need to access your cash. Other factors to consider include how much risk you want to assume and whether you want a tax-advantaged savings vehicle. Amid competition between banks and investment firms, you may find that rates vary wildly. A money market fund might have once offered the highest return for your buck. But insured money market and savings accounts may offer competitive rates without the management fees, and with federal insurance for up to $250,000. So, be sure to compare the terms and rates with each. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Updated Investor Bulletin: Focus on Money Market Funds.\" Securities Investor Protection Corp.

            "title": "Medical Savings Account (MSA): Meaning, History, Types",
            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. FatCamera / Getty Images The term medical savings account can refer to any of several tax-benefitted arrangements enacted since the early 1990s. However, it also refers to a specific type of medical savings account (MSA) that was authorized and regulated under the Internal Revenue Code in the early 1990s. This type of account evolved into a health savings account (HSA). Some Medicare Advantage plans offer Medicare MSAs. These accounts are regulated by the administrators of Medicare, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Medical savings accounts (MSAs) were first created by several states in the early 1990s. By 1996, these plans became a federal pilot program within the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\u00a0Medical savings accounts enjoyed tax benefits under the Internal Revenue Code and were models for succeeding medical savings arrangements. The original type of MSA, which could be used by individuals who were either self-employed or members of small group plans and enrolled in high-deductible health plans (HDHPs), was phased out in 2003. However, MSAs structured as Archer MSAs were permitted to continue, although no new Archer MSAs may be created. Participants in high-deductible Medicare Advantage (MA) plans can use Medicare MSAs funded by MA plans that meet guidelines established by Medicare. In 2003, a new tax-benefitted arrangement, a health savings account (HSA), was\u00a0enacted as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. Rules similar to those for MSAs (related to eligibility, HDHP deductibles, contributions, and tax treatment) apply to HSAs. A broader range of individuals can benefit from HSAs than were eligible for the original MSAs; HSAs are available to employed, self-employed, and unemployed individuals. An employee or an employer (or both) can contribute to an HSA. Some employees may be offered other employer-sponsored programs that provide tax-favored healthcare savings. Health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs( are funded solely by the employer. On the other hand, the employee or employer (or both) may contribute to flexible spending arrangements (FSAs). Medical savings accounts were put in place to make the high cost of healthcare services more affordable for Americans. Funding for the first MSAs was contributed by the individual or the employer, but not by both.\u00a0MSAs\u00a0were limited to the self-employed\u00a0or employer groups with 50 or fewer employees, and they were subject to requirements relating to eligibility, contributions, and use of funds. Participants had to be enrolled in a\u00a0high-deductible health insurance\u00a0plan (HDHP).\u00a0Individuals did not pay tax on their own (or their employer's) contributions. MSA distributions were tax-free if used for qualified medical expenses. These arrangements were succeeded by HSAs, which continue to be available.\u00a0HSAs adopted a structure and rules similar to those of MSAs, including the requirement that each account is coupled with an HDHP. Medicare MSAs are available with high-deductible Medicare Advantage (MA) plans (Medicare Part C). The MA plan deposits funds to the insured's MSA, allowing the insured to use the funds to pay for medical care even before the deductible is reached. The\u00a0Medicare MSA\u00a0is similar to an HSA, allowing users to choose their healthcare providers and services. However, although Medicare MSA funds may be used for services not covered by Medicare, only the cost of Medicare services will be counted toward meeting the deductible. For an extra cost, some Medicare MSAs cover extra benefits not covered by the MA Plan\u2014for example, dental care, vision care, hearing aids, and long-term care. However, Medicare MSAs do not cover prescription drugs. Enrollment in Medicare Part D is required for Medicare coverage of prescription drugs. People who are enrolled in a Medicare MSA can use funds from the account to pay for medical expenses even before reaching the high deductible of their insurance plan. Before 2008, self-employed individuals and small businesses with fewer than 50 employees who HDHPs covered were able to create MSAs, known\u00a0as Archer\u00a0MSAs, which were set up as tax-exempt trusts or custodial accounts with U.S. financial institutions. Archer MSAs generally worked in the same way as the original MSAs did. (The original MSAs were discontinued in 2003.) The law authorizing Archer MSAs expired as of Dec. 31, 2007. Because they were discontinued, no new Archer MSAs were created after that year. However, existing accounts were permitted to continue to receive and distribute funds. Individuals\u2019 contributions into Archer MSAs were tax-deductible. Currently, contributions into Archer MSA accounts that have been legacied are tax-deductible (whether or not the contributor itemized deductions). Employer contributions are not taxable to the employee. Only contributions in cash are permitted. Interest or other earnings and distributions to cover the cost of qualified medical expenses are tax-free. At year-end, unused balances can be rolled over to the following year. If insured individuals change jobs, the Archer MSA can move with them to the next employer, and they can make additional deposits provided they continue to be eligible. In 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act authorized the creation of health savings accounts (HSAs) to help pay the medical expenses of individuals enrolled in high-deductible health plans (HDHPs). These accounts became\u00a0a permanent feature of the tax code. IRS Form 1099-SA reports medical savings account distributions. When not used for a qualified medical expense, these distributions are taxable as income. Tax ramifications can also come from making excess contributions into the account. Contributions to HSAs reduce federal taxable income. HSAs\u00a0are available to any eligible individual with an\u00a0HDHP, whether\u00a0self-employed, unemployed, or employed by a small or large company.\u00a0If an employer contributes to an HSA\u2014or an employee contributes through payroll deductions\u2014the amounts are excluded from the employee\u2019s taxable income. Direct contributions by self-employed and unemployed individuals are tax-deductible, whether the individual claims the standard deduction or itemizes.\u00a0Funding can be made anytime between the beginning of the calendar year and before the tax filing deadline for that year. Distributions to pay for qualified medical expenses are tax-free. Sources: Internal Revenue Service. An HSA is a fully vested account; funds are not subject to forfeiture if they remain unspent at the end of the year. The IRS announces annually the HSA contribution limits and the required, inflation-adjusted HDHP amounts for the minimum health plan deductible and the ceiling on out-of-pocket expenses for both self-only and family coverage. Individuals age 55 and older are entitled to an additional contribution amount annually. Individuals enrolled in Medicare cannot contribute to HSAs, but they can make tax-free distributions from any remaining balance in an HSA to pay for qualified medical expenses. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), and Health Reimbursement Accounts (HRAs) are just a few of your MSA options. No, unlike Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), you won't lose the funds in your HSA. Instead, they'll grow over time. No, if you have a high-deductible health plan, you have an HSA. If you have a high-deductible Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C), you have an MSA. Although an MSA is similar to an HSA, it's distinct in that it's only available with high-deductible Medicare Advantage Plans. You do get to choose your healthcare providers (just like with an HSA), but even though your funds can be used to pay for services that Medicare doesn't typically cover, only the Medicare services count toward meeting your plan's deductible.

            "title": "Foreign Savings Account: What it Means, How it Works",
            "content": "A foreign savings account is more like an investment account than traditional savings accounts for most U.S. individuals. Foreign savings accounts allow you to invest your money in a currency other than the dollar. A foreign savings account can be opened when you're in another country or by contacting an overseas bank online if it opens accounts that way. Foreign savings accounts may have higher interest rates than in the U.S., which may make them appealing for savers willing to take the risk that the exchange rate will work in their favor. However, if the high interest rate is coupled with devaluation\u00a0of the currency being saved (as often happens with inflation) any gains in interest will be lost in currency exchange. Many foreign savings accounts have higher minimum deposits than traditional savings accounts. This means more of your money is at risk. As well, there are almost always currency exchange fees associated with changing between currencies. Opening a foreign account means you may have to pay them twice\u2014once for converting from the dollar into another currency, and once to convert your money back to dollars. These fees are generally priced as a percentage of the total amount being converted, which means they can take a big cut out of the interest you earned. Be sure to factor in these fees when comparing what the foreign account would yield compared with a domestic account. Investopedia / Mira Norian People with foreign savings accounts\u2014those located outside of the U.S.\u2014are required to file the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form known as the FBAR. This is true whether you opened the account at a local bank in that country or at a local branch of a U.S. bank, such as the Hong Kong branch of Citibank, for example. Not filing the FBAR has steep penalties.\u00a0You can be fined as much as $100,000, or half the amount in the foreign account, whichever is greater. If you have foreign accounts and are unsure about your tax status or which forms to file, it is worth hiring an accountant to protect your assets. If you're looking at this foreign account as an investment, not a savings account, just remember that you will be required to pay ordinary income tax on any income you earn through interest or currency exchange\u2014the same way that you pay income tax on earnings from an American savings account. If you had made that money by investing in the stock market, you would only owe capital gains tax on your earnings. Both of these tax rates vary depending on your tax bracket, but generally, capital gains tax rates are significantly lower than ordinary income taxes\u2014i.e., in the 24% income tax bracket, for example, you would likely pay 15% on long-term capital gains. Possible higher interest rates Easier access to funds for expatriates Can save on bank and transaction fees for those living in the non-U.S. country Exposure to currency market volatility Possible costly currency exchange rate and transaction fees Potential exposure to higher U.S. income tax rate, rather than just a capital gains tax There are a number of reasons why an American might be interested in having a foreign savings account. Those living abroad may find that opening an account in their country of residence makes it easier to access their funds and saves them money on bank and transaction fees. Saving in another currency works best for those with a high tolerance for risk and the willingness to track exchange rates and move fast, if necessary. Currency markets are extremely volatile, with values changing up to 10% or more on average in the most extreme market circumstances. There is the potential for large gains in a foreign savings account, but there is also the chance of large losses. While there may be some appealing reasons to entrust your savings to a foreign account, the U.S. stock market also offers investments that earn more than a domestic savings account, but without currency exchange fees. Additionally, you would only pay taxes at the capital gains rate, rather than at the ordinary income tax rate. If you are looking for a safer place to save your money and earn interest, consider investing in a certificate of deposit (CD) at a U.S. bank. CDs have a guaranteed return on investment at a higher interest rate than a traditional savings account and are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) up to $250,000\u00a0per depositor. A foreign savings account\u00a0provides investment opportunities, access to financial instruments in the country where it is held, and protection against possible economic turbulence in certain countries. Sometimes, banks located outside the U.S. pay higher savings interest rates as well. The IRS requires a U.S. \"person,\" including a citizen, resident, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust or estate, to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR)\u00a0that reports a financial interest in, or signature or other type of authority over, any financial account located outside the U.S. if the aggregate value of those accounts exceeded $10,000 at any time during the calendar year being reported. If you are considering opening a bank account outside the U.S., you can either open an account by visiting a bank branch or\u00a0you can open an account online. There are multiple providers that can offer these accounts, but each option and institution has its individual requirements and limitations. A foreign savings account is a type of investment used by U.S. investors to invest in a currency other than the dollar or by U.S. citizens living or working in other countries. Foreign savings account holders can benefit from interest and currency appreciation, and many non-U.S. savings accounts have higher minimum deposits than traditional savings accounts. Be aware, however, that people with foreign savings accounts\u2014those located outside of the U.S.\u2014are required to file the IRS form known as the FBAR to report the foreign account if the aggregate value of the accounts held there exceeded $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. There are also U.S. tax implications for these accounts because their income may be taxed at a higher rate than capital gains from investments. Further, currency rates can be volatile, which potentially can reduce or erase any large gains in a foreign savings account.

Similar to the confidentiality protections between doctors and patients or lawyers and their clients, these protections are the primary reason that Swiss bank accounts are so popular with wealthy banking customers around the world. Opening a Swiss bank account is not that much different from opening a standard bank account. You have to fill out forms and provide documentation that proves who you are and what you do. However, due to some special circumstances regarding privacy, the level of scrutiny over providing official documentation of your identity is more strict. For example, you may need to show your official passport to provide your identity, whereas a driver's license would probably suffice in the U.S. There are also different minimum balance requirements depending on the type of account you want. These can range from a few thousand dollars to millions of dollars. Nonresidents of Switzerland must be at least 18 years old to open a Swiss bank account, and that's about the only restriction. Account holders can choose their currency\u2014most hold their funds in Swiss francs, U.S. dollars,\u00a0euros,\u00a0or British Pound Sterling. There's usually no minimum balance required to open an account, but once an account holder deposits funds, there is typically a minimum balance requirement, which varies according to the bank. If you don't have that much idle cash, you might be better off looking for the best savings accounts in your own country. Swiss anti-money-laundering laws require a prospective Swiss bank account holder to provide several documents to open an account. These include authenticated copies of your passport and documents explaining your profession, such as tax returns, company documents, professional licenses, etc.; proof of the source of your funds; and other typical personal information. Some benefits of Swiss bank accounts are the low levels of financial risk and high levels of privacy. The Swiss economy has been known to be very stable, and the country has not been part of any major conflicts for some time. Furthermore, Swiss law requires that banks have high capital requirements and strong depositor protection, which protects deposits from financial crises and conflicts. Accounts held in Swiss Francs will earn a small amount of interest, but they'll also have to pay the Swiss withholding tax. For this reason, most foreign account holders have their Swiss bank account in another currency. Swiss law states that the bank can't disclose any information regarding an account (even its existence) without the depositor's permission. The only way information will be revealed is if a government agency says that a depositor is involved in a criminal act or some other financial issue (like bankruptcies, divorces, or inheritances). Furthermore, Swiss anti-money-laundering regulations also require depositors to provide proof regarding the origin of the funds they are placing in their accounts. Non-residents of Switzerland must be over age 18 and will need to provide their passport and other identification documents when they open an account, along with documentation showing their profession and the source of their funds. These documents are closely scrutinized in order to prevent money-laundering. While Swiss banks were once synonymous with money laundering and tax evasion, the opportunity for illegal activity diminished after Switzerland began exchanging information about account holders with other OECD nations in 2018. While Swiss banking laws still afford a high degree of privacy, it is now much less practical to use them for illegal purposes. Swiss banks may have a monthly charge for account holders, as well as minimum balance requirements. Requirements will vary from bank to bank. Popular culture has made Swiss banks synonymous with espionage and hidden wealth. While the country's banking secrecy laws still afford a high degree of privacy, strict anti-money laundering laws make the country a much less practical haven for ill-gotten wealth. Anyone over 18 is free to open a Swiss bank account, provided that they can provide identity documents and demonstrate the source of their wealth.

            "title": "4 Savings Accounts for Investors",
            "content": "If you're thinking about opening a savings account, do your research before committing. Not all savings accounts are created equal. The best account for you depends on several factors. These include your savings goals, the amount of money you have for an initial deposit,\u00a0the likelihood you may need to withdraw money prior to your target date, and your comfort using technology. Here are four types of accounts customers may use for savings, with a few points on what to watch for and what type of investors the accounts are best suited for. Also known as passbook savings accounts, these accounts are a good introduction to earning interest and saving money. Transactions on a basic savings account are updated either in a passbook when the customer visits their financial institution, or on a statement issued periodically (often monthly). Funds of up to $250,000 deposited in a basic savings account\u00a0are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), making this a good choice for investors who want a very low-risk and easy-to-access savings account. Money held in a credit union basic savings account\u00a0is insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). These accounts usually offer lower interest rates than other types of savings accounts\u00a0because of the flexibility in depositing and withdrawing funds. If you are new to savings, or want to teach your child about savings, a basic savings account can be a good option to get started. If you like the idea of online banking, an online savings account could be the\u00a0solution for you. These savings accounts may offer access to view, deposit, and transfer funds online 24/7, and withdraw money from an ATM anytime depending on the type of online savings account you set up. They may be accessible from any mobile device, including a tablet or smartphone. Deposits in these accounts may also be FDIC or NCUA insured. Fans of online savings accounts may choose them because they offer a relatively high interest rate compared to traditional basic savings accounts. As these accounts are not serviced in branches by staff members, they are less expensive for financial institutions to maintain. This often allows them to provide higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts. Online savings accounts are good options for tech-savvy customers looking for self-service banking and higher interest rates than basic, brick-and-mortar savings accounts. Banks and credit unions offer a specialized savings account known as money market accounts (MMAs). They may also be called money market\u00a0savings or deposit accounts. These are different from money market mutual funds offered by investment companies, which are not insured. Funds of up to $250,000 deposited in a bank MMA are insured by the FDIC.\ufeff\ufeff Money held in a credit union MMA is insured by the NCUA.\ufeff\ufeff These accounts may offer tiered interest levels and/or fee waivers for maintaining a certain balance each month. Money market accounts suit customers who want a higher interest rate than a basic bank account, and are willing to keep a larger balance in their account.\u00a0They are suitable for investors with savings goals with target dates ranging from a few months to a few years away. Funds may be withdrawn prior to that time. Certificate of deposit accounts (CDs) are a good savings account option for individuals saving for a goal with a defined target date in mind. Available through most financial institutions as well as some brokers, a CD usually pays a higher rate of interest than traditional and online accounts because\u00a0a fixed amount of your money is invested with the institution for a\u00a0specific length of time. This may range from a few months to one or more years. In most cases, the longer the term of the CD, the higher the interest rate paid. CDs of amounts up to $250,000 are insured by the FDIC or NCUA to protect investors in the event the issuer experiences financial issues. Consider a CD to save for\u00a0a large financial goal within the next five years such as a down payment for a home or an automobile purchase. There are several types of savings accounts available for investors. A basic savings account is a simple, easy-to-use, low-risk account with a lower rate of return suitable for beginning savers. An online account is a convenient, higher-interest account option for people comfortable with online banking. Money market savings accounts may offer perks such as better rates for higher balances. And certificate of deposit accounts pay a premium rate for locking a fixed savings amount in for a specified duration ranging from a few months to five years. Deposits to these savings accounts are insured by FDIC or NCUA for amounts up to $250,000.

            "title": "Individual Development Account (IDA): What it is, How it Works",
            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. An\u00a0individual development account (IDA) is a type of savings account designed to help low-income individuals build assets and achieve financial stability and long-term self-sufficiency. People use IDAs to save money to start a business, pay for education, or buy a home. IDAs help people build financial stability in several ways. To qualify for an IDA, an individual may have to complete free financial literacy training, which teaches subjects like money management, debt reduction, and investing. An IDA will also help make savings go farther: As in a 401(k), the money a person saves in an IDA is then matched (in this case by private or public funds), increasing the total account value. Participants open an account with an approved financial institution and make recurring deposits over a set period of time. The funds are then matched, often at a 2:1 or 1:1 ratio (the exact amount matched varies depending on the state and program). To qualify for an individual development account, participants must meet specific criteria related to income, assets, and employment. Program eligibility criteria vary by program, but most require that your income be less than two times the federal poverty level, that you have income from a job, and that you attend financial literacy programs. Other criteria might include meeting certain asset limits, your citizenship or legal resident status, and having credit. IDAs started in the 1990s as a way to reduce poverty. In the late 1990s, IDAs started to receive federal funding from the Assets for Independence Act (AFIA) and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. There are hundreds of IDA programs across the country. However, the Assets for Independence (AFI) program behind many IDAs was defunded starting in 2017. Since then, individual states have been working to fill in the gaps in funding. Having an IDA won't harm your supplemental security income (SSI) benefit, if you receive one. That's because the money you deposit, the matching funds, and any interest you earn don't count as earned income. You can make investment decisions with an IRA and move money in and out. With an IDA a trustee controls the money that is deposited and withdrawn. Once you reach your savings goal, you can remove money from an IDA with the approval of the trustee. You can qualify for an IDA by meeting income requirements, which are generally a certain percentage of the poverty level in your area, such as 200% of the poverty level. If you have low income and want to build assets, an\u00a0individual development account (IDA) may be a good tool to help you achieve financial stability and long-term self-sufficiency. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for more guidance on how to reach your financial goals.

            "content": "There are a number of tradeoffs to consider Choosing the right type of savings account can be confusing. Are you better off with a certificate of deposit (CD)? A traditional savings account? A money market account (MMA)? They're all taxable accounts you can open at a bank or credit union, and they're protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Each account has pros and cons, and the right choice for you will depend on how much money you have and your personal needs. Take note that these are just average tendencies. The actual rate you get for any one of these accounts depends on the issuing bank or credit union. Investopedia / Zoe Hansen These simple accounts are one of the most basic ways to bank your money. A savings account is a good choice for a young person\u2019s first bank account or anyone needing easy cash access. Most banks don\u2019t require a large deposit to open a savings account. $25 is often sufficient, and some accounts have no minimum required opening deposit. You may need to keep a minimum balance in the account to avoid a monthly fee, which may range from $25 to $1,000 or more, depending on the bank and the account. You may be given an ATM card to make withdrawals but the bank or credit union may impose withdrawal limits, and you must be careful not to go below the minimum balance required. If your savings and checking accounts are with the same bank, you'll likely be able to quickly transfer money between the accounts or use your savings account for overdraft protection. A linked savings account makes moving cash from savings to checking especially easy. However, some banks and credit unions may charge a fee for such a transfer. Depending on the account, you may not earn that much interest\u2014savings account rates are lower, on average, compared to most other savings vehicles. However, some exceptions exist. A high-yield savings account (HYSA) usually offers significantly higher interest rates. These are typically offered by online-only banks, with rates that may beat even money market accounts. There are no federal restrictions on how many accounts or banks you use to store your money. Can open a basic savings account with a small deposit Often no fees charged if you maintain a minimum balance Easy to transfer money to a linked checking account FDIC- or NCUA-protected for up to $250,000 Lower interest rates on average compared to most other savings vehicles Getting the best rate may require shopping around for a new bank or credit union Low interest rates may not keep up with inflation High-yield savings accounts may have extra requirements Banks and credit unions also offer another type of savings account, the money market account. MMAs are similar to traditional savings accounts but offer higher annual percentage yields (APYs), on average. However, there can be a few catches. You may also need a larger deposit to open the account\u2014$1,000 is common\u2014and you might need to maintain a higher balance to avoid fees. Some money market accounts require a higher balance to earn a higher interest rate. Unlike traditional savings accounts, which often pay a flat annual interest rate, many MMAs have a tiered interest rate, with higher rates for larger balances. This makes them desirable if you can maintain a high daily account balance. The best money market account rates may be competitive with the best savings and CD rates. Money market accounts are not the same as money market mutual funds, which are a type of low-volatility, lower-risk investment vehicle. MMAs also allow users to write checks from the account or use an ATM card for withdrawals and payments. However, because the institution may limit your transactions and withdrawals, a money market account isn't as suitable for daily expenses as a checking account. Money market accounts differ widely\u2014you'll need to closely review terms and account disclosures. The MMA offered by your credit union or bank may not have tiered savings, minimum balances, or monthly fees. Higher interest rates than a traditional savings account, on average Often have the ability to write checks No-penalty withdrawals and additions FDIC- or NCUA-protected for up to $250,000 Higher balance sometimes needed to avoid monthly fees Potential limits on the number of monthly withdrawals Best interest rates may require higher balances When opening a certificate of deposit account, you provide the bank with a lump sum of money for a fixed period\u2014as short as a month or as long as ten years, as you choose. At the maturity date, when the term ends, you can withdraw your funds and close the account or renew the CD at then-current rates. CD interest rates tend to be higher than those of traditional savings accounts and MMAs, on average. CDs may therefore be desirable for savers who can make large deposits and won't need access to the money during the CD\u2019s term. CDs are FDIC-or NCUA-insured for up to $250,000. However, there's a trade-off. You will usually face a steep penalty fee for early withdrawals, typically several months' interest. You usually can't add money to a CD after it's opened, although some banks and credit unions offer CDs with this option. The types of specialized CDs available can be overwhelming at times. Types include: The tradeoff for these CD types is often a lower interest rate and fewer term choices compared to accounts with the most competitive rates. While many institutions offer CDs with $0 minimum deposits, the best CD rates may in some cases be found with institutions requiring larger deposits, ranging from $500 to $10,000. As with MMAs, CDs with higher balances may offer higher rates.\u00a0CDs generally have fixed interest rates, which could leave you stuck at a low APY if overall rates increase. But fixed interest rates also allow you to lock in a high rate, which is valuable if overall rates decrease. The particular bank and term length you choose can significantly impact your interest rate.\u00a0Shop around to find the top CD rates, which change frequently. Higher average interest rates than traditional savings accounts and MMAs FDIC- or NCUA-protected for up to $250,000 per depositor per institution Easy to open online, with plenty of terms and types available, including bump-up and variable-rate CDs In most cases, steep penalties for early withdrawals and no partial withdrawals A fixed interest rate won't grow if overall interest rates increase Remembering to manage your CD at maturity could take some work MMAs and CDs share some features, but there are important differences. MMAs are similar to traditional savings accounts but may require a large deposit to open, such as $1,000. You can add to or withdraw from your MMA. A high minimum balance can help you avoid fees and access higher interest rates. CDs require owners to leave their money untouched for a fixed amount of time, and they tend to pay higher rates than MMAs. Early withdrawals from CDs typically come with steep penalties, unlike MMAs. Money market accounts are good for those with large amounts of cash to deposit, and those who want the ability to access their funds by check or ATM card. MMAs allow you to add funds over time, increasing your deposit. CDs can be better for those who don't mind locking up a set deposit for several months to several years in return for a fixed interest rate. CDs are useful when saving up for a specific, time-defined goal\u2014such as buying a car or home in 12 to 18 months In general, money market accounts are more liquid than CDs. In fact, most CDs have early withdrawal penalties, while MMAs do not (some MMAs may have withdrawal limits, however). That said, CDs will often pay higher interest rates, because your funds are committed to that bank or credit union. Some no-penalty CDs don't come with fees, but you may earn a lower interest rate. When deciding if a traditional savings account, MMA, or CD is best for you, consider how much you can deposit initially, how frequently you need access to your savings, and how much you\u2019d like to earn in interest. Due to competition among financial institutions for deposits, you may find higher rates in surprising places\u2014either a CD, high-yield savings account, or money market account\u2014and not necessarily at your current bank or credit union. If you'll need the money for bills or emergencies or want to add to your funds, a traditional savings account or MMA is the best choice. If you can afford to leave a large sum of money untouched for\u00a0a long stretch of time, a CD may be the better option.

Chase Bank offers two different savings account options with below-average APYs Ekaterina Goncharova/Getty Images Chase savings accounts only pay 0.01%\u20130.02% APY\u2014that's lower than the national average, and significantly less than the best high-yield savings accounts. The accounts come with monthly fees as well, unless you qualify to have them waived. Chase Bank, founded over 220 years ago in New York City, is the largest financial institution in the United States, with over 4,700 branches and 16,000 ATMs. The full-service bank offers a wide variety of financial services, including two savings account options, other types of deposit accounts, rewards credit cards, and numerous other financing options. Chase\u2019s savings account rates may vary by location, and the rates listed below may not be available in all ZIP codes. The APYs listed below use NYC ZIP code 10001. To earn the higher end of the rate range with the Chase Premier Savings account (the \"relationship rate\"), you\u2019ll need to link a Chase Premier Plus Checking account or a Chase Sapphire Checking account. From there, you must make a minimum of five eligible transactions per month from your linked checking account to qualify for the higher APY on your savings account. Chase\u2019s savings account interest rates fall well below the national average. So if you\u2019re looking to grow your savings at a faster pace, you\u2019ll want to look elsewhere for more attractive APYs. (However, some of the Chase's CD rates are typically more competitive, depending on the term.) Although both of Chase Bank\u2019s savings accounts come with monthly maintenance fees, customers have a few different ways to qualify for fee waivers. If you\u2019re interested in opening a savings account with Chase, here\u2019s how to get the bank to waive the cost of your $5 or $25 monthly fee. The monthly fee of the basic Chase Savings Account is waived for any of the following situations: The monthly fee of the Chase Premier Savings Account is waived for any of the following situations: Although Chase\u2019s savings accounts once came with withdrawal limits, they do not currently have any limits. You can make as many withdrawals as you'd like each month for no charge. No minimum deposit requirements Doesn't charge excess withdrawal fees Easy access to funds Below-average interest rates Monthly fees No additional features The Fed cut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing them by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%\u20135.00% at its Sept. 18, 2024, meeting. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means savings rates will decline after reaching heights not seen in more than 20 years. You can open an account online, through the Chase app on your phone or tablet, or by visiting a branch in person. To open an account from your computer or mobile device, follow these steps: Chase has another deposit account solution available for customers who are looking for options to store their cash savings: fixed-rate certificates of deposit (CD)s. Customers can open CDs with a variety of terms at varying interest rates; see Chase\u2019s CD rates for more information. Chase is the banking subsidiary of J.P. Morgan Chase, a financial holding company. It can trace its history back to 1799, when it was initially launched as the Chase Manhattan Corporation. It merged with J.P. Morgan & Co. to form J.P Morgan Chase in 2000. Today, it's the largest bank in the country based on assets. Chase operates more than 4,700 branches and 15,000 ATMs. You can also manage your account, transfer money, and deposit checks through the Chase mobile app and online banking. Chase is well-known for its wide array of credit card products, including some of the most popular rewards credit cards on the market. And Chase also offers some decent bank account bonuses for new banking customers who are eligible for the right accounts through the financial institution. If you're looking to earn more on your savings balance or get access to better features, there are a handful of alternatives worth considering. If you want more features to help you save more money, some online savings accounts offer tools that can help you automatically save more money based on your spending or make it easier to track individual savings goals. The SoFi checking/savings account, for example, allows you to round up purchases to the nearest dollar and transfer the difference to savings. Many online banks, and even some traditional banks and credit unions, provide high-yield savings accounts, which offer APYs much higher than the national average. Some may offer rates as high as 5.0% or better. A money market account acts as a hybrid between a checking and savings account, giving you easy access to your funds and often a higher yield on your balance. Just keep in mind that you may still be subject to a monthly withdrawal limit of some kind. Additionally, many money market accounts also charge monthly fees, which can usually be waived much like savings accounts. If you don't need access to your cash for a while, you may consider locking in a fixed interest rate on a CD. Depending on the financial institution, CD terms can range from less than one month to several years. CDs let you lock in a specific APY for the entire term, unlike savings accounts, but you\u2019ll typically pay a withdrawal penalty if you take out the money before maturity. The best CD accounts are often better than the best savings accounts, but it varies by bank. Depending on your savings goals, you may be able to meet those goals and get a good return on your balance by buying U.S. Treasury bonds. T-bills have terms ranging from four weeks to one year. Series I savings bonds require you to wait at least 12 months before you can redeem (and charge a penalty if you cash in before five years), but they can offer a great way to earn a higher return because they're designed to keep up with inflation. To determine the best place to put your savings, consider the purpose of the money, when you'll need it, and how often you\u2019ll have to withdraw. If it's an emergency fund, for instance, avoid putting it in an account that requires you to lock in the money for a set period. There are many banks and credit unions with savings accounts, and making sense of the available options can be challenging. To help you choose the best savings account for your needs, we compared Chase with accounts from two other leading bank account providers: Capital One and Wells Fargo. Like Chase, Capital One offers a variety of financial products, including checking and savings accounts. There is no minimum deposit required to open a savings account. And, unlike Chase, Capital One doesn't charge monthly maintenance fees. Capital One also offers a significantly higher APY on its 360 Performance Savings account, its flagship account, than Chase offers. However, Capital One operates fewer branches than Chase; there are only 262 active branches in nine states, as of 2024. If you prefer to visit a bank in person rather than rely on online platforms or mobile apps, Chase may be a better fit. Wells Fargo is the third-largest commercial bank in the country based on assets, and it offers deposit accounts, loans, and credit cards. Unlike Chase and Capital One, Wells Fargo requires customers to deposit at least $25 to open an account. However, it tends to have higher rates than Chase, though only users with balances of $100,000 or more in a Platinum Savings account with a linked Premier Checking account will earn an elevated rate. Chase Bank does not currently offer a high-yield savings account option. Although for the most part it\u2019s a full-service bank, it does not offer money market accounts either. To see the top rates on the market today, take a look at the best high-yield savings accounts or the best money market account rates. Chase Savings Accounts do not have minimum balance requirements to open a new account. However, if you want to avoid paying the $5 monthly fee (Chase Savings account) or the $25 monthly fee (Chase Premier Savings account), you\u2019ll need to either maintain certain account minimums or satisfy other requirements to qualify for a fee waiver each month. Many financial institutions charge bank fees to increase profits and help cover operating expenses. However, you can find free savings accounts and free checking accounts that offer fee-free banking services if these are important to you. Today, there's no limit to the number of withdrawals or transfers you can make from your Chase savings account. Like many other banks, Chase used to charge a $5 savings withdrawal fee for every withdrawal or transfer out after the sixth withdrawal in a given month. However, with the suspension of Regulation D, Chase changed its policy, and it no longer charges fees for making more than six withdrawals per month. Banks make money by using customer deposits to fund loans and investments. In exchange, they typically offer interest on savings accounts to attract deposits. That said, traditional banks like Chase typically have higher overhead costs than online banks due to their physical branches. As a result, they often can't afford to pay the same high yields. Additionally, the bank may have sufficient deposits to meet its operating needs and doesn't feel the need to compete with financial institutions that offer higher rates. Yes, all Chase Bank deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). With FDIC insurance, your deposits are protected for up to $250,000 (per ownership category) in the unlikely event of a bank failure. Chase Bank compounds interest paid to its customers on a monthly basis. The bank credits any interest earned to its customers\u2019 deposit accounts once a month as well. Chase is a reputable bank and financial institution, and it has no minimum opening deposit. However, it offers less-than-stellar interest rates on savings accounts, and you can find significantly higher APYs from other banks and credit unions. The best high-yield savings accounts have rates that are often 10 to 15 times higher than Chase's rates.

            "content": "There are two internationally recognized, standardized methods of identifying bank accounts when a bank transfer is being made from one country to another: an International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and a Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) code. The primary difference between the two methods lies in what information the codes convey. An IBAN is used to identify an individual bank account involved in an international transaction while a SWIFT code is used to identify a specific bank during an international transaction. Both IBANs and SWIFT codes are essential components of the process by which individuals can transfer money overseas, and they both play an essential role in\u00a0the smooth running of the international financial market. An IBAN allows for the easy identification of the country where the bank is located\u00a0and the account number of the recipient of the money transfer. The IBAN also acts as a method of checking that the transaction details are correct. The number starts with a two-digit country code, then two numbers, followed by up to three to five alphanumeric characters. This method of checking and identification is used within the majority of European Union (EU) countries and other European countries. In 1997, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) first developed a system of standardization for IBANs. The ISO is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national standards organizations. However, concerns were raised, mainly by the European Committee for Banking Standards (now the European Payments Council, the decision-making and coordination body of the European banking industry) that there was too much flexibility within the proposed standards. The reworked version of the standard included a ruling that required the IBAN for each country to be a fixed length. It also stipulated that only uppercase letters could be used within the IBAN. The SWIFT system is a messaging network that financial institutions use to securely transmit information and instructions through a standardized system of codes. It was formed in 1973. The SWIFT system assigns each financial organization a unique code that has either eight characters or 11 characters. It remains the method by which the majority of international fund transfers are made. One of the main reasons is the SWIFT messaging system allows banks to share a significant amount of financial data, including the status of the account, debit and credit amounts, and details related to the money transfer. Being able to access both IBANs and SWIFT codes is essential to ensuring a quick and successful international transfer. The identifier required by the bank depends on the bank being used, the recipient's bank, and the countries in which the transfer is originated and received. However, without either, the chances of the transfer being completed successfully diminish considerably. If you're making a SWIFT transfer and are unable to provide an IBAN, you'll need to include other information to identify the specific receiving bank account, such as a bank account number. An IBAN consists of 32 alphanumeric characters, including a two-digit country code and a two-digit checksum. This is enough to identify an individual bank account, as well as the bank and country of the recipient. A SWIFT code has 8 to 11 alphanumeric characters. This includes four letters to identify the recipient's bank, a two-letter country code, a two-digit location code, and an optional three digits to identify the specific branch. Unlike IBAN codes, a SWIFT code does not identify a specific account number. IBANs are commonly used for transfers in the EU and neighboring countries. Banks in the United States and Canada do not have IBANs, but they do recognize the system and use these numbers to process outgoing international transfers. SWIFT codes are more universal than IBAN and are the default standard outside of Europe. In addition, while IBAN is mainly restricted to banks, SWIFT is also used by other institutions, such as clearinghouses and brokerages. Investopedia / Joules Garcia TR330006100519786457841326 is an example of an arbitrary IBAN for an account in Turkey. The characters in this number are explained as follows: BOFAUS3NXXX is a representative code for messages in the SWIFT system. In this example: The optional suffix XXX indicates the bank's head office. Before the introduction of these identification methods, there were no internationally recognized, standardized methods of identifying bank accounts. The information that one country used to identify the bank and individual accounts of the sending country was not necessarily recognized by the receiving country. Lack of standard practice meant there was no way to ensure the information entered was correct. As a result, payments could theoretically be made to the wrong people or organizations. Similarly, payments could be delayed while the identifying details were confirmed. Missed, delayed, and mistaken payments caused additional costs to both sending and receiving banks. The introduction of these identification methods was crucial in helping to streamline the process of making international money transfers. You can usually find your bank's SWIFT code on an account statement, or on your bank's website. If your bank has an IBAN number, you can usually find it on an account statement or on the bank's website. In addition, some European banks print their IBAN on the customer's bank cards. You can also verify this number using an online IBAN tool. IBAN is the most common standard for international transfers between countries in the Eurozone and neighboring regions, such as Turkey, Israel, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. IBAN is also used elsewhere, although it is less universal than the SWIFT system. IBAN and SWIFT are the two common standards for sending international bank wires. Both can be used to identify a recipient's bank, so that other parties can send money to them, even across borders. IBAN is the leading standard within Europe and neighboring countries, although the SWIFT system extends worldwide.

            "title": "Deposit Interest Rate: Definition, Fixed Vs. Variable",
            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. SDI Productions / Getty Images A deposit interest rate is paid by financial institutions to deposit account holders. Deposit accounts include certificates of deposit (CD), savings accounts, and self-directed deposit retirement accounts. It is similar to a \"depo rate,\" which can refer to interest paid on the interbank market. Deposit accounts are attractive places to park cash for investors who want a safe vehicle for preserving their capital, earning a small amount of fixed interest, and taking advantage of insurance such as that provided by the\u00a0Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)\u00a0and\u00a0National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Most investment portfolios reserve a small allocation of the money invested to deposit accounts, as they provide the benefit of liquidity and capital preservation. Financial institutions typically offer better rates for accounts holding larger balances. This is used as an incentive to attract high-value clients with considerable assets. When attaining a higher interest rate, naturally the greater the sum deposited, the larger the return over time. The fixed interest rates guaranteed with certain deposit accounts tend to be lower than the more variable returns of other financial vehicles. The tradeoff is that the account holder is assured of gradual gains to their deposit versus the potential for sudden profits or even loses with higher-risk investments. While this may still be seen as a slower growth approach for returns, such accounts can offer more stability than more volatile, high-risk financial products. For instance, a certificate of deposit with a fixed rate is assured to furnish the stated return when the account reaches maturity. There are also CD accounts that offer variable rates, but these are still typically no-risk products. In the case of certain self-directed deposit retirement accounts, the various types of investments being made can include real estate, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and notes. Banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions tend to offer competitive interest rates for these deposits to better attract customers. Depending on the product, premium deposit interest rates may only be available under certain terms such as minimum balances, and possibly maximums. Financial institutions encourage long-term deposits not only for the client\u2019s benefit in the form of extended interest earned, but also because they offer more liquidity to the institution. Some accounts also require a set length of time\u2014six months, one year, or multiple years\u2014that the money must remain deposited and not accessed by the account holder. If the deposit is accessed and withdrawn early, there may be penalties and fees incurred, including the potential loss of the agreed-upon interest rate if the balance remaining in the account falls below a minimum. By having more cash on deposit, an institution can make more lending transactions, such as loans and credit cards, available to its customers. The amount of interest you earn will depend on the interest rate offered and how much you have deposited in the account. The more money you put in and the higher the interest rate, the more interest you will earn. Generally, online banks pay better interest rates than bricks-and-mortar banks. Yes, banks that provide interest-bearing deposit accounts will always offer a deposit interest rate. The amount of interest paid to your account is influenced by whether the interest rate is calculated separately for each day, or whether it is based on the average deposit or the minimum balance for each month. The account balance is the amount of savings in the account. You can get a better interest rate for an account when the interest is calculated based on the daily balance or the average deposit, because this method corresponds better to the fluctuation in the value of your savings. A deposit interest rate is paid by financial institutions to deposit account holders. These accounts, like savings, CDs, and self-directed retirement accounts, are attractive for investors as a safe vehicle for maintaining their principal, earning some fixed interest, and for being covered by deposit insurance. However, the fixed interest rates guaranteed with deposit accounts tend to be small compared with the variable and often higher returns of other financial vehicles.

Be aware of Bank of America\u2019s savings account fees Lindsay VanSomeren is a credit, credit card, and banking expert with almost a decade of experience writing for prominent personal finance sites like Forbes Advisor and Northwestern Mutual. She has a bachelor's and a master's degree in wildlife biology and conservation from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. valentinrussanov/Getty Images Bank of America savings account interest rates, at a maximum of 0.04% APY for the highest tier, are an all-around disappointment. In today\u2019s rising interest rate environment, where many banks offer interest rate increases just about every other week, Bank of America is holding onto the absolute bare minimum rate possible for the average customer. In addition, BofA also charges a monthly fee unless you\u2019re diligent about qualifying for a waiver each month. You can boost your rate if you maintain many thousands of dollars on deposit, but you\u2019d still lag behind virtually any high-yield savings account. Unless you have a compelling reason to stick with Bank of America for your savings journey, we recommend choosing another bank. You could potentially earn far more in interest with just about any other bank, especially if you\u2019re comfortable choosing an online-only option. Some banks offer several types of savings accounts for people in different situations, but not Bank of America: It only offers one option, the Bank of America Advantage Savings account. Instead, it modifies this single bank account to waive fees or offer higher rates depending on your circumstances. The different savings account tiers (Gold, Platinum, Platinum Honors) refer to the levels of Bank of America\u2019s Preferred Rewards program; the more money you hold in eligible Bank of America and Merrill Lynch accounts, the higher your tier. Gold requires at least $20,000; Platinum requires $50,000; and Platinum Honors requires $100,000. The base savings account charges an $8 monthly fee, although it\u2019s waived for the first six months after you open the account. After that, you can qualify for a monthly fee waiver in a few different ways: Keep in mind that each of these options is either a limited-duration event, or will require active monitoring on your part each month to ensure you\u2019re not charged a fee. You\u2019ll also be charged a $10 fee if you make more than six withdrawals each month, regardless of the method, and a $2.50 ATM fee for using non-Bank of America ATMs (plus any third-party ATM fees charged by the machine\u2019s operator). In return for all of these fees, you\u2019ll earn just about the lowest rate that any bank in the country is offering right now. Any interest you are able to earn will be compounded monthly and credited to your account with each statement cycle. Large branch and ATM network Minors, eligible students, and others can qualify for monthly service fee waivers Automatic transfers between deposit accounts APYs significantly lower than national average $8 monthly service fee $100 opening deposit Follow these steps to open a new Bank of America Savings account: If you're an existing Bank of America customer looking to stash a relatively small amount for short-term emergencies, a BofA savings account could be convenient. And if you have a qualifying checking account or maintain a $500 balance, Bank of America will waive the monthly fee. However, Bank of America's APYs are significantly lower than the national average for savings accounts. For larger sums or for those who don't have a Bank of America checking account, a high-yield savings account from another bank or credit union likely makes more sense. In addition to savings accounts and certificates of deposit, Bank of America offers a full suite of other financial products as well, making it a one-stop shop. The general pattern among all of these accounts is that unless you qualify for a Preferred Rewards tier, you\u2019ll earn interest rates so low you\u2019ll hardly see anything accrue and you\u2019ll be constantly working to avoid fees as well. If you keep at least $20,000 deposited with Bank of America, you\u2019ll be able to qualify for the lowest-level Gold Tier in its Preferred Rewards program. If you really want to bank with Bank of America, we recommend aiming for this level at a minimum since this will, at least, waive your monthly fees. Higher balances (up to $1,000,000 or more) come with more benefits, but remember you\u2019ll want to avoid keeping more than $250,000 with any one bank in order to make sure your money is fully protected by FDIC insurance. Bank of America is one of the largest financial institutions in the world. In the U.S., it's the second-largest commercial bank based on assets; only J.P. Morgan Chase is larger. Bank of America serves over 69 million customers in the U.S., and it operates approximately 3,800 branches and 15,000 ATMs. It was initially launched in 1904. Today, it's based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Like many other financial institutions, Bank of America has been the subject of controversy and regulatory action. In 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered Bank of America to pay more than $100 million to affected consumers for improperly charging fees. Bank of America has a wide network of branches and ATMs that could be appealing to some. However, its savings accounts offer low rates and they aren\u2019t the best option to build your savings. Below are four alternatives to Bank of America savings accounts you may want to consider. The Fed cut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing them by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%\u20135.00% at its Sept. 18, 2024, meeting. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means savings rates will decline after reaching heights not seen in more than 20 years. Before opening a new bank account, it's a good idea to shop around to compare the fees and rates offered by multiple banks and credit unions. Savings account deposit requirements, annual percentage yields (APYs), and fees vary significantly by institution. Here\u2019s how Bank of America stacks up to two other major institutions, American Express and Chase. If your focus is on earning more interest without paying monthly fees (or worrying about meeting requirements to waive those fees), America Express could be a useful option. Its High Yield Savings Account has no minimum opening deposit requirement, and unlike Bank of America, it doesn't charge monthly maintenance fees. Plus, its savings account pays a much higher-than-average APY, so it's a good choice for those looking to make their money grow. Chase is the only bank larger than Bank of America (by assets), and it has multiple savings account options. While Bank of America requires at least $100 to open an account, Chase doesn't have a minimum deposit requirement. However, it does charge monthly fees for its savings accounts\u2014as high as $25, though fees can be waived by meeting certain requirements. The accounts offer low APYs, however. No, Bank of America does not offer a high-yield savings account. If you keep enough money on deposit with Bank of America ($20,000 or more), you may qualify for a higher-level interest rate tier, but even then, the rates are extremely low. Check out the best high-yield savings accounts to see the top rates available today. You can make up to six withdrawals per month from a Bank of America Savings account. This limit applies to all withdrawal methods\u2014in person at a branch location, online, via ATM, etc. If you go above that, Bank of America will charge you a $10 excessive withdrawal fee for each instance, up to six times per month (a potential total of $60 in penalty fees each month). You can open a savings account online directly on the Bank of America website. If you live near a branch location, you can also apply for an account in person. You\u2019ll need to provide a few bits of information on your application, including your Social Security number, contact information, and the routing and account number for your current bank account. You need at least $100 for a minimum deposit to open a new Bank of America savings account. Yes, Bank of America savings accounts are FDIC-insured up to the standard $250,000. The bank does offer extra bonuses and perks if you deposit more money beyond this level, but because your money isn\u2019t protected in these cases, it\u2019s not recommended practice to do this. No, Bank of America does not have a free savings account available for the general public. Certain people may qualify for a waiver based on their demographic characteristics, notably minors under age 18 and students under age 25. You can also qualify for a monthly fee waiver if you meet certain requirements each month, such as becoming a Preferred Rewards member; but if not, you\u2019ll be charged $8 per month. Bank of America\u2019s Advantage Savings account has an $8 monthly fee. However, you can qualify for a fee waiver if you meet one of the following requirements: Bank of America has a large network of in-person branches. Unlike online banks that have lower overhead, Bank of America has a lot of expenses to cover. The high cost of running an organization so large likely impacts the interest rates that Bank of America is able and willing to offer its customers. Bank of America has lower-than-average rates on its savings accounts, so your money won't accrue very much in interest. If your goal is to grow your money as quickly as possible, a high-yield savings account is likely a better choice.

            "title": "Why Choose a Money Market Account Instead of a Savings Account?",
            "content": "Investopedia / Alex Dos Diaz Banks and credit unions offer several options for saving your money. A traditional savings account provides access to your funds while paying you interest. However, a money market account\u2014a hybrid between a checking and savings account\u2014also pays interest, offers check-writing, and access to funds via a debit card. Discover the advantages and disadvantages of a money market account and savings account. Most banks\u2014both traditional brick-and-mortar and online institutions\u2014offer savings accounts and money market accounts. At first glance, these two accounts are similar\u2014both are deposit accounts that pay interest. Money market accounts can pay higher interest than traditional savings accounts, but money markets may also come with a higher minimum balance requirement and opening deposit amount. Monthly fees, balance requirements, and interest paid vary by bank. Be sure to research before opening a money market or savings account since some banks offer interest on savings accounts that rival the rates of money market accounts. Your deposits in money market accounts and savings accounts are federally insured up to certain limits, depending on the ownership category. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides deposit insurance for financial institutions and banks, while the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) provides insurance for credit unions. Account holders may face limits on the number of withdrawals each month from a money market and savings account. The limits were established under federal regulations since these accounts were designed for saving rather than everyday banking. Before April 24, 2020, as stipulated by the Federal Reserve's\u00a0Regulation D, savings deposit account holders were restricted to six withdrawals or transfers per month. If more than six withdrawals were made, an account could be charged a penalty. The withdrawal limitation has been removed, but some banks may still place limits on withdrawals. Banks offer savings accounts to their customers as a complement to their checking accounts. Savings accounts can be a good place for people to put their cash for short-term needs such as home renovations, vacations, cars, or emergencies like medical or dental bills. Banks make building a savings account balance fairly easy. The account can be added to a debit card to make deposits and withdrawals, transfers through online banking, and wire payments directly into the account from other institutions. Customers can access and withdraw funds easily, providing consumers with ready access to cash. A savings account may provide a low interest rate on deposits, although some banks offer higher rates than others. According to the FDIC, the average national rate of interest for a savings account with a $2,500 balance was 0.45% in October 2024. Savings accounts may offer lower interest rates than money market accounts and other investments because financial institutions\u00a0are limited in what they can do with the funds. Banks generally lend this money to others for car loans, lines of credit, and credit cards so the banks can make money on the interest they charge. Money market accounts are less common than traditional savings accounts and are sometimes called money market deposit accounts. A money market account is a hybrid since it offers the features of a checking and savings account. Certain money market accounts provide check-writing and debit card transactions. Money market accounts have a savings account-like feature, where account holders collect interest on the balance they hold at the end of each month. Money market accounts may offer a slightly higher interest rate than a traditional savings account. Be sure to research the various rates banks and credit unions offer. The average interest rate for a money market account was 0.61% for averaged balances between $10,000 and $100,000 products in October 2024. Banks can invest the money account holders deposit into money market accounts in highly liquid, short-term, low-risk securities. These include certificates of deposit (CDs), government bonds, or other similar investments. When these assets mature, they give money market account holders a portion of the interest they receive. Money market accounts often come with a tiered balance option, meaning the more money deposited, the higher the interest rate on deposits. Money market accounts come with minimum balance requirements. Customers who don't meet the required balance may lose out on interest or find their account converted to a regular checking or savings account. Also, money market accounts may restrict the number of withdrawal and debit transactions similar to a regular savings account. It's possible to incur a fee if you exceed six monthly transactions. Money market accounts differ from money market funds, which are a type of mutual fund. Money market deposit accounts differ from money market funds, also called money market mutual funds. These accounts are not deposit accounts but are a type of investment account offered by investment firms. Money market funds are not savings or checking accounts. Investors can buy and sell shares in money market funds, which invest in highly liquid assets such as cash and equivalents, government securities, and high-rated debt-based assets that mature in less than 13 months. Money market funds don't come with FDIC protection, and investment returns are not guaranteed. Money market accounts can offer you immediate access to your funds almost whenever you need the money. Money market accounts often offer check-writing or access via a debit card, and you can usually withdraw funds without paying a fee. One of the biggest disadvantages of a money market account is that\u00a0some financial institutions may cap how many convenient withdrawals you can make each month. The Federal Reserve once limited consumers to six per month, though this rule was phased out in 2020. Also, a higher balance will be required to earn a better interest rate in these accounts. Money market accounts are considered safe. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures these products for up to $250,000 per depositor per account ownership category. At credit unions, money market accounts receive the same level of protection from the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Savings and money market accounts offer a deposit account for your savings that pays interest and can be accessed fairly easily. However, some may choose\u00a0money market accounts\u00a0over savings accounts because they offer\u00a0higher interest rates. While the difference in earned interest can be small, it\u00a0might be enough to offset possible withdrawal limits posed by money market accounts.

            "title": "Negotiable Order of Withdrawal Account: Overview, History",
            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. Marco VDM / Getty Images A Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) Account is an interest-earning demand deposit account. A\u00a0customer with such an account is permitted to write drafts against money held on deposit. A Negotiable Order of Withdrawal Account is also known as a \"NOW Account.\" In the search to optimize returns on liquid funds, investors have several choices, including: interest-bearing checking accounts, high yield savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs). People seeking these types of accounts most often turn to commercial banks, mutual savings banks, and savings and loan associations. Up until 2011, NOW Accounts were a viable choice for consumers looking to get at least some return from their idle cash. Prior to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, U.S. banking regulations distinguished between \"NOW Accounts\" and \"demand deposit accounts\"\u2014although similarities existed. This was because Regulation Q (Reg Q) prohibited banks from paying any interest on demand deposit checking accounts. NOW Accounts and Super NOW Accounts were demand deposit alternatives with a temporary holding period that could actually pay some interest. In 2011, Dodd-Frank repealed Req Q, allowing banks to pay interest on demand deposits, which basically eliminated any advantage that NOW Accounts offered. The history of preventing depositors from earning interest on accounts dates back to the\u00a0Great Depression. Significant bank turmoil marked this era in the 1930s. Many viewed the interest payments on demand deposits as \u201cexcessive competition,\u201d leading to diminished profit margins. This was primarily a factor for large New York banks. As\u00a0interest rates\u00a0rose in the 1950s, many banks began trying to get around the ban. This started with non-monetary rewards, such as offering more convenient features, additional branch offices, and giveaways of consumer goods to attract new customers. Implicit interest also gradually gained traction. This included preferred loan rates. Banks often correlated these with a customer's demand deposit balances. Banks also began to display below-cost charges for common services, such as check-clearing. Ronald Haselton, the former president and chief executive officer of the Worcester, Massachusetts-based Consumer Savings Bank, was the first to develop the NOW Account officially. This became a direct challenge to the ban on interest payments on deposit accounts. In 1974, Congress permitted NOW Accounts in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. In 1976, the allowance was extended to all New England with a 5% interest rate ceiling. These accounts also came with the requirement of a seven-day advance notice. In 1980, access to NOW Accounts was expanded nationwide. Then, in 1986 the 5% ceiling was lifted on these accounts. The removal of the ceiling led to a new iteration of the NOW Account, the Super NOW Account. Super NOW Accounts were known for offering higher rates of interest than regular NOW Accounts. Later, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act led to a repeal of Reg Q in 2011. The repeal of Reg Q fully eliminated the prohibition on interest-earning checking accounts. As a result, banks were given much broader latitude to develop interest-paying checking account offerings. Today, NOW Accounts are generally a thing of the past. Beyond the interest benefit, their main difference from demand deposit checking accounts when they were widely available was the seven-day holding period, which required customers to plan ahead for a possible seven-day advance notice. Not all banks invoked the holding period but it was the main attribute that characterized the accounts, along with their measurable interest rate. After the repeal of Req Q, checking account offerings became more widely varied. Throughout history, checking accounts have been relied on for immediate withdrawals. They are also relied on by banks for some short-term cash funding needs. In general, competition among mainstream banks is relatively low, with most banks offering little to no interest at all. Accounts that do offer the highest relative interest rates usually come with extensive requirements for balance levels, routine direct deposits, and debit card usage. Specialty checking account products can also come with cash-back offers or other simple extra features. Today, NOW Accounts aren't technically banned or discontinued, but since 2011, when Regulation Q was repealed, the prohibition on interest-earning checking accounts is gone. So banks were given much more latitude to offer interest-paying checking account offerings and didn't need to continue NOW Accounts. A NOW Account is the abbreviated name for a Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) Account, which is an interest-earning demand deposit checking account. A demand deposit account is a bank account in which the funds held can be withdrawn at any time, without giving the bank advance notice. They usually arehought of as\u00a0checking accounts, are highly liquid and offer little to no interest. A Negotiable Order of Withdrawal, or NOW, Account was a popular type of interest-earning demand deposit account before banking system reforms made by the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed in 2010 in response to the financial crisis. NOW Accounts were an interest-bearing option for liquid funds. But after the Dodd-Frank Act repealed Regulation Q, which banned paying interest on demand deposit accounts, banks have no reason to offer NOW Accounts because they can instead offer a range of interest on various checking accounts, as well as other savings instruments.

Wells Fargo offers Way2Save and Platinum Savings accounts, but their interest rates are subpar SDI Productions / Getty Images Wells Fargo offers two savings accounts: the Way2Save Savings account and the Platinum Savings account, the latter of which offers an annual percentage yield (APY) of up to 2.51% but requires a balance of $1 million or more and must be linked to a Premier Checking account for that rate. The rates on both accounts are fairly low, especially compared to the best high-yield savings accounts. Wells Fargo's savings account rates may vary by location, and the rates listed on this page may not be available in all ZIP codes. The APYs listed on this page use NYC ZIP code 10001. Wells Fargo offers mediocre APYs for its savings accounts, and you can easily find higher rates elsewhere. Browse some high-yield accounts and check offers from our partners below to find the right bank to deposit your cash. Wells Fargo\u2019s Way2Save account offers a flat APY across all balances. This rate is significantly lower than the national average savings rate of 0.45% (as of 6/17/24). This account comes with a $5 monthly service fee, though the fee will be waived if you meet one of the following criteria: The Way2Save account comes with an ATM card to access your savings. Interest is compounded daily and paid to your account monthly. Wells Fargo also allows parents to open individual and joint accounts for their children. Contact a banker for more details on opening an account for your child. The monthly fee will be waived if you maintain a $3,500 minimum daily balance each fee period. Wells Fargo\u2019s Platinum Savings account has a range of rates depending on your balance and relationship with the bank. Here\u2019s what it offers by account balance. To receive the relationship APY, you must link a Wells Fargo Prime Checking, Premier Checking, or Private Bank Interest Checking account to your Platinum Savings account. The Platinum account compounds interest daily; interest is paid out on a monthly basis. This account comes with an ATM card and also allows you to write checks, unlike the Way2Save account. Monthly fee waiver is easy to meet Large network of branches Customer service available 24/7 over the phone Interest rates are typically low Requires a minimum deposit Wells Fargo has a history of unfair fees Based in San Francisco, Wells Fargo is one of the largest banks in the U.S. Along with its two savings account options, it offers checking accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), home loans, credit cards, and other financial products. Anyone with a valid identification, Social Security number, and opening deposit can open a Wells Fargo savings account. You don\u2019t have to be an existing Wells Fargo customer to open a savings account, though you\u2019ll need a checking account if you want a Wells Fargo debit card. Wells Fargo\u2019s savings rates are low compared to many other banks. The Way2Save account earns a meager APY, below the national average and far less than the 4% or higher rates you can find on a high-yield savings account. In 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered Wells Fargo to pay more than $2 billion in redress to consumers and a $1.7 billion civil penalty for legal violations. According to the CFPB, Wells Fargo mismanaged its loans and deposit accounts via illegal overdraft penalty charges, illegal freezing of consumer accounts, and deceptive claims about the availability of fee waivers. The Fed cut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing them by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%\u20135.00% at its Sept. 18, 2024, meeting. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means savings rates will decline after reaching heights not seen in more than 20 years. Wells Fargo does not offer particularly good APYs on its savings accounts. Its Way2Save account has an APY that\u2019s usually significantly lower than the national average. While its Platinum Savings account offers better rates, you\u2019ll need at least $100,000 in your account to start earning more. You can find high-yield savings accounts at other banks with APYs of 4% or more. Wells Fargo charges a monthly service fee of $5 for its Way2Save Savings account and $12 for its Platinum Savings account. However, Way2Save account holders can get the $5 fee waived if they maintain a $300 minimum daily balance, make an automatic transfer of at least $25 from a linked Wells Fargo checking account each fee period, or meet other qualifying criteria. Platinum savers can get the $12 service fee waived if they maintain a minimum daily balance of $3,500 in their account. See our picks for the best free savings accounts for some inexpensive options with high yields. The minimum opening deposit for a Wells Fargo Way2Save or Platinum Savings account is $25. The Way2Save account has a single interest rate tier, but you\u2019ll need a higher balance to earn the best APYs with the Platinum account; the higher your balance, the higher the APY. You can open a Wells Fargo Way2Save or Platinum Savings account by filling out and submitting a short application online. You\u2019ll need to provide your Social Security number or ITIN, a valid identification, and a $25 opening deposit.

            "title": "Passbook Loan: Meaning, How it Works, Pros and Cons",
            "content": "A passbook loan is a personal loan made to a savings account holder by the custodial bank, which uses the savings account balance as collateral. These loans may also be called a savings pledged loan, and another version is called a certified pledge loan. With a passbook loan, the savings account holder continues to earn interest in the savings account, including the amount borrowed. As the loan is repaid, the account holder gains access to those funds. Terms and conditions vary considerably, with some lenders willing to lend up to the account's balance, although others only lend a percentage. For example, a passbook loan with Community Savings Bank will allow customers to borrow up to 90% of their available balance. Passbook loans are considered low-risk transactions for the lender due to the accessibility of the collateral. The borrower must hand over the passbook to the bank until the loan is repaid. The bank can also place a hold on the savings account funds up to the loan amount. Basically, a passbook loan is a loan you take out against yourself. You are borrowing from your bank or credit union using your savings account balance as collateral. A passport loan can help you if you need to establish a good track record of paying back your debts, which can help you improve your credit history. A passbook loan uses the balance of a savings account as collateral, which makes it lower risk for a lender. Another reason to use a passbook loan versus a personal loan is that you'll be offered a lower interest rate on a passbook loan by your bank or credit union. What is the interest rate on a passbook loan? It depends on the institution issuing the loan. For example, BankFive in Massachusetts and Rhode Island has an interest rate for its \"collateral loan\" product of either 3% or 3.5%. A passbook loan keeps your money (and the loan funds) in one place, which may be reassuring to a nervous borrower or saver. Plus, your savings account will still earn dividends. The downsides of a passbook loan are that If the bank doesn't report your loan history to the credit agencies, it won't be added to your credit history. If you default on the loan, you lose your savings, which are the collateral to the loan. That, in turn, could leave you without funds for an emergency or deplete your savings, which you might have been planning to use for major expense like a down payment, new car, or a holiday. Also, you will be essentially paying interest on your own money, and missing a payment will often result in late fees. Some banks or credit unions may require a $5 or more balance in your savings account in addition to the money you use for collateral. To get\u00a0a passbook loan, you need\u00a0a\u00a0funded savings account or certificate of deposit (CD) account. This account\u00a0is\u00a0usually with the institution you intend on borrowing from. The\u00a0passbook loan\u00a0amount\u00a0is\u00a0based on the balance in your savings account. A passbook loan is sometimes called a\u00a0savings pledged loan, so they are the same. Both a passbook loan and a savings pledged loan use your savings as collateral for a loan. If you don\u2019t have established credit or you have a\u00a0low credit score, a passbook loan could have some benefits. Every time you make an on-time payment for the loan, it may be reported to the credit bureaus. Over the life of the loan, consistent, timely payments could help your credit score. A passbook loan might also be an option to consider if you aren\u2019t eligible for other types of financing, or if the only other loans you qualify for have high interest rates. A passbook loan may offer a lower interest rate because your savings account balance is the collateral. Passbook loans allow you to use your savings account as collateral\u00a0for a loan. Most banks and credit unions let you borrow up to 100% of the amount in your account.\u00a0These loans may offer lower interest rates than a credit card or personal loan secured without collateral. Remember, if you take out a passbook loan, you will be essentially paying interest on your own funds.\u00a0But a passbook loan may help your credit score if your lender\u00a0reports your payments\u00a0to the credit agencies.

            "title": "Linked Savings Account: Meaning, Benefits, FAQs",
            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. A linked savings account is\u00a0a savings account that is connected to another account such as a checking or negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) account. Generally, linked savings accounts are held at the same bank as the customer's other accounts, making it easier to transfer funds between accounts. When a customer opens a linked savings account, the bank or financial institution connects it by account number to a new or existing checking or NOW account in the system. Since these accounts make it easier to transfer money, they're convenient for people who want to accumulate savings. Linked accounts are sometimes called packaged accounts. The balances on both linked accounts are generally reported on a single consolidated statement, making it easier for customers to keep track of their money. Linked savings accounts also allow customers to keep the majority of their funds in a savings account, which may earn more interest, moving money into the checking or NOW account as needed. Some packaged or linked accounts may also offer incentives such as lower fees or free checking. The balances on your savings account and any checking, NOW or other accounts to which it's linked are generally reported on a single consolidated statement. Other types of accounts, such as a certificate of deposit (CD), can also be linked to your other bank accounts. Banks may encourage you to link up multiple accounts (and continue to deposit money into those accounts) by offering special benefits such as a higher interest rate. There are instances, however, where linking accounts could lead to additional fees. For example, one benefit of linking your savings and checking account is overdraft protection. If your checking account balance goes too low, some banks will automatically transfer money from your savings account into your checking account to protect you from incurring overdraft fees. However, this service often comes with its own fee. Plus, if you trigger that sort of transfer too frequently, your savings account could fall below the minimum balance, which could cause other fees to kick in. If you find that the ideal checking and savings accounts for your needs aren't available at the same bank, you may also be able to link accounts from different banks. This can work well if you're looking to hold your extra cash in a high-yield savings account that may not be available at the bank where you do your checking. Look for an option to link external accounts. You'll need to provide more information to get this done, and transfers may take longer to go through. There are also sometimes limits on the number of external transfers you can make each month. Banks may want to incentivize linked savings accounts so that they can hold a larger share of your business for a longer amount of time. This could mean higher rates for you, especially if you're able to maintain a higher balance. Plus, having your accounts in one place\u2014with transfers available quickly and easily\u2014simplifies money management. Linked savings accounts allow customers to keep the majority of their funds in a savings account, which may earn more interest, moving money into the checking or NOW account as needed. Some packaged or linked accounts may also offer incentives such as lower fees or free checking. Linking accounts may trigger additional fees. Often, banks will automatically transfer funds from one account to the other to maintain a particular balance or when you have insufficient funds to cover a payment. Such transactions often may have fees for each instance. This practice can become especially problematic if it causes your savings account to fall below the minimum balance, which could cause other fees to kick in. Linking might also add another step if you decide to close one of the accounts or change banks. Tri Counties Bank. \"Linked Savings.\" Accessed Oct. 8, 2021.

Capital One\u2019s accounts feature higher-than-average APYs without monthly fees Marko Geber / Getty Images Although there are banks and credit unions that advertise higher yields on savings accounts, Capital One\u2019s savings accounts stand out because the bank doesn\u2019t charge monthly maintenance or account fees. Nor does Capital One require consumers to maintain a minimum balance, so it\u2019s a useful option for new savers. And Capital One\u2019s savings account interest rates are still better than the national average. Capital One is one of the 10 largest banks in the U.S., and it offers a variety of banking products, including checking and savings accounts. Capital One savings account rates may not be the highest you can find if you shop around, but the bank does not charge maintenance fees. Nor does it require a minimum balance. Compare Capital One's rates with other banks' rates on savings accounts, and keep in mind other factors like fees as you determine which may be best for you. For those looking for a simple savings account with a higher-than-average APY, the Capital One 360 Performance Savings account could be an excellent choice. It doesn\u2019t have a monthly maintenance fee, nor does it have a minimum balance requirement. Interest is compounded and credited to the account monthly. The account offers basic convenience features common among major banks, including: One standout feature that Capital One offers is the ability to create multiple savings accounts. You can use separate accounts to save for specific goals, such as designating one for your emergency fund, one for future travel expenses, and one to save for a down payment for a house. Because there is no fee to open and maintain accounts, this feature can be a convenient way to track your progress toward several goals. Like many banks, Capital One permits no more than six transfers from a savings account to a third party or another Capital One account per statement cycle. However, Capital One stated that it\u2019s currently not enforcing the transfer limit on any of its savings accounts. If that changes, the bank will notify customers. The Capital One Kids Savings Account is a parent-controlled savings option for young children. It has no minimum balance requirement or monthly fees, making it a useful starter account for kids. Children under the age of 18 are eligible for the Kids Savings Account. There is no minimum age requirement, so you can open an account for a new baby and start saving on their behalf. The account has several benefits: However, the APY on the account is relatively low. You can find other savings accounts for children that have significantly higher APYs from other banks or credit unions, but they may require a higher minimum deposit. Capital One was founded in 1994, and it offers a variety of banking and credit products, including bank accounts, credit cards, and loans. It\u2019s known for its fee-free account options, especially for checking and savings accounts. Capital One is primarily a digital bank, though it does operate some banking cafes and branches in select states. Those looking for a bank with convenient brick-and-mortar locations may find that Capital One isn\u2019t a good match for them, but Capital One does have a network of partner ATMs where you can make withdrawals. Besides its savings accounts, Capital One also offers certificates of deposit (CDs). Its CD terms are quite flexible, and CDs have higher-than-average APYs with no account minimums. Although CDs, especially from banks with the best CD rates, often have higher APYs than savings accounts, be aware that there are penalties for withdrawing money from a CD before it reaches its maturity date. With Capital One, the penalty is three to six months of interest. The Fed cut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing them by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%\u20135.00% at its Sept. 18, 2024, meeting. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation.

Capital One 360 interest rates are competitive across all balances No monthly fees or minimum deposit No limit on monthly withdrawals Low APY on Kids Savings account Few physical branch locations Easy access to savings can be tempting While Capital One offers a relatively high yield on its Performance 360 Savings account compared to many other banks, you can likely still find better rates elsewhere. Check out the best high-yield savings accounts from a variety of banks and credit unions to find the right account. A savings account is a good spot to park your extra money, but a checking account is better for regular spending and paying your bills. These accounts come with a debit card so you can spend at stores and take out cash at the ATM, and some even offer some interest. See the best high-interest checking accounts to find a good companion to your savings account. A money market account (MMA) offers a hybrid of a checking and savings account. It may come with a higher-than-average APY, as well as check-writing abilities and an ATM card. Watch out for higher fees or minimum balance requirements, though. If you don\u2019t need to access your cash for a while, you could invest it in a CD. Certificates of deposit offer a guaranteed return on your investment, but you\u2019ll pay a penalty if you withdraw your cash before the CD matures. Browse the best CD rates available today to see if one might be right for your savings strategy. To protect your savings against inflation, you could consider investing in I bonds from the U.S. government. I bonds may have better rates than CDs, but you can\u2019t withdraw your cash until a year has passed. Keep in mind that Capital One savings accounts don\u2019t come with a debit or ATM card. You\u2019ll need to open a checking account, perhaps a high-yield checking account, if you want the option of spending from the account or withdrawing cash at an ATM. Capital One\u2019s 360 Performance Savings account is a high-yield savings account, offering a much higher-than-average APY with no minimum deposit and no monthly fees. Unlike other banks that charge monthly fees and require minimum deposits of $500 or more, Capital One\u2019s savings accounts have no minimum deposit or monthly fees. Capital One is a good choice for those looking for a basic savings account to save for their goals. With the Capital One 360 Performance Savings account, interest is compounded and credited to the account on a monthly basis. Capital One has two savings accounts, the 360 Performance Savings Account and the Kids Savings Account. But Capital One also offers CDs for those who want to lock in a higher APY. Yes, you can open just a Capital One 360 Performance Savings account. To open your account you\u2019ll need to provide some personal information, such as your contact information, driver\u2019s license number, Social Security number, and date of birth. You can withdraw money from a Capital One savings account by transferring cash to another account, such as your checking account at Capital One or another bank. You can request a withdrawal from your account online, in person at one of Capital One\u2019s branches, or by calling the bank\u2019s customer service team. If you transfer money out of your Capital One Savings account to another Capital One bank account before 5 p.m. ET, the transfer will take place that day; if the transfer is made after that time, it\u2019ll be made the following day. If you\u2019re transferring the money to another bank, the transaction may take one to three business days to clear. If you transfer money to an external account right before the weekend or a federal holiday it may take longer to process, since these days are not considered business days. No, the Capital One 360 Performance Savings account doesn\u2019t come with a debit card. Capital One bank accounts that come with a debit card are the 360 Checking, MONEY Teen Checking, Total Control Checking, and Simply Checking accounts.

Citibank offers several bank account packages for different kinds of customers Lock Stock / Getty Images Citibank has several savings account options, with rates as high as 4.30%, tailored for different consumers. Each of its savings accounts comes with a relatively generous APY (compared to the national average), though fees and features vary depending on the account you choose. Here\u2019s what to know about Citibank savings account rates, options, and features and how they compare to some of the best savings account rates. Citi\u2019s terms can vary widely depending on where you live. The terms below use Texas ZIP code 73301. Citi\u2019s account packages and savings accounts may be worth exploring, especially for high-net-worth individuals, but they won\u2019t be right for everyone\u2014and their rates aren\u2019t the highest. Different banking options have different features and requirements. Some may require you to open a checking account in addition to your savings account, others may not. Citigroup, which owns Citibank, is the third-largest bank in the United States by assets. It has over 65,000 ATMs and hundreds of bank branches nationwide. Citi offers an impressive range of accounts designed for different types of customers, and all of its savings accounts come with generous rates. In addition to savings accounts, Citi also offers checking accounts, CDs, and bank IRAs. Those seeking a more long-term savings option may benefit from a Citi CD, and those interested in diversifying their investments with low-risk options may find a bank IRA is a good choice. Overall, Citi offers some decent savings options with generous rates, although you can typically find better rates for savings accounts and better rates for CDs elsewhere. Several of Citi's savings accounts come included in account packages, though, so if you don\u2019t plan to do all of your banking with Citi, another institution may offer more flexibility.

Further cuts are expected, which means savings rates will decline after reaching heights not seen in more than 20 years. No minimum balance to earn highest APY Competitive APYs Large ATM and branch network Different rates in different areas of the country Monthly fees may apply Rates may not be higher for high-tier accounts Rates may vary depending on where you live If Citibank doesn\u2019t offer the account options you need, several alternatives exist with other financial institutions. Consider looking into the following: Online banks typically have lower overhead costs than brick-and-mortar institutions. As a result, they can often afford to offer higher savings rates for account holders. Citibank compounds interest on its savings accounts daily, and total interest earnings are paid out monthly. There are minimum combined balance requirements for certain Citibank account packages (which include savings accounts), but not others. For instance, you\u2019ll need to maintain an average monthly balance of $200,000 across your deposit, retirement, and investment accounts to qualify for a Citigold Account, or $1,000,000 for a Citigold Private Client Account. But other account packages, like the Citibank Account Package, the Basic Account Package, and the Access Account Package, do not come with minimum balance requirements. Yes, it\u2019s possible to open a savings account at Citibank without opening a checking account\u2014but some account packages require you to open a checking account to qualify. The Citibank Account, Basic Banking, and Access Account Packages don\u2019t require you to open a checking account. The Citigold, Citigold Private Client, and Citi Priority Accounts do require you to open a checking account. Yes, Citibank offers a savings account with a higher-than-average APY. If you\u2019re looking to earn a higher rate than you\u2019d get with a traditional savings account, a high-yield savings account with Citi could be a decent option. But Citi doesn\u2019t offer the highest rates available\u2014see the best high-yield savings accounts to find the best home for your money. Citibank offers accounts with no monthly fees along with accounts with monthly fees as high as $30. The fee structure depends on the account or account package you choose. It\u2019s possible to have your monthly maintenance fees waived if you meet certain criteria, such as maintaining a specific minimum balance across eligible Citi accounts or making a qualifying direct deposit or bill payment. Citibank offers generous rates in some areas of the U.S., and may be good for savings depending on your individual situation and needs. If you\u2019re looking for an all-in-one banking solution and can meet the criteria to waive the monthly maintenance fees, an account package from Citi may be a decent choice. But you can likely find higher APYs elsewhere for savings accounts, CDs, and MMAs.

Fidelity\u2019s Cash Management Account has few fees, but mediocre rates vorDa / Getty Images At just 2.35% APY, the Fidelity Cash Management Account doesn\u2019t provide anywhere near the highest interest rates available on savings accounts. Yet at the time of publication, interest rates on the Fidelity Cash Management Account are many times higher than the national average APY for savings accounts and several dozen times higher than the national average APY for checking accounts. The account features no minimum balance requirements, no monthly maintenance fees, free checks, and free ATM access. Fidelity Investments, commonly referred to as Fidelity, is a top choice when you\u2019re looking for a low-cost online broker. The same company also offers other financial services to its customers, including the Fidelity Cash Management Account, which shares many features of both savings and checking accounts. In fact, you can use this flexible account to spend, save, or invest your cash. Fidelity\u2019s Cash Management Account outperforms the average national APYs for both savings and checking accounts. The account also exceeds the national average APYs for money market accounts and CDs. However, you can find higher interest rates by shopping around. Compare what Fidelity offers with its Cash Management Account to the rates on these other accounts from our partners. While the interest rates you can earn on your savings matter, it\u2019s important to look beyond the APYs on your cash deposits and consider the other features a deposit account offers. Interest rates on the Fidelity Cash Management Account are above average, but they\u2019re usually not the highest APYs you can find. Yet the account does come with other notable features that could make it a good fit for individuals who are looking for an alternative to a traditional checking or savings account. One convenient aspect is the fact that there are no minimum deposit requirements to meet. You don\u2019t have to worry about paying any monthly fees to maintain your account, either. Customers get free online bill pay and free unlimited check writing, as well mobile check deposit capabilities. Another big perk of using the Fidelity Cash Management Account comes in the form of global ATM fee reimbursement. If you use a Fidelity debit card at an eligible ATM (any ATM with the Visa, Plus, or Star logo) to withdraw cash, Fidelity will credit your account for all ATM fees deducted from your account. In most cases, fee reimbursement happens the same day. The account offers you the flexibility to invest, save, or spend your money. Any uninvested cash balance you keep in your Fidelity Cash Management Account is eligible for insurance coverage through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will insure your deposits for up to $250,000 (per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per account ownership category) if you bank with a financial institution that\u2019s a member of the FDIC. Keep in mind that the Fidelity Cash Management Account is technically not a bank account but a brokerage account. However, the company works with partner banks to create Fidelity\u2019s FDIC Insured Deposit Sweep Program. Through the deposit sweep program, Fidelity will distribute the uninvested cash balance from your Fidelity Cash Management Account into different bank accounts\u2014up to $245,000 per account\u2014to make sure you stay below FDIC insurance limits. You could enjoy up to $5 million worth of FDIC insurance through your cash management account, assuming the partner banks in Fidelity\u2019s deposit sweep program have available capacity. Fidelity Investments is not a bank but an online broker that serves over 43 million customers. In addition to its online trading platform, the Boston-based company also offers financial planning services and wealth management advice through human advisors, in addition to offering a robo-advisor service. The Fidelity investment platform doesn\u2019t offer many traditional deposit accounts, like savings or money market accounts, but you can work with Fidelity to open other types of investment accounts: Customers that use Fidelity have access to mutual funds, options, currencies, and a variety of fixed-income products like bonds (e.g., treasury bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds) and CDs. Investors can also take advantage of their robo-advisor, Fidelity Go, by opening an account, and accessing it on Fidelity\u2019s website or mobile app. Earn returns on your cash ATM reimbursement No minimum withdrawal limit Lower returns than alternatives Daily spending limits You can use Fidelity cash management account to earn returns on your cash, but other options can potentially earn higher returns while providing FDIC protection that minimizes risk. Alternatives include high-yield savings accounts and checking accounts, CDs, and money market accounts. Fidelity doesn\u2019t offer its customers traditional deposit accounts like savings accounts\u2014high-yield or otherwise. However, Fidelity partners with several banks to make its Cash Management Account available to customers who want an account to meet basic banking needs and earn interest on their cash savings at the same time. Its APYs, unfortunately, don\u2019t usually stack up to the best high-yield savings accounts available now. There are no minimum deposit requirements you must meet to open a Fidelity Cash Management Account. Similarly, there are no monthly balance requirements to avoid fees, as the account doesn't charge any monthly fees. In most cases, you can open a Fidelity Cash Management Account by completing an online application. You can open both a Fidelity Cash Management Account and a Fidelity brokerage account in a single online session, if you\u2019d like. If your cash management account features any special trust registrations, however, the process is slightly different. Accounts with trust registrations require you to download, print, and complete a PDF application form. Interest accrues daily on the Cash Management Account, and Fidelity pays customers interest on the last business day of the month (for balances swept into partner banks through the Deposit Sweep Program). Keep in mind that if you opt to invest the money in your Fidelity Cash Management Account, it\u2019s not eligible to earn interest.

Her work has been published on major financial websites including Bankrate, Fox Business, Credit Karma, The Simple Dollar, and more. shapecharge / Getty Images With a high-yield savings account like the Ally Bank Savings Account, which offers 4.0% APY, you\u2019ll be able to earn interest on your savings while knowing your money is safe. Ally Bank has one of the most popular savings accounts on the market, thanks to its high interest rates, its buckets feature, and more. A savings account can be a great way to set aside money for a rainy day or to save for your financial goals. Learn how Ally Bank Savings Account compares to other savings accounts, including high-yield savings accounts. Ally Bank offers attractive rates on its high-yield savings account and some of its CDs. Compare Ally\u2019s rates with some other savings accounts and find the one that\u2019s best for you. The Ally Bank Savings Account has several features that make it popular with consumers. First, while Ally doesn\u2019t have the highest APY on the market, it\u2019s certainly a competitive rate. There is no minimum deposit, no monthly minimum balance, and no monthly fees. Like other savings accounts, there are some limitations with Ally\u2019s. For example, Ally only permits up to six monthly withdrawals from certain types of accounts, including savings accounts. Be careful not to exceed the six maximum withdrawals per month accidentally. You\u2019ll be stuck with a $10 fee for each transaction above the allowed number. One interesting feature of the Ally Bank Savings Account is its \u201cbuckets'' feature. With it you can create several digital envelopes, known as buckets, to organize your money and track progress toward savings goals. Another Ally Bank savings account feature\u2014\u201cboosters\u201d\u2014lets you automate your savings in a few ways: Offers bucket features Offers booster features Available in all states Competitive rates May find higher yields elsewhere Limit to six withdrawals per month Ally Bank is an online bank that\u2019s available to all U.S. citizens and permanent residents in the country, regardless of what state you\u2019re in. Its parent company, Ally Financial, offers a variety of financial products, including deposit accounts, credit cards, brokerage and retirement accounts, mortgages, auto loans, and personal loans. As far as savings products, Ally Bank has several options to choose from: Ally Bank is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\u2014the FDIC\u2014which means that money in deposit accounts is backed by the agency. FDIC insurance covers up to $250,000 per account holder per ownership category at each bank. Ownership categories include single account, joint account, trust accounts, and similar. Because the limit is based on ownership category, you could have accounts with $250,000 in multiple categories and have them all covered. However, if you have $250,000 in a single savings account and $250,000 in a checking account at the same bank, only half of your deposits would be covered. Ally Bank can be an excellent bank for savings. It has a competitive APY. It also has the popular buckets feature, which allows you to visually divide your money within the account. Finally, if you also have a checking account with Ally, there are several creative ways to boost your savings. However, Ally doesn\u2019t have the highest APY of any high-yield savings account. So if your goal is to earn the highest interest possible, Ally may not be the right choice. Ally Bank typically pays a competitive rate on its high-yield savings accounts, although it's not usually the best available. You could also earn an even greater return on a Ally Bank money market account or Ally Bank CD. Ally Bank doesn\u2019t charge many of the banking fees that other competitors do, including monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, ACH transfer fees, incoming wire fees, or cashier\u2019s check fees. It does charge some fees but is very transparent about them.

TD Bank offers the potential for high rates, but savers need to maintain a high balance ArtistGNDphotography / Getty Images TD Bank\u2019s savings accounts tend to be best for existing TD Bank customers with substantial savings who can qualify for the higher annual percentage yields (APYs) of up to 4%. Otherwise, the rates are below average, so you can likely find an account with a higher APY elsewhere. TD Bank's savings account rates may vary by location, and the rates listed below may not be available in all ZIP codes. The APYs listed below use New York City as the region and are up to date as of the date of publication of this article. We review rates every two weeks and update the information below accordingly. TD Bank\u2019s rates are attractive for some balance ranges, but the best APYs will be out of reach for most people. Compare TD Bank to some other high-yield accounts below to find the right savings option for you. As the name implies, the TD Simple Savings account is a basic, barebones savings account. There\u2019s no minimum deposit to open an account, so it\u2019s useful for those who are new to saving. There is a monthly maintenance fee, but there are several ways you can have that fee waived: The account does earn interest, and interest is compounded monthly. However, the APY on the TD Simple Savings account is quite low. In fact, it\u2019s significantly lower than the national average (0.46%, as of October 16, 2023), so you can likely find a bank with a high-yield savings account that offers APYs several times higher. You should also be aware that you are limited to six pre-authorized withdrawals or transfers per month. If you make additional transfers, TD Bank will charge you $9 per transaction. The TD Signature Savings account is a high-yield savings account for those who have a substantial amount of money. Interest on the account is compounded monthly. The Signature Savings account without a relationship rate has a lower-than-average APY until you have $250,000 or more in the account. You can qualify for a relationship rate bump if you are a TD Bank customer with a connected checking account or credit card. The relationship rate bump offers a much higher APY on balances of $10,000 or more, but you\u2019ll still need to save $100,000 before you\u2019ll qualify for the best possible APY. The TD Signature Savings account has a $15 monthly maintenance fee, which can be waived in the following ways: Monthly fee waiver option No minimum deposit requirement to open Current TD Bank customers can qualify for relationship rate bump Interest rates are not very competitive Large balance required to access highest APY Fees for going over six withdrawals per month TD Bank allows you to open a new savings account online. And if you are an existing TD Bank customer and link an eligible checking or credit account, you can qualify for a relationship interest rate boost. Despite only being available in a few states, TD Bank is the 10th largest bank in the country. It offers a variety of financial products, including credit cards, personal loans, mortgages, and savings and checking accounts. Only residents of certain states can open a TD Bank savings account. TD Bank only operates in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Besides its savings accounts, TD Bank also offers certificates of deposit (CDs). Existing TD Bank customers can qualify for a CD with a much higher-than-average APY, but the highest APYs are only available on some CD terms. TD Bank has other options in addition to standard CDs, including those that allow for a penalty-free withdrawal. TD Bank occasionally has special offers for its deposit accounts, including savings accounts and CDs, allowing you to earn a bonus for opening a new account and completing certain activities. TD Bank only operates brick-and-mortar branches in select states. You can find a branch near you with its store locator tool. The Fed cut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing them by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%\u20135.00% at its Sept. 18, 2024, meeting. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means savings rates will decline after reaching heights not seen in more than 20 years. If you have a significant amount of money in savings, opening a TD Bank savings account could allow you to earn a higher-than-average APY. But if you have less than $250,000, you can likely find banks with much lower minimum thresholds, higher APYs, and no monthly fees. No, TD Bank\u2019s savings accounts aren\u2019t \u201cfree\u201d because they have monthly fees: $5 for Simple Savings, $15 for Signature Savings. These fees can be waived in several ways, such as by maintaining a certain minimum daily balance or linking an eligible TD Checking account. There is no minimum balance to open a TD Bank savings account. However, you may need to deposit quite a lot of money to earn the highest possible APY. You can open a TD Bank savings account online, over the phone, or by visiting a branch. You\u2019ll need to provide your Social Security number and address, and link an existing bank to transfer money. TD Bank\u2019s savings accounts have monthly maintenance fees. However, you can waive those fees if you meet minimum balance requirements or other requirements. For example, those under 18 and over 62 can qualify for a free TD Simple Savings account.

SoFi offers its customers a hybrid savings and checking account with above-average interest rates SoFi savings account interest rates are competitive, reaching as high as 4.20%\u2014potentially beating the national average several times over if you set up an eligible direct deposit with the financial institution. The nationally chartered bank also offers a bonus of $50 to $300 for eligible new account holders. Additionally, the SoFi Checking and Savings account features no standard bank account fees, including monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, or ATM fees. Unlike some other banks, you don\u2019t have to jump through hoops to qualify for fee waivers from SoFi.\u00a0Learn how SoFi's savings account compares to other savings accounts, including high-yield savings accounts. Before opening a savings account, it\u2019s wise to compare the rates a financial institution offers with both the national average rates and the APYs from multiple competing banks and credit unions. The interest rates for savings accounts from SoFi rank well above the national average. Nonetheless, it\u2019s important to point out that you can typically find higher interest rates with a little research, including savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and money market accounts. Here are other rates from our partner financial institutions that you can compare to SoFi's savings account rate. SoFi\u2019s savings account must be opened along with a SoFi checking account. You can\u2019t have a SoFi savings account on its own or a SoFi checking account on its own. The checking account earns a modest APY as well. To qualify for the highest APY on your SoFi savings account balance, you\u2019ll need to receive direct deposits from an employer, payroll provider, or benefits provider via ACH deposit. Also you can earn the highest APY with monthly qualifying deposits. Unlike many other banks, SoFi has no withdrawal limits on its savings account. Before you open a savings account, it\u2019s important to consider the features of the account\u2014from the APY a bank offers and beyond. Here are some of the highlights that might help you decide whether a SoFi Checking and Savings account makes sense for you. Excellent rate No ongoing fees Full-service financial firm Automatic savings program Access to member benefits program $4.95 fee for depositing cash Doesn\u2019t offer in-person branches Must sign up for SoFi checking account too Rate and benefits depend on deposit activity Make sure you can meet SoFi\u2019s deposit requirements to earn the highest APY, especially if you\u2019re a freelance worker or contractor who isn\u2019t paid via direct deposits. Otherwise, this account may not be worth the hassle. The history of SoFi began in 2011 when four Stanford business school students came together to launch an alumni-funded lending program. As SoFi grew, it expanded the financial services it offered consumers. On top of a wide variety of loan products, SoFi customers now have access to automated investing services, active investing, credit cards, insurance products, and limited banking services. However, aside from the hybrid SoFi Checking and Savings account, the financial institution doesn\u2019t offer additional savings options. In fact, SoFi doesn\u2019t offer any other types of deposit accounts. If SoFi isn\u2019t right for you, consider these other savings options: SoFi has a high-interest savings account with a fairly good rate, which comes with a checking account. But it\u2019s possible to find still higher APYs\u2014browse the best high-yield savings accounts to find the best rates available today. There is no minimum account balance requirement to open a SoFi savings account and checking account. Likewise, you don\u2019t need to maintain a minimum balance to qualify for a bank fee waiver or to qualify for a bank account bonus from SoFi. There are no account fees, and you can earn a bonus by setting up direct deposits. You will accrue interest on your SoFi Checking and Savings account balance daily. The bank will compound the interest you earn on a monthly basis. SoFi calculates interest on the last business day of each month and posts it to your account by the fifth business day of the following month. SoFi offers a hybrid checking and savings account option to its customers. You must sign up for both accounts together if you want to open a savings account with the financial institution. You must open a SoFi savings account with a checking account as a two-part package; they aren\u2019t available separately. You can qualify for higher SoFi savings account interest rates and more benefits (including higher checking account rates) if you receive direct deposit payments to your checking account or you receive at least $5,000 in deposits each month via other routes. You can open a SoFi savings and checking account online if you\u2019re at least 18 years old and a U.S. citizen, a permanent resident, or a non-resident with a Social Security number. Generally, no\u2014SoFi does not charge any common bank fees for its checking/savings account package. You may pay a $4.95 fee, however, if you deposit cash into your SoFi account with one of its partner merchant retailers available around the country. Yes, SoFi is a safe place to keep your savings. SoFi checking and savings accounts are FDIC-insured up to $250,000, as is standard with other banks. SoFi offers good online banking security measures as well, such as two-factor authentication.

Discover offers a relatively accessible savings account, but the APY is low compared to top high-yield savings options MoMo Productions / Getty Images Discover offers a high-yield savings account that comes with a 4.00% annual percentage yield (APY), which is much higher than the national average. The interest rate applies regardless of your balance, so you don't have to worry about complicated APY tiers. Discover's savings account rates can help you earn money on your cash with returns that are greater than you can find at many other financial institutions. However, by shopping around, you may be able to get even more returns on other savings accounts, including on high-yield savings accounts. The Discover Online Savings account is easy to open, with no minimum deposit or balance requirement. You'll also earn the same APY regardless of your balance. Interest is compounded daily and paid monthly. Although the bank's APY is high compared to the national average (0.45%, as of October 2024), it\u2019s low compared to the best high-yield savings accounts on the market. Discover doesn't charge any account fees, though, so you don't have to worry about extra costs. Like many other savings accounts, this one has a limit of six withdrawals per statement cycle, and while Discover won't charge you a fee for excessive withdrawals beyond that threshold, it may refuse to complete the transaction.

Savings account interest rates can fluctuate regularly, so while one bank may offer the best APY at the moment, there's no guarantee it will stay that way as banks compete for consumers' business. While a high APY is important, consider all account features to determine the best fit for you. Unless you already bank with Discover, it might be worth checking out other alternatives to ensure you get the right account for your financial situation. You cannot redeem I Bonds in the first year, and if you cash them in during the first five years, you'll forfeit the previous three months' worth of interest. Discover offers a high yield on its savings account, but if you're looking to maximize your return on your short-term savings needs (like for an emergency fund or home down payment), you can find better APYs elsewhere. Take a look at the best high-yield savings accounts to see the highest rates on the market today. Discover doesn't have a minimum balance requirement to open a savings account or to earn interest. With some other banks, you may need to make a minimum deposit to get started or maintain a certain balance to earn the account's highest interest rate, which makes Discover relatively accessible. You can withdraw money from your Discover Online Savings account through a bank transfer (either to a Discover checking account or to an external account), a wire transfer, or a bank check. The account doesn't come with an ATM or bank card, so there's no way to withdraw cash. Remember that there's a limit of six withdrawals per statement cycle. If you make more than that, the bank may decline your request. Yes, Discover offers FDIC insurance up to the maximum limit of $250,000 per account category, per owner. In other words, you're insured up to $250,000 on your own or $500,000 with a joint account owner. Discover's savings account is an online savings account. You can make deposits via bank transfers, mobile check deposits, mailed checks, and direct deposit, and you can withdraw money through bank transfers, wire transfers, or an official bank check. However, you cannot access your money at a bank branch, and there's also no ATM access unless you have a Discover checking account\u2014and you'd need to transfer money from savings to checking before your ATM withdrawal. Discover doesn't have a minimum balance requirement. To determine how much to save, think about your goals and what you want to accomplish with your short-term savings, and look at how much you can expect to earn at different rates and deposit amounts.

Jay Yuno / Getty Images American Express offers one savings account option\u2014its High-Yield Savings Account, which offers a 4.00% annual percentage yield (APY). Along with this competitive interest rate, it has no minimum deposit, no minimum balance, and no monthly fees. Learn how American Express Savings account compares to some of the best high-yield savings accounts. American Express offers attractive rates on its high-yield savings account and some of its certificate of deposits (CDs). Compare Amex\u2019s rate with some other savings accounts and find the one that\u2019s best for you. American Express\u2019s savings account APY is nearly 10 times higher than the national average rate of 0.45%. And while it has a lower rate than several other major high-yield savings accounts on the market, it's still a competitive rate that can earn account holders a decent return on their savings. American Express doesn\u2019t require a minimum deposit to open an account, nor does it require a minimum monthly balance. There is no monthly fee, regardless of your balance and whether you make regular deposits. Competitive interest rate Other services offered No minimum deposit requirement Potentially better interest rates elsewhere No retail locations American Express is a major financial institution that offers credit cards, savings accounts, checking accounts, and personal loans. While the company is probably most well known for its credit cards, its savings accounts have become increasingly popular as well. American Express also offers business financial services, including small business credit cards, business checking accounts, business lines of credit, and payment solutions. In addition to its high-yield savings account, American Express also offers another way to earn interest on your savings: certificates of deposit (CDs). You can earn between 3.00% and 4.50% on a CD with a term of your choice, up to five years. You\u2019re able to lock in your rate for the entire term, so if rates decrease during your CD term, you\u2019ll still earn the same interest rate as when you opened it. The table below shows the rates for each CD term: American Express doesn\u2019t have a minimum deposit requirement, so you can open an account without depositing any money. However, you won\u2019t start earning interest until you deposit money into your account. The American Express High Yield Savings Account is an interest-bearing account, which means the bank pays you a certain percentage on the money you have in the account. This interest compounds daily and is deposited monthly\u2014each day the interest you earn is added to your total balance and also begins to earn interest. The more money you have in the account and the longer you have it there, the more interest you\u2019ll earn. Opening a savings account doesn\u2019t affect your credit score. However, if you rack up any banking fees that you fail to pay, American Express could report them to the credit bureaus, which would have a negative impact on your credit score. Yes, it\u2019s safe to open an American Express savings account. First, the bank uses plenty of security features on its website, including multi-factor authentication, SSL encryption, and others. Additionally, funds in American Express bank accounts are FDIC-insured, which means that if American Express goes bankrupt or out of business, your deposits are protected up to $250,000 for each ownership category.

The top savings account bonus is currently provided by PNC Bank, with a bonus of $400.\u00a0Meet the direct deposit qualification of $5,000, and you can earn a tidy sum just by depositing money with the bank. Earning interest isn\u2019t the only way you can put your savings to work. You may be able to earn far more in a shorter period of time by taking advantage of the best savings account bonuses from popular banks, which can provide hundreds of dollars for opening a new account and meeting requirements. But it's worth noting that savings account bonuses tend to be relatively uncommon, and they tend to have much steeper requirements than checking account bonuses. Investopedia tracks checking and savings account promotions from 23 banks. We chose the best savings account bonuses below based on bonus amounts, bonus requirements, and account details and restrictions, like fees and state eligibility. We only feature savings account bonus offers of at least $100, with a return on deposit of at least 2%. Many of the best savings bonuses are offered on accounts that earn rock-bottom interest rates. Check for any early account closing fees or requirements, but generally, once you earn the bonus, you\u2019re free to move on to greener pastures and close the account. Aside from the money you need to deposit to earn a bonus, consider keeping the rest of your savings in a high-yield savings account to grow it more quickly. Only residents of select regions within PNC's service area are eligible for this bonus. This bonus is available to residents of ZIP code 10001, among others. This bank may also offer other promotions; learn more in our PNC Bank Review. SoFi The bonus is available to both new and existing members without a history of direct deposit into a SoFi checking or savings account. You must be 18 or older to open an account through SoFi.

Savings account bonuses are especially tempting because they offer a chance to earn several hundred dollars, all for doing what you\u2019re already doing: letting your money sit in a safe, FDIC-insured account. Before you sign up for any offers, however, make sure you\u2019re able to meet the requirements. Banks are constantly phasing account bonuses in and out, so if you don\u2019t qualify today, keep checking around because you may see an offer you can use sooner than you think. Account bonuses are generally taxed as income, similar to earning interest. In fact, you\u2019ll generally receive a Form 1099 from the bank at the end of the year when you do your taxes. Even if you don\u2019t receive this form, you can declare the bonus as additional income on Form 1040 Schedule 1 or in your tax software. These savings account bonuses didn\u2019t make our best list but they may be worth exploring, especially if you were considering opening an account at one of the banks below. \"It's important to open an account that allows you to maintain flexibility and liquidity,\" said Brenton Harrison, a member of Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council. \"Certain accounts have high minimums, and may restrict the number of withdrawals and transfers out of the account on a monthly basis.\" Learn how to find and evaluate account bonuses, and how to switch bank accounts if necessary. Savings account bonuses may take some time to find, so expect to do your research if you\u2019d like to find these promotions. Here are some good places to start: For a wider selection of bonus offers, see our picks for the best bank account bonuses. Consider the following if you\u2019re looking for a juicy savings account promotion: Some banks require that you make large initial deposits or maintain a high balance to earn an account bonus. Read the fine print to ensure you can meet the qualifying requirements before opening a new account. Cash bonuses for opening accounts can be valuable, but having a long-term savings plan is important for financial stability. Part of that plan should include savings that earn a high annual percentage yield. It's wise to look beyond one-off promotions to the amount of interest you can earn on an ongoing basis. Our rankings of the best high-yield savings, best money market accounts, and best certificates of deposit (CDs) include options that pay you more than 10 times the average rate, so it pays to shop around. In the News: The Fed\u00a0cut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing them by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%\u20135.00% at its Sept. 18 meeting. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means deposit account rates will decline. Interest rate hikes can directly impact the rate you receive on your savings account. It's wise to see if your bank offers a high-yield savings account. You could also see if it offers one of the best CD rates right now. Combined, these accounts could help you earn the maximum amount of money on the cash you keep at your financial institution. While switching banks can seem challenging, it\u2019s actually pretty simple. Typically, the process just involves opening a new account at another financial institution, making a minimum deposit into that account\u2014ideally one large enough to qualify for any bank promotions\u2014and setting up automatic deposits to your new account. If you\u2019re paying bills from your old bank account, you may want to consider switching any automatic payments as well, depending on your total balance and if you\u2019d like to keep using that account in the future. You may need to switch your automatic credit card payments, utility payments, and more. If you use PayPal, Cash App, Venmo, or any other payment platforms, ensure the correct bank account information is included there as well. Simple requirements Limit spending risk Try out a new bank Can earn a lot of cash Must pay taxes May require large deposits Only available for new customers Can be confusing to manage multiple accounts It\u2019s best to use a budgeting app or another financial management tool to keep tabs on all of your accounts if you have them scattered across multiple banks. Savings account bonuses can be a good way to earn extra money with minimal input on your part, but they\u2019re not your only option. Here are some other ways to earn extra money: Whether you should switch banks to claim a savings account promotion depends on your individual situation. In general, though, it could be a good idea if you\u2019re able to qualify for the promotion. Savings account bonuses are generally taxable. After you\u2019ve earned a bonus, the issuing bank will typically send you a 1099-INT, 1099-MISC, or 1042-S form at tax time. You\u2019ll then report the bonus amount on your tax return. Many savings account bonuses provide an opportunity to earn $100 or more without too much effort. You can simply open an account, deposit a certain amount, or maintain a certain balance. They can be a good deal, assuming you can meet the requirements to earn the bonus. Keep in mind these bonuses will likely need to be reported on your tax return. Several banks offer savings account bonuses. Banks like SoFi, PNC, Axos, Discover, and Chase may offer promotions for new customers, although they don't always have active offers. Other bonuses, including checking account bonuses, are often available as well. Among regional and national banks we track, there are currently no banks paying $500 to open a savings account. Savings account bonuses are relatively rare compared to checking account bonuses, but you can find some options above from PNC and SoFi. 7% APY would be a pretty incredible find on a savings account, but you may find a rate like that from a niche bank or promotional offer. See our ranking of the top high-yield savings accounts for today's best rates from nationally-available banks and credit unions. The very best accounts don't usually have bonus offers, however. Investopedia tracks bonuses from Alliant Credit Union, Associated Bank, Axos Bank, Bank of America, Barclays Bank, Bask Bank, Bluevine, BMO Bank, Capital One, Chase Bank, Citibank, Citizens Bank, Discover Bank, Fifth Third Bank, Huntington Bank, KeyBank, M&T Bank, PNC Bank, Regions Bank, SoFi, TD Bank, Truist Bank, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo. Investopedia is dedicated to providing consumers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews. To rate savings account promotions, we collected nearly 200 data points for over a dozen accounts, including bonus amounts, APYs, fees, and account requirements, to ensure that our reviews help users make informed decisions about their banking needs. To be included in our best list, a savings account bonus must meet a minimum threshold of at least $100, with a return on deposit of at least 2%. New and existing Checking and Savings members who have not previously enrolled in Direct Deposit with SoFi are eligible to earn a cash bonus when they set up Direct Deposit of at least $1,000 during the Direct Deposit Bonus Period. Cash bonus will be based on the total amount of Direct Deposit. Direct Deposit Promotion begins on 12/7/2023 and will be available through 12/31/24. Full terms at\u00a0sofi.com/banking.

            "content": "MilosStankovic / Getty Images A Christmas club, also called a holiday club account, is a type of savings account in which people make routine deposits throughout the year. The accumulated savings are then withdrawn before the holiday season to provide funds for holiday shopping and other expenses, like travel. The point of a Christmas club account is to automate savings throughout the year in advance of the holiday season. Participants can choose to have the deposited funds deducted from their paychecks automatically. In many cases, the money is transferred into a customer's other account, such as a checking or savings account, on Nov. 1 of each year. These accounts help participants avoid the financial stress associated with holiday shopping and other related expenses like travel. Saving this money throughout the year can keep people from going into credit card debt to pay for gifts. It can also help enforce a holiday budget. Similar bank accounts are available to help save for other goals, such as funding a vacation. These so-called \"vacation club accounts\" allow savers to direct deposit a portion of their paycheck each month into the account. Many of these accounts release the funds in the spring or early summer, in time for summer vacations. If you withdraw funds from a Christmas club account early, some banks and credit unions will charge a penalty and you also could lose any interest earned.\ufeff\ufeff Although the branding and incentives of Christmas club\u2014and similar\u2014accounts may help savers stay motivated to achieve their goals and avoid debt, the accounts themselves typically do not pay particularly high interest. In many cases, other types of savings accounts may help people save more efficiently and earn higher interest. For this reason, customers should be careful to explore their alternatives before committing to a Christmas club or vacation club account. The first Christmas club may have been launched by the Carlisle Trust Company in 1909. The then-treasurer of the company, Merkel Landis, launched the club with roughly 350 members who contributed an average of $28 each. These accounts were popular in the 1960s and 1970s, but have become less common in recent years. Today, they are more commonly offered through smaller local credit unions and community banks. A modern example is the Christmas Club offered by CDC Federal Credit Union in Atlanta. It is available to customers with initial contributions as low as $25. The account allows participants to allocate a portion of each paycheck, with the balance distributed back to them on Nov. 1. The account has no fees, provided that the user does not withdraw funds prior to Nov. 1. A Christmas club account will help a consumer save for the holiday spending crunch by automating deposits into the account throughout the year. Saving over the year can keep people from going into credit card debt to pay for gifts and help enforce a holiday budget.

ArtistGNDphotography / Getty Images Apple Bank\u2014not to be confused with Apple the lifestyle technology company\u2014offers a variety of savings accounts so that you can find one that meets your needs. Each account differs when it comes to its minimum balance requirements, interest rates, and the amount of money you\u2019ll need to earn interest. You can earn up to 4.3% or up to 6.0% on youth accounts. Learn how these savings accounts compare with some of the best savings accounts. Apple Bank does offer a return on its savings accounts that can top many other rates, but by comparing your options you can find the best savings account to meet your needs. Apple Bank\u2019s Premium Savings only allows you to start earning interest once you have $5,000 in your account (which is also the minimum amount required to open an account and to avoid the monthly fee). With an annual percentage yield (APY) of 1.65%, the Premium Savings rate is lower than many of the top high-yield savings accounts on the market. Unlike most of Apple Bank\u2019s savings accounts, the Simple Savings account doesn\u2019t have a minimum deposit requirement or a monthly maintenance fee. You can also start earning interest with just $1 in your account, unlike some of the bank\u2019s other accounts that require thousands of dollars before you can earn. Additionally, the Simple Savings account has the highest APY of any account other than the Youth Savings. You\u2019ll also get an Apple Bank Visa debit card to go with your account, even if you don\u2019t have a linked checking account. The Super Savings account is similar to the Premium Savings in almost every way, including its $5,000 minimum deposit, minimum to earn interest, and minimum to avoid the monthly fee. The major difference between these accounts is that while the Premium Savings account offers 1.65% APY, this Super Savings account only offers 0.25%. Apple Bank\u2019s Youth Savings account is unique because it\u2019s only available for account holders ages 6 through 17. There\u2019s only a $1 minimum to open the account and $1.01 to earn interest, and there\u2019s no minimum fee on the account. This account offers the highest APY of any Apple Bank Savings account. However, you\u2019ll only earn the maximum APY on the first $10,000 in your account. Balances above $10,000 and up to $20,000 earn 2.87% APY. Balances above $20,000 do not earn interest. And for kids ages 14 through 17, the account can be accompanied by an Apple Bank Visa debit card. The BONUS Savings account is Apple Bank\u2019s account with the lowest APY. You won\u2019t earn interest on your account until you have a balance of $2,500, and once you do, you\u2019ll only earn 0.05%. You\u2019ll also need $2,500 to open your account and a running balance of $2,500 to avoid the $10 monthly maintenance fee.

And while the bank offers online services, you must schedule an appointment at a branch to open an account. In addition to the savings accounts noted above, Apple Bank also offers several other savings options, including other savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit. The minimum deposit and balance for an Apple Bank savings account depends on the account you choose. Minimum requirements range from $0 to $5,000 to open the account, earn interest, and avoid the monthly fee. The Simple Savings account is the only adult savings account that doesn\u2019t have a minimum deposit requirement. Most of the Apple Bank savings accounts don\u2019t have competitive interest rates. The Youth Savings account is the only option that has an APY that\u2019s competitive with other top high-yield savings accounts. However, this account is only available to account holders age 17 or younger. Yes, most Apple Bank savings accounts charge a monthly fee. You\u2019ll pay $8 per month for the Premium Savings or Super Savings and $10 per month for the BONUS Savings. You can avoid these fees by maintaining a certain balance. Additionally, the Simple Savings and Youth Savings accounts don\u2019t charge monthly fees. As of January 2023, Apple Bank has $17 billion in assets, $15 billion of which are deposits in its 84 different branches. Its assets make it the largest state-chartered savings bank in New York.

She has a bachelor's and a master's degree in wildlife biology and conservation from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Ridvan_celik / Getty Images Goldman Sachs offers a surprisingly good high-yield online savings account with its Marcus Savings Account, currently offering a 4.10% annual percentage yield (APY). It can be a good option for keeping your savings away from your everyday bank to earn a higher rate. We\u2019ll cover what you need to know about this account, but take the time to check rates on the best high-yield savings accounts to make sure you get the best deal. Marcus provides a simple savings account with a decent rate, but you may be able to earn more elsewhere. See a selection of other accounts from our partners below, but take note of the minimum deposit requirements. Marcus by Goldman Sachs\u2019s high-yield online savings account is about as good of a savings account as you\u2019d hope to see from any bank. Even for an online bank, it has very few limitations and red tape. There are no fees for anything\u2014even wire transfers, which most banks charge for. (You\u2019re limited to sending wire transfers only to other accounts that you own, however, rather than third-party accounts.) There are no withdrawal limitations either, nor any minimum balances you\u2019ll need to keep. You can even open an account with $0, as long as you deposit something\u2014even just a penny\u2014within the first 60 days. (If you don\u2019t, the bank will close your account.) The real selling point, however, is the high interest rate. There are no tiers or minimum balance levels to worry about\u2014you\u2019ll earn the same amount of interest on your entire balance, no matter how much you have on deposit. The rate that Marcus by Goldman Sachs usually pays is typically reserved for the highest-tier balances at other banks, if they even offer rates that high at all (although Marcus doesn\u2019t usually offer the highest rates available). Interest is compounded on your balance every day, and paid out on a monthly basis. Marcus even offers a referral bonus in which you and a friend can get a three-month 1.00% APY boost to your savings accounts. Competitive interest rates No minimum balance requirement No fees Possibility for higher earnings No sister checking account Goldman Sachs\u2019s primary focus is working with businesses and investors, not personal banking. But the bank needs to get its cash from somewhere, and that\u2019s where you come in. It operates its personal banking division, Marcus by Goldman Sachs (named after the bank\u2019s founder, Marcus Goldman), offering savings accounts with ultra-high rates to woo you into storing your cash with the bank. Marcus by Goldman Sachs is a bit different from other online banks. It doesn\u2019t offer any checking accounts, so you won\u2019t be able to use it for your everyday banking. It offers a smattering of a few other products, notably its high-yield CDs, investments, and co-branded General Motors credit cards. Instead, Marcus by Goldman Sachs is a perfect choice if you\u2019re hoping to park your savings away from your everyday checking account, to help you avoid any temptation to spend the money before you need it for your intended goal. It\u2019s a wise strategy that many people use, and you can benefit from the high interest rate to help propel you even faster toward your savings goals. Marcus Savings Account offers fairly high interest rates on its savings account, but it may not be the best option for everyone. Other options to consider include: The Fed cut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing them by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%\u20135.00% at its Sept. 18, 2024, meeting. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means savings rates will decline after reaching heights not seen in more than 20 years. You can open a high-yield savings account with Marcus directly on its website, or through the Marcus by Goldman Sachs mobile app. You\u2019ll need to provide basic information about yourself such as your name, address, and Social Security number. There is no minimum required deposit to open a savings account with Marcus, but you will need to deposit something within the first 60 days; otherwise, the bank will close the account. There is no minimum balance requirement to open or maintain a savings account with Marcus by Goldman Sachs. You can even open an account with a $0 balance if you want, although you will need to add at least $0.01 to the account within 60 days for it to remain open. You can keep up to $1,000,000 in a Marcus by Goldman Sachs high-yield online savings account. You\u2019re also limited to keeping a total of $3,000,000 in all of your Marcus by Goldman Sachs deposit accounts, such as in its high-yield CDs and savings account. Although Marcus by Goldman Sachs will let you keep up to $1,000,000 in its online high-yield savings account, it\u2019s best not to go over $250,000. That\u2019s the limit of FDIC insurance, and if the bank fails, that\u2019s the most you\u2019ll be able to get back. Yes, Marcus by Goldman Sachs is an excellent choice for an online high-yield savings account. It features some of the highest rates you can find these days (although it\u2019s usually still possible to find even higher rates), has no fees, and has no balance requirements\u2014all things that make it a customer-friendly option.

Barclays Bank offers a single savings account option with a competitive (but not top-tier) APY Moon Safari/Getty Images Barclays Bank is an online-only bank known for offering customers competitive interest rates on a limited selection of savings accounts of up to 4.8%. The bank\u2019s savings account interest rates are significantly higher than the national average (though higher APYs are often available elsewhere if you shop around). Barclays customers can also enjoy the convenience of no monthly maintenance fees, no minimum deposit requirements, and free online transfers to and from other financial institutions. It\u2019s important to shop around and compare what other banks and credit unions have to offer in terms of savings account rates and features. Although Barclays Bank savings rates outperform the national average, savvy shoppers may be able to find better APYs on high-yield savings accounts and CDs elsewhere. And some financial institutions may also offer savings account bonuses for new customers that could be worth considering as well. If you\u2019re a fan of uncomplicated banking, Barclays could suit you. You don\u2019t have to worry about account minimums. There\u2019s no minimum deposit requirement you must meet, and no limit to the number of withdrawals you can make per month. Likewise, you don\u2019t need to maintain a minimum balance to keep your savings account open, and for the Online Savings account you don't have to satisfy any minimum balance requirements to qualify for a higher APY tier. (Note: If you have a balance of less than $1 for 180 days or more, Barclays does reserve the right to close your account.) As far as other bank fees are concerned, Barclays\u2019 fees are notably lower than what other financial institutions might charge. For example, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the average non-sufficient funds (NSF) fee was $34 in 2022. Barclays, by comparison, charges just $5 for NSF fees. Here are some of the fees you might incur using your Barclays Savings account. Barclays savings accounts and CDs also come with insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). So, you can rest easy knowing that your deposits are safe in the unlikely event of a bank failure. The FDIC insures deposits for up to $250,000 (per depositor, per ownership category, per FDIC-insured bank). Low fees No minimum balance requirement No withdrawal limits No U.S. branches No checking accounts Limited withdrawal options Barclays is a British international bank with headquarters based in London, England\u2014where it traces its roots back over 300 years. The U.S. subsidiary of Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank, is located in Wilmington, Delaware. Barclays is perhaps best known for its variety of co-branded credit cards. Well-qualified applicants can open Barclays credit cards that feature rewards, cash back, and sometimes balance transfer opportunities. The online bank has limited options where savings are concerned. Aside from the savings accounts above, the only other type of savings-related deposit accounts the bank offers are certificates of deposit, but they sometimes have very competitive APYs; see Barclays CD rates to learn more. Barclays Bank could be a solid choice for savers who are comfortable with online banking and don\u2019t need direct ATM access to their funds. The bank\u2019s Online Savings account offers a simple, uncomplicated way to earn above-average interest rates without having to worry about minimum balances, APY tiers, or monthly maintenance fees. And the Tiered Savings account may offer a higher rate than that for a higher balance. However, if your primary goal is to earn the highest interest rate possible on your savings, you might want to consider other savings account options as well; check out the best high-yield savings accounts to see what you could get. You earn interest on your Barclays savings account in the same basic way that interest works on savings accounts from other financial institutions. Interest begins to accrue on the same business day you deposit cash into your savings account. From there, the interest will compound daily. The bank credits any interest you earn to your account once a month. Barclays Bank is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Therefore, any cash you deposit in a Barclays savings account, certificate of deposit, or other type of deposit account will receive the backing of FDIC insurance. Not all bank accounts are insured by the FDIC. When you choose a financial institution, it\u2019s important to choose a bank that\u2019s a member of the FDIC or a credit union that\u2019s a member of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to protect your savings. Barclays\u2019 online banking business along with its credit card and payment group is based in Wilmington, Delaware. The Barclays Wealth unit is headquartered in New York, New York. However, the parent company of Barclays Bank, now called Barclays UK, traces its roots back to 1690 in London, England.

Charles Schwab\u2019s savings account has a slightly higher-than-average APY, but you can find better rates elsewhere Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning. Bojanstory / Getty Images Charles Schwab\u2019s savings account interest rates tend to be slightly higher than the national average, and there are no monthly fees or account minimums. However, you can find higher annual percentage yields (APYs) from other financial institutions. Charles Schwab offers many valuable banking products, but rates on its savings account\u2014while higher than the national average\u2014are not very high. Compare Schwab to some of the high-yield savings accounts below to find the right bank (or broker) for you. The Schwab Bank Investor Savings account has no minimum deposit, making it a good choice for those just starting out who may struggle to come up with the high minimum deposits some other banks require. The account doesn\u2019t have any monthly fees either, making it a useful free savings account option. Interest on the Investor Savings account is compounded daily, and it\u2019s added to your account on the last day of the statement period. Typically, banks limit you to six withdrawals per month from a savings account. But Schwab indefinitely suspended enforcement of that limit, and the bank won\u2019t take any action against customers that exceed six withdrawals. If you\u2019re thinking about opening an Investor Savings account, you should know that it has an unusual application process. While other banks allow you to open accounts online or over the phone, Schwab Bank requires you to download a form, fill it out, and submit it through the mail or by fax. The only exception to that rule is if you\u2019re an existing Schwab customer and have an online account; in that case, you can sign into your account and upload the document instead. Use Investor.gov\u2019s compound interest calculator to find out how your money can grow with one of the best high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs). Very few fees Good customer reviews Unlimited ATM fee refunds Can\u2019t deposit cash directly Lukewarm interest rate Clunky application process Savings accounts are typically meant for storing your money long-term rather than making frequent ATM withdrawals. However, Charles Schwab\u2019s checking account also offers unlimited ATM fee refunds. With Charles Schwab, you can open a savings account, checking account, or credit card, and you can even take out a loan. But it doesn\u2019t offer other savings products like certificates of deposit (CDs) or money market accounts directly\u2014instead, it acts as a brokerage for those account types. You can use a Charles Schwab brokerage account to invest in bonds, CDs, and money market funds. You can invest in these securities by opening a taxable investment account, individual retirement account (IRA), or a custodial account. Charles Schwab operates over 400 branches nationwide. You can find a branch near you with the locator tool. Charles Schwab offers a decent savings account in terms of fees and features, especially if you plan on withdrawing cash frequently from ATMs. But the APY is quite low, so you won\u2019t earn much compared to more competitive accounts. If you\u2019re looking to grow your liquid savings a bit faster than what Charles Schwab Savings Account interest rates can offer, consider these other options: Many types of savings vehicles\u2014especially investments\u2014are not always FDIC-insured. The best account for you depends on your goals and timeline. If you\u2019re building an emergency fund or saving money for a specific goal and hope to accomplish it within a few years, protecting your money is the key priority. In those cases, a savings account can be the better choice; your money will not lose value, and it earns a little interest over time. If your time horizon is longer, such as saving for your retirement in 30 years, a brokerage account is typically a better option. Because you have more time to recover from market fluctuations, investing with a brokerage account can allow you to earn higher returns. No\u2014although Charles Schwab\u2019s savings account does offer a higher yield than many other banks, it\u2019s far from being a true \u201chigh-yield savings account\u201d when you compare it to the best savings account rates available. The Schwab Investor Savings account does not have a minimum deposit requirement. With the Schwab Investor Savings account, interest on your account is compounded daily. The interest is credited to your account on the last day of the statement period. To open a savings account with Charles Schwab, you must be at least 18, and you need to download an application. The form asks for the following information: After filling out the form, you have to bring it to a Charles Schwab location, fax it to (888) 526-7252, or mail it to one of the following addresses: Yes, Charles Schwab Bank is FDIC-insured.

With lower-than-average rates and monthly fees on its savings accounts, U.S. Bank may not be the best option Xavier Lorenzo / Getty Images As of Nov. 12, 2024, U.S. Bank has discontinued the Standards Savings product. U.S. Bank only has one savings account option and its interest rate of 0.01% is significantly low.\u00a0You can easily find savings account that pay higher yields, including with some of the best high-yield savings accounts. The APYs listed below use ZIP code 55402 (that of U.S. Bank's headquarters) and are up to date as of the date of publication of this article. We review the bank\u2019s savings account rates every two weeks and update the information below accordingly. If you're looking for a high interest rate on a bank account, you will want to compare U.S. Bank's rate with other offerings. Many banks offer a significantly higher rate and potentially better terms. U.S. Bank\u2019s single personal savings account is the Standard Savings account. You can open an account online with as little as $25, and set up account alerts and automatic savings to build your money. It may be easily accessible, but the account\u2019s annual percentage yield (APY) is significantly lower than the national average for savings accounts, so your money will grow very little over time. U.S. Bank compounds interest in savings accounts daily, and it credits the interest to your account quarterly. Unlike some banks that have free savings accounts, U.S. Bank charges monthly fees on the Standard Savings account; it charges $4 per month to maintain the account. But there are some ways to qualify for a waiver of the monthly fee: There are no fees or surcharges at U.S. Bank ATMs, but transactions at other ATMs will incur a $2.50 fee. Wide branch network Potential to waive monthly fee Very low interest rate Monthly maintenance fees Despite only operating branches in 26 states, U.S. Bank is one of the largest banks in the country. It offers a variety of banking products, including checking accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), money market accounts, and investment accounts. Some of U.S. Bank\u2019s money market accounts and CDs have significantly higher APYs than the national average for the respective products. And it also has several options to choose from. U.S. Bank\u2019s standard CDs may have promotional offers, allowing you to secure a higher APY under certain terms. But U.S. Bank has other CDs too, such as step-up CDs that allow you to lock in regular rate increases, and trade-up CDs that you can use to take advantage of rising rates after the CD is opened. Although you can open a U.S. Bank account online, it only has branches in 26 states. If you want to visit a local branch, use the bank\u2019s locator tool to see if there is one near you. U.S. Bank requires a minimum deposit of $25 to open a savings account. Some of its other accounts, such as money market accounts and CDs, have higher minimums. You may need to deposit at least $100 to $1,000 with those accounts. U.S. Bank\u2019s Standard Savings account has a lower-than-average APY, so it doesn\u2019t qualify as a high-yield savings account (HYSA). High-yield savings accounts typically pay out 10 to 12 times the national average, so they\u2019re attractive options for those who want their money to grow faster.

But take note: State Farm savings account interest rates of 0.01% are much lower than the national average and many of the best savings accounts, and U.S. Bank charges monthly account fees. State Farm's savings account rates may vary by location, and the rates listed below may not be available in all regions. The APYs listed below use Anderson County, Texas.

But in 2020, State Farm and U.S. Bank announced a strategic alliance, and U.S. Bank took over State Farm\u2019s existing deposit and credit card accounts. Through their agreement, customers could open U.S. Bank accounts through State Farm insurance agents or State Farm\u2019s website. Besides its insurance products, you can also open savings and investment accounts through State Farm. Certain banking products, such as the State Farm money market account and certificate of deposit (CD) accounts, are issued through its agreement with U.S. Bank. Some of the CDs and money market accounts offer much higher-than-average annual percentage yields (APYs), so they could be a good option to build your savings. State Farm does manage its own investment products, including 529 education savings plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). State Farm allows customers to open a U.S. Bank savings account with a small minimum deposit. But, as mentioned, State Farm savings account interest rates are quite low. To maximize your savings, consider these other options instead. Through its alliance with U.S. Bank, State Farm offers a Standard Savings account with a minimum deposit of $25. If you\u2019re looking for a higher APY, you can also open a CD or money market account. If you open a savings account through State Farm\u2019s partner, U.S. Bank, you can quickly and easily wire transfer money from your savings account online or through the U.S. Bank mobile app. State Farm previously offered health savings accounts (HSAs) to its customers. But in 2020, its HSAs were acquired by HSA Bank, so HSAs are no longer available through the insurer. See the best HSA providers here to find a great place to save for medical bills.

The accounts have no monthly fees, and you can get a free ATM card to use with no fees at in-network ATMs (SUM and MoneyPass ATMs).

Higher-than-average APY No monthly fees Allows cash deposits at ATMs Deposit requirement to earn best rate Low external transfer limit Lack of physical branches With a LendingClub savings account, you can deposit and withdraw cash at select MoneyPass ATMs. MoneyPass is a fee-free ATM network with over 40,000 locations nationwide. LendingClub was founded in 2006 as a digital installment loan platform. But in 2021, it acquired Radius Bancorp and became a bank holding company. Now, LendingClub offers a range of financial products, including personal loans, auto loans, checking accounts, and savings accounts. As a digital bank, LendingClub allows you to open accounts entirely online. You just need to provide your Social Security number, current U.S. address, email address, and the banking details of another bank account to make your initial deposit. Besides high-yield savings accounts, LendingClub also offers a certificate of deposit (CD). Its CD usually has a much higher-than-average APY, and you can choose from a variety of term lengths. LendingClub\u2019s checking accounts, savings accounts, and CDs are backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), so your deposits are insured up to $250,000. You can only open a LendingClub savings account online. You cannot open an account over the phone, and LendingClub doesn\u2019t operate any branches. If you want one-on-one assistance, you may want a more traditional brick-and-mortar bank or credit union. If LendingClub isn't right for you, consider one of the following alternatives to build your savings. LendingClub is a safe option. Like traditional brick-and-mortar banks, LendingClub\u2019s savings accounts are backed by the FDIC, so your deposits are insured up to $250,000. You can open a LendingClub savings account online. To open an account you must be at least 18 years old and a citizen or resident of the U.S. with a valid Social Security number. You'll also need at least $100 for the opening deposit for a high-yield account. According to LendingClub, you can fill out the account application and get a response within minutes. Lending Club doesn't ask for a minimum deposit to open either of its high-yield savings accounts. But you will need to deposit at least $250 per evaluation period to earn the best rate for the LevelUp Savings account. LendingClub doesn\u2019t operate branches, so you can\u2019t withdraw money from a teller. However, you can withdraw money at ATMs with your provided ATM card, or by transferring funds to another bank online via ACH. LendingClub is a useful option for those who want a bank account with no monthly fees. You can earn a much higher yield on your savings, and there\u2019s no ongoing minimum balance requirement. LendingClub's savings accounts are a legitimate banking option. LendingClub acquired Radius Bancorp in 2021 and formed LendingClub Bank. Today, it offers a range of banking products and its deposit accounts are backed by FDIC insurance. Deposits to a LendingClub savings or checking account are insured up to $250,000.

            "title": "What Is a Savings Account and How Does It Work?",
            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. A savings account is an account at a bank or credit union that is designed to hold your money. Savings accounts typically pay a modest interest rate, but they are considered safe for parking cash that you want available for short-term needs. Some savings accounts pay a higher yield than other savings accounts. They may have some limitations on how often you can withdraw funds. Generally, savings accounts offer flexibility that can be ideal for building an emergency fund, saving for a short-term goal like buying a car or going on vacation, or simply earning a little interest on your savings. Investopedia / Joules Garcia Savings and other deposit accounts are secure bank accounts used to story your funds while potentially earning interest. For banks, they are important sources of funds for lending. For that reason, you can find savings accounts at virtually every bank or credit union, whether they are traditional brick-and-mortar institutions or operate online. In addition, some investment and brokerage firms offer savings accounts. Savings account interest rates vary. With the exception of promotions promising a fixed rate until a certain date, banks and credit unions might change their rates at any time. Typically, the more competitive the rate, the more likely it is to fluctuate. Changes in the federal funds rate can trigger institutions to adjust their deposit rates. Some institutions offer high-yield savings accounts with significantly higher interest rates for larger minimum deposits, which may be worth investigating. Some conventional savings accounts require a minimum balance to avoid monthly fees or earn the highest published rate, while others have no balance requirement. Know the rules of your particular account to ensure you avoid diluting your earnings with fees. Money can be transferred in or out of your savings account online, at a branch or ATM, by electronic transfer, or by direct deposit. Transfers can usually be arranged by phone, as well. Some banks limit withdrawals to six per month. If you exceed that, the bank may charge a fee, close your account, or convert it to a checking account. The amount you can withdraw is unlimited, so you can withdraw up to the amount in the account. Just as with the interest earned on a money market, certificate of deposit, or checking account, the interest earned on savings accounts is taxable income. The financial institution where you hold your account will send a 1099-INT form at tax time whenever you earn more than $10 in interest income. The tax you\u2019ll pay will depend on your marginal tax rate. Easy to use Can be linked to checking account Withdraw balance at any time Up to $250,000 is federally insured Pays less interest than other options Easy access can make withdrawals tempting May require minimum balance Although most major banks offer low interest rates on their savings accounts, many banks and credit unions provide much higher returns. In particular, online banks offer some of the highest savings account rates. Because they don\u2019t have physical branches\u2014or have very few\u2014they spend less on overhead and can often offer higher, more competitive deposit rates as a result. The key is to shop around, starting with the bank where you hold your checking account. Even if that institution doesn\u2019t offer a competitive savings account rate, it will give you a frame of reference for how much more you can earn by moving your savings or opening an additional account elsewhere. As you shop for the best rates, however, beware of account features that can curtail your earnings, or even drain them. Some promotional savings accounts will only offer the attractive rate they\u2019re advertising for a short period of time. Others will cap the balance that can earn the promotional rate, with dollar amounts above that maximum earning a paltry rate. Even worse is a savings account with fees that cut into the interest you earn each month. To set up a savings account, visit one of the bank or credit union\u2019s branches, or establish the account online, for those institutions that offer it. You\u2019ll need to provide your name, address, and telephone number, as well as photo identification. Also, because the account earns taxable interest, you\u2019ll need to provide your Social Security number (SSN). Some institutions will require you to make an initial minimum deposit at the time you open the account. Others will allow you to open the account first and fund it later. You can make your initial deposit in a savings account with a transfer from an account at that institution, an external transfer, a mailed-in or mobile deposit check, or a deposit in person at a branch. The amount you keep in your savings account will depend on your goals for the funds, or your use of the account. If you\u2019ve set up the savings account to sweep excess funds from your checking account, your balance is likely to vary regularly. In contrast, if you are building up to a savings goal, your balance will likely start low and increase steadily over time. If your savings account is your emergency fund, aim for enough to cover at least three to six months\u2019 living expenses. That gives you some financial cushion if you face an unexpected expense like a medical or car repair bill or if you lose your job. Depending on your financial situation, you may want to keep some of that emergency fund in a simple savings account, and invest the rest to seek higher returns. Keep in mind that up to $250,000 of your deposits are protected by FDIC insurance or NCUA insurance. That ensures your funds are safe should the institution fail. For most consumers, this more than covers what they have on deposit. But if you are holding more than $250,000 in deposit accounts, consider splitting your balance across more than one account holder or institution. You must be 18 or over to open a savings account on your own in the U.S. But many savings accounts are designed for minors. You can get a savings account for a child by co-signing for the account. Bank accounts designed for students usually have maximum age restrictions. For example, you may not be able to open a student bank account if you are over 25. These accounts, designed to teach younger adults how to use a bank account, usually have lower fees and requirements, but they also tend to offer lower interest rates. You can open a savings account by visiting a bank branch with your government-issued ID and any cash or checks you wish to deposit. You will also be asked for your address, contact information, and a Social Security number or taxpayer identification number (TIN). You may have to open a checking account as well as a savings account, and there may be a minimum deposit threshold. It is also possible to open a savings account with an online bank. Savings account rates change often, so it is worth taking the time to compare the offerings from different banks and credit unions. As of June 2024, the best savings rates ranged from about 4.5% to 5.5%. Most banks allow three ways to close an account. You can either visit the bank in person, submit a written cancellation request form, or close the account over the phone. In each case, you may be asked to provide identifying information. Savings accounts offer one of the simplest ways to earn interest on the money you have. They offer higher interest rates than a regular checking account, while still making it easy to spend and withdraw money. However, savings account rates are much lower than other investments, and they don't keep pace with inflation. Consult a financial advisor to review the options for you money to meet your financial goals.

            "title": "What Is Joint? A Definition, How It Works, and Risks",
            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. Weekend Images Inc. / Getty Images Joint is a legal term describing a financial transaction or agreement where two or more parties act in unison. Joint can pertain to accounts or ownership in real property such as joint-owned property. This is property owned by two or more people, who may be business partners, spouses, family members, or friends. If land, a home, or a business is owned jointly, each participating party shares in both the risks and rewards. Joint can also refer to liability. Joint liability exists in situations where two or more people share the burden of a debt. For example, if a husband and wife have joint liability for a tax debt, each is responsible for the entire amount of the debt. There may be ways to request relief from tax, interest, and penalty liabilities resulting from a joint tax return. Consult with a tax attorney or other certified professional for details. Joint, as a term, can be applied to a wide variety of financial situations, including the following. The FDIC estimates that up to one-third of bank deposit accounts are joint accounts. With joint accounts, two or more parties share a single account. The law and financial institutions typically consider both parties to be equal owners, regardless of who started the account or contributed more money. Joint accounts may benefit from more than the typical $250,000 insurance from the FDIC, as each co-owner of a joint account is insured up to $250,000. If two people are qualified co-owners on a joint account, the account's contents could be insured for up to $500,000. Co-owners can spend or transfer funds to other accounts without the consent of the other account holder. Most joint accounts have rights of survivorship, which means that if one account holder dies, the other will automatically retain rights to the account funds. Joint tenancy refers to when two or more parties share equal shares of ownership in property with the same deed at the same time. This type of holding title is most common between spouses and among family members because rights of survivorship are involved, similar to joint accounts. Joint tenancy differs from a tenancy in common. With tenancy in common, tenants may have different shares of ownership that could be obtained at different times. Joint and survivor annuities are insurance products that continue regular payments as long as one of the annuitants is alive. A joint and survivor\u00a0annuity\u00a0must have two or more annuitants. Married couples may choose a joint annuity to guarantee that, in the case of death, the surviving spouse receives regular income for life. In a joint venture, two unaffiliated companies contribute financial and physical assets and personnel to a new company. Although joint ventures are generally considered partnerships, they can take on any legal structure. Joint ventures can help qualifying businesses (typically in a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship) compete for set-aside government contracts reserved for small businesses. Corporations, partnerships,\u00a0limited liability companies (LLCs),\u00a0and other business entities can all be involved in joint ventures. Joint venture agreements take into account the number of parties involved, the joint venture's operation scope, the terms of each party\u2019s role and contribution, the ownership split, and how the joint ventures will be administered, managed, and staffed. A joint home equity loan is a home equity loan with two co-borrowers. The co-borrowers can be spouses or a homeowner and a trusted loan co-signer\u00a0without interest in the property. A lender cannot treat married and unmarried co-borrowers differently. A joint applicant is someone who agrees to apply for a loan, credit card, or other financial product with you. The joint applicant's credit history and score will likely be considered alongside your own, which can help or hurt your application. Young adults under age 21 without income may need to find a joint applicant to apply for a credit card if the card issuer allows co-signers. If you help someone get a loan or credit card as a joint account holder, be careful. You're legally agreeing to pay back the loan or any amount borrowed.\u00a0Even if you and the other account holder are no longer on speaking terms in the future, the loan or credit card will appear on your credit reports, and you will be responsible for the debt. Any delinquent debt from a joint loan or card could lower your credit score, and a debt collection agency may seek to recover the debt. If the terms of your loan are unclear, seek legal advice from an attorney. Joint financial undertakings require two or more parties to accept ongoing responsibility for risks and rewards. A joint bank account could provide both parties with funds for paying rent, for example, but it also leaves you legally responsible for fees, even if your joint account owner's behavior led to penalties. Carefully consider the financial and legal implications of entering into a joint contract with another person, and speak with an attorney to ensure you understand potential risks.

            "title": "Employee Contribution Plan: Meaning, Design, Popularity",
            "content": "An employee contribution plan is a type of employer-sponsored savings plan. By choosing to participate in the plan, employees contribute a percentage of their paycheck into the plan, which is then invested on their behalf by a third-party plan administrator. Employers, meanwhile, will typically match a portion of the employee's contributions. Unlike a defined benefit plan, the employee does not know what the value of their savings plan will be in the future. Instead, that future value depends on a number of factors, including the size of contributions made by the employee, the extent to which their employer-matched those contributions, and the investment performance of the savings plan itself. Employee contribution plans are intended to help employees save for their future. In the United States, common examples of employee contribution plans include defined contribution pension plans such as the 401(k), employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), and corporate profit-sharing plans. Employee contribution plans have become more popular in recent decades, gaining ground relative to defined benefit plans. Under defined benefit plans, the employee is guaranteed a particular benefit paid to them in retirement. They can thus plan ahead for their retirement knowing that a certain level of income will be provided by their employer. By contrast, employee contribution plans offer no guarantee that any particular lump sum or income will be delivered in the future. Instead, the benefit received in the future will depend on the performance of the plan's invested assets; the employee may obtain less or more than they expected, depending on how the market behaves before they retire. In this manner, employee contribution plans effectively shift the investment risk from the employer to the employee. The employers who create employee contribution plans are known as the \"sponsors\" of those plans, whereas the companies who actually invest and oversee the plan assets are known as its plan administrators. These third-party companies are responsible for tasks such as record-keeping, regulatory compliance, and educating employees about their investment options. The employees, meanwhile, are fully responsible for choosing among the available investment options. Although the term \"401(k)\" is commonly used in the media, there are in fact many different types of 401(k) plans. These include safe harbor plans, automatic enrollment plans, and the Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees of Small Employers (SIMPLE). Typically, employee contribution plans will offer a range of debt and equity investment options to choose from, including domestic and international mutual funds, fixed-income funds, and money market investments. Although these selections tend to be relatively conservative, some plans also offer self-directed brokerage services through which the employee can select individual stock investments. In some cases, the employer sponsoring the plan will also offer their own company stock, sometimes on a discounted basis. Many employee contribution plans provide tax benefits. The portion of an employee's salary that is invested is pre-tax, which means that their taxable income is less, resulting in fewer taxes paid on their income. Taxes on the funds in the plan are incurred when they are withdrawn, which is usually during an individual's retirement when they are in a lower income-tax bracket. Employee contribution plans have been a very successful product and have been growing in popularity over time. Initially, the participation rate of contribution plans was low, but as they became more widely available and measures were taken to increase participation, such as automatic enrollment, they have seen a significant increase. Vanguard, one of the largest investment companies in the world, reports that participation in Vanguard's 401(k) plans has increased from 76% in 2010 to 83% in 2019. It also reports that the plan participation rate between 90% and 100% has increased from 21% to 49% in the same period, while a participation rate of less than 50% has decreased from 10% to 6%.\ufeff\ufeff Vanguard. \"How America Saves\" Page 30 and 31.

            "title": "How Does a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) Work?",
            "content": "The Federal Employees' Retirement Security Act of 1986 established the Thrift Savings Plan, or TSP. It is a qualified retirement plan for federal employees and members of the uniformed services. The Thrift Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan similar to a 401(k), which is a plan offered by companies in the private sector. The Thrift Savings Plan was introduced in 1986 through the Federal Employees Retirement System Act. A TSP allows federal workers to invest in a tax-advantaged retirement account. Much like an individual retirement account (IRA), there are traditional TSPs, in which money is taxed when you withdraw it, and Roth TSPs, where you pay taxes on contributions but the earnings are tax-free. Unlike IRAs, the contribution limits are quite a bit higher. In 2024, you can deposit $23,000 to a TSP, unless you're 50 and over, in which case the limit is $30,500 for the year. For 2025, the amounts are $23,500 and $31,000, respectively. After two years, most employees in a TSP are eligible for a full match of up to 5% of their salary. That's free money. If you are part of the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) or the Blended Retirement System (BRS), your agency may match your contributions. Most agencies automatically contribute 1% of your salary to a TSP and an additional 4% after two years of service. Investopedia / Jake Shi The Thrift Savings Plan accepts rollovers from previous retirement plans such as a past 401(k) or IRA. Likewise, if a participant terminates employment and goes to work in the private sector, the Thrift Savings Plan account can either remain intact or be rolled over into the new employer's plan or to a traditional IRA. Although the Thrift Savings Plan is limited in its available investment options, it does offer a low-cost way for government workers to save efficiently for retirement. As with other qualified retirement plans, the participant can choose and allocate any percentage of their account assets into any desired funds. The available funds are below. A sixth choice is to invest in one of the 11 Lifecycle, or L, Funds, containing a percentage of all five individual funds. As the chosen Lifecycle Fund approaches maturity and the fund holder's retirement year, the funds in the portfolio are rebalanced toward less risky assets. The annual contribution limit for the Thrift Savings Plan is $23,000 in 2024 and $23,500 in 2025. If you are 50 and older, you can contribute an additional $7,500 in 2024 and 2025. The Thrift Savings Plan is a qualified retirement plan for federal employees and members of the uniformed services. A 401(k) plan is a qualified retirement plan for the private sector. Both plans have the same contribution limits and are structured similarly, but there are some differences. If you quit your job, your Thrift Savings Plan will remain as is if the balance is $200 or more, and it will continue earning. You can control the account and adjust your\u00a0investments\u00a0but can't make any more contributions. In addition, you can request a distribution of all or a portion of your account and put the money in another retirement account. Yes, but there are several restrictions to doing so. There are two types of in-service withdrawals: financial hardship withdrawals and age 59 1/2 withdrawals. When you make an in-service withdrawal, you permanently reduce your TSP account by the amount you take out, and you also give up any future earnings on that amount. Once the withdrawal is made, you can't return or repay the money to your account, and you can't convert your withdrawal to a loan. Also, be aware that you must pay federal and, in some cases, state income taxes on the taxable portion of your withdrawal. If you make a financial hardship withdrawal before age 59 1/2, you may also have to pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty tax. A Thrift Savings Plan is a major component of compensation for employees of the federal government and armed services. Not only does it provide a tax-advantaged form of retirement savings, but the government also will match employees' contributions to help them save for retirement. As with other retirement plans, the most important thing is to start early.

            "title": "Savings Club: What It Means, How It Works",
            "content": "uchar / Getty Images A savings club is a bank account where the account holder contributes regularly toward a goal. These clubs are usually short-term bank accounts set up by a credit union or bank to help customers save for a specific period. Savings clubs often offer incentives to encourage customers to make their intended contributions. For example, withdrawing from a savings club prematurely might lead to the forfeiture of interest previously accrued. Many credit unions offer savings clubs. Savings clubs can be established with various terms and restrictions but typically share a schedule where the depositors make regular deposits before a deadline. You'll likely need to make an initial contribution, typically from $5 to $50. Then, contributions are often drawn from an automatic deduction from payroll or by direct deposit. Customers can ensure steady, consistent progress toward their savings goal and deadline. The interest rate may be higher than in a typical savings account, but your savings club account may need a minimum balance to earn dividends or interest. Interest in the account is usually compounded, although at intervals that vary by account (monthly, quarterly, or annually). Early withdrawal from a savings club before the club's deadline may automatically close the account and forfeit some or all interest. You might also pay an account closing fee and an early withdrawal fee. The savings club deadline is generally associated with a savings goal, such as a planned vacation or the holiday shopping season. Funds in the savings club are typically automatically transferred out at the deadline, but each institution and club works differently. Check in with your credit union or financial institution to read the fine print. Consider high-yield savings accounts before deciding on a savings club account. Although they usually don't have deadlines and regular deposit requirements, their high interest rates allow you to grow your savings relatively quickly. Credit unions typically offer a variety of savings clubs. Here are some of the most common. The\u00a0first Christmas savings club\u00a0was started by the Carlisle Trust Company of\u00a0Pennsylvania in 1909. Christmas Clubs are one of the most popular and widely available savings clubs today. With a Christmas club, also known today as a holiday club, a saver makes regular contributions throughout the year and then withdraws funds to spend on the holidays. Withdrawals may be restricted until a specific date in November or December. A vacation club helps you save for next year's big trip with automatic contributions over the coming year. As a result, this saving club account type usually has a late spring to early summer withdrawal date. Tax club savings accounts can help build funds to pay your property taxes or federal or state income taxes. Tax club account types may offer twice-annual withdrawal dates, typically in spring and fall. Depending on your credit union, you may also see the following saving clubs: A CD with a high interest rate may be a good alternative to a savings club. But you usually need to stash money as a lump sum in a CD for a specific term, unless you find an add-on CD. Like a savings club, CDs usually feature a penalty for early withdrawal. Savings club accounts may offer slightly higher interest than typical savings accounts. However, savings club accounts also often involve penalties for withdrawing funds prematurely and may require automatic contributions. So, the account's actual financial performance depends on how well you adhere to the intended program. Justice and Skyler are saving for a long-planned vacation to Hawaii. The pair enrolled in a savings club bank account a year in advance to help fund their trip. Because their particular savings club involves saving for a vacation, it is commonly known as a vacation club account. The duo contribute $50 per month for 11 months, beginning on June 15. The club ends June 1 of the following year. They earn interest but face penalties if they withdraw their funds before the June 1 end date. On June 1, Justice and Skyler's vacation funds are transferred into their joint account, along with interest earned during the year. With these savings in hand, they can fund their summer vacation without relying on consumer debt. A traditional susu or sou-sou is an informal savings club originating in West Africa and the Caribbean. A group of family and friends pay a fixed, equal amount of money into a common fund on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis. A treasurer is selected, and a member payment schedule is created. Then, each member gets paid until all susu members receive their share.\u00a0However, multiple federal and city government agencies warn people to watch out for fake susu savings clubs and scams that lead to losses. A savings club's primary disadvantages include fees for early withdrawals and account closures, required minimums to earn interest, and lack of access to funds until the club's stated deadline. The enforced savings aspect may outweigh these disadvantages. However, it may be wise to ensure you have a significant emergency fund so you don't have to draw on savings club money in a financially urgent situation. Check out high-yield savings accounts, which don't have those restrictions, as an alternative to savings clubs. Savings clubs allow people to build funds throughout the year for an established goal, earn interest on savings, and receive funds in time to spend on the goal. Saving for a goal may help avoid racking up credit card debt. Many savings clubs don't have monthly bank account fees and only charge a penalty if you don't follow the savings club's rules. A savings club could help you save toward the holidays, a vacation, tax season, or other goals. Combining automatic contributions, penalties, and a financial goal can help many savers stay on track. To find a savings club, look for a credit union where you qualify to join as a member, and remember to compare rates to high-yield savings accounts and CDs.

Investopedia / Ellen Lindner Health Savings Account (HSA) rules and limits include a maximum amount you can contribute to your HSA account for 2024 and 2025 and which types of health insurance plans qualify as a \"high deductible health plan.\" If you can meet the requirements, consider signing up for an HSA plan through our list of the best HSA account providers. Then, you can fund the HSA up to the allowable contribution limit. A\u00a0Health Savings Account (HSA) can be used as a tax-advantaged savings tool or to pay medical bills. According to the federal guidelines, you can open and contribute to an HSA if you: Veterans can use high-deductible health plans and HSAs for non-service-connected care. As its name implies, an HDHP is a health care plan that trades relatively low monthly\u00a0premiums\u00a0for relatively high deductibles. The HDHP must meet certain criteria to qualify for an HSA that can be opened in combination with it. In combination with a\u00a0HDHP, HSA funds can pay a wide variety of health care costs until you meet your plan's deductible and health care coverage kicks in. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\u00a0establishes guidelines annually, adjusting the figures for inflation. Here are the qualifying criteria for 2024 and 2025: The out-of-pocket maximum. It can include deductibles,\u00a0co-payments, and\u00a0co-insurance. It does not include insurance premiums. The out-of-pocket maximum will not usually include out-of-network services. Contributions to an HSA are tax-deductible. For employer-sponsored plans, the contributions are deducted from paychecks. If you're self-employed, the deductions can be taken when your annual taxes are prepared. Withdrawals from an HSA are tax-free, provided the money is used to pay for qualified\u00a0medical expenses. These expenses can include payments for dental and vision care, which some medical health insurance plans don't cover. Most HSAs issue a\u00a0debit card that can be used to pay for prescription medications and other eligible expenses. If you wait for a bill to come in the mail, you can make a payment over the phone using your debit card. Any money that is in your account at the end of the year remains in your account to pay for future qualified medical expenses. End-of-year balances are carried over indefinitely. The account and its funds belong to you, and you retain ownership even if you change health insurance plans, change jobs, or retire. While it's in the account, the money grows tax-free. The IRS sets limits that determine the combined amount that you, your employer, and any other person can contribute to your HSA for 2024 and 2025: If you are 55 or older, you can add up to $1,000 more yearly as a \"catch-up\" contribution. So, instead of being limited to a contribution of $4,150 for 2024, you're limited to a contribution of $5,150. An HSA can help cover expenses not covered by your health insurance plan. For example, if your medical plan doesn't cover dental or vision care, HSA funds can still be used for those bills. However, HSA funds can also help pay for any qualified medical expenses incurred by you, your spouse, and your dependents. The IRS establishes what is and isn't a qualified medical expense, as detailed in\u00a0IRS Publication 502, Medical and Dental Expenses. Qualified expenses include nearly any medical cost, including payments for diagnostics, cures, mitigations, treatments, and prescribed preventative medications. HSA can also be used to make payments that count toward your deductible. There are a few things that an HSA cannot be used for. You can't use it to pay insurance premiums. Other ineligible expenses include over-the-counter items like toothpaste, toiletries, and cosmetics, as well as most cosmetic surgeries. A vacation to a healthier climate would also not qualify. If you're 64 or younger and withdraw funds for a non-qualified expense, you'll owe income taxes on the money, plus a 20% penalty. If you're 65 or over or are disabled, you'll still owe taxes on the amount but will be spared the penalty. You first need to enroll in an HDHP. If you take that step through your employer's\u00a0human resources department, it should be able to advise you on creating your HSA. Most employer-sponsored HDHPs have an associated HSA provider with which you can work. If an HSA is not included with your HDHP, you can set it up independently. Banks, credit unions, and brokerages all offer HSAs. Each HSA provider can create its own terms for the funds. HSAs, through a\u00a0brokerage,\u00a0even allow you to invest your contributions in stocks, bonds, or other funds. Bank HSAs\u00a0usually offer an optimal interest rate. Once you select a provider, the enrollment process is fairly straightforward: You must complete an application with information on your HDHP. Once your account is approved, you can fund it and use it for qualified expenses. An HSA can be used as a tax-sheltered investment vehicle. For savvy investors, they create an opportunity to accumulate capital gains that can be withdrawn tax-free for medical expenses. Most HSA account holders will want to be somewhat conservative in investing this money since it is intended for necessary medical costs. This can limit the investments an account holder may wish to make with their HSA contributions to low-risk investments. The type of account opened will dictate the type of investments available. Plans provided through banks usually offer only high-yield savings deposits, while brokers offer much more. HSAs were established in 2003 as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. High-deductible health plans (HDHPs) make sense for young, relatively healthy people with minimal annual health care needs. Plan owners can potentially save indefinitely through an HSA for future emergencies that may require a high deductible payment or for health care needs in retirement. For high-income earners\u00a0and those approaching retirement, the HSA can build a medical emergency fund while\u00a0saving in an alternative retirement vehicle. High-earners choosing an HDHP can use an HSA to save up to $8,550 for 2025 ($8,300 for 2024) in a tax-sheltered account. No. Only people who have high-deductible health insurance plans can open a Health Savings Account (HSA). Some employers offer a similar plan called a flexible spending account (FSA). Employees can choose to divert up to the annual limit, tax-free, into an account to pay uncovered medical expenses. The FSA money in your account doesn't roll over from year to year. You use it or lose it. An HSA helps people pay for expected and unexpected expenses not covered by a high-deductible health insurance plan. Moreover, the money you pay into the account is tax-sheltered and works somewhat like a 401(k) plan or IRA. The money accumulates every year without incurring taxes. If you don't use all of the money in your account, it can act as a retirement nest egg for when your health care expenses are higher. The money deducted from your paycheck and paid into an HSA can only be used for medical expenses. If you take the money out for any other reason, you'll owe income taxes plus a 20% penalty unless you're over 65. If you have a high-deductible health insurance plan, having a Health Savings Account can give you some peace of mind regarding unexpected (and uncovered) medical expenses. Better yet, any money in your account that you don't have to use will continue to accumulate tax-free over time. You can also withdraw tax-free as long as you're withdrawing for qualifying medical expenses. On the other hand, remember that a high-deductible health plan might not be the right choice if you expect to incur substantial health costs soon. Even though you will pay lower premiums with the HDHP, it could be difficult\u2014even with money in an HSA\u2014to come up with the immediate cash to meet the deductible for a costly medical procedure.
