We researched 21 digital wealth management platforms and evaluated them on 59 criteria, including cost, account services, goal planning tools, and more. Investing in the stock market and putting your money to work can be a beneficial strategy for building wealth. However, investing is complex and requires considerable financial literacy to be effective. Those who cannot dedicate the necessary time or commitment may want to consider a robo-advisor. However, robo-advisors are still subject to the same risks and market fluctuations as other online brokers and investing platforms.

Acorns Logo Read full review Those unaccustomed to saving will appreciate Acorns\u2019 \u201cround-up\u201d feature, which automatically diverts spare change into investment dollars. When spending from linked debit and credit cards, the difference between the purchase amount and the next whole dollar is invested for the future. Elegant solution to get young people to begin saving and investing Multiplier feature enables faster investment growth Low-fee, diversified investment portfolio options For small accounts, fees can be a large percent of account value Without added saving and investing, the round-up feature will take a long time to build a meaningful investment amount Limited account types Acorns was founded in 2012 by four colleagues, including the father-son team of Jeff Cruttenden and Walter Cruttenden, in Irvine, California. The company fills the need for small investors to save and invest by rounding up their spending and diverting the difference into an investment account. Presently, $3 billion has been invested through round-ups of spare change. The micro-saving app asks users several goals-based questions and recommends an appropriate diversified investment portfolio. The app is linked to one or more debit or credit cards. When you spend with a linked card, the difference between the purchase and the next whole dollar amount is deducted from your linked checking account and invested in your Acorns Invest account. For faster growth, users can multiply their savings and invest with the Round-Ups Multiplier. The multiplier will double, triple, or 10x the amount of the round-up. Acorns users need to realize that when solely using the standard round-up feature, it will take a very long time to build a meaningful investment portfolio. Since investment dollars originate from the user's checking account, you need to monitor the account closely to avoid overdrafts, as overdraft fees could be incurred if you are not careful.

Formerly catering to the wealthiest Americans and investment banking activities, the company now strives to serve a wider range of clients.\u00a0Merrill Guided Investing benefits from the company\u2019s deep well of investment management expertise and educational tools. The robo-advisor is unique, with a mix of technology-based investment management and oversight by Merrill investment professionals, spearheaded by the company\u2019s Chief Investment Office. Investment portfolios are created to reflect your goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. They also include access to sustainable ESG offers. The investment portfolios deviate from the standard passively managed robo-advisory offerings. They are constructed and managed using strategic and tactical asset allocations, which vary based on the user's specific goals, risk tolerance, financial situation, timeline, and expected returns, as well as current and predicted market conditions. The standout educational offerings include webinars, Morningstar Investing Classroom, and investor education videos. Sample webinar categories include Investor Psychology, Thematic Investing with ETFs, and Sustainable Investing. The partnership with Morningstar includes scores of free courses across investment topics such as stocks, mutual funds, bonds, ETFs, and portfolio creation. Videos span platform-specific and investment objectives. Rounding out the Learn Portal are tools and calculators for retirement, investing, college planning, and personal finance. Choosing the best robo-advisor for your personal goals, financial situation, and risk tolerance depends on many factors. When making this choice, among the most important considerations are the level of customization you need, the different account types that are available, whether access to financial planners is important to you, and whether you require integrated banking or brokerage services. Investment minimums and monthly maintenance fees are also critical considerations. Use this list of the best robo-advisors as a starting point to evaluate each platform. Then, continue your research by exploring our in-depth reviews of all of the major robo-advisors. All robo-advisors enable online account setup, but that\u2019s where the similarities often end. Many digital wealth management platforms follow passive investment strategies attempting to match the overall growth of the market; however, different portfolio risk levels, allocation strategies, and customization methods often lead to varying portfolio performance. When considering robo-advisors, investors should prioritize a broad range of offerings, account amenities, and the costs associated with the service. It's crucial that the platform provides a diverse array of investment options that cater to different financial goals and risk levels. Account amenities such as easy account setup, intuitive dashboard, and accessible customer support enhance the user experience, making it straightforward for investors to manage their portfolios. Additionally, robust educational resources within the robo-advisor can empower investors to make informed decisions about their investment strategy and goal planning. Cost-effectiveness is also a key consideration, so investors need to evaluate not only the platform\u2019s management fees but also underlying fund expenses and any additional charges. Furthermore, advanced features such as tax-loss harvesting, automatic rebalancing, and goal-based investing tools can enhance the value proposition of a robo-advisor, providing investors with a comprehensive and hassle-free investment experience. By prioritizing these key features, investors can select a robo-advisor that aligns with their financial objectives and empowers them to achieve their long-term investment goals with confidence. - Amrut Deshmukh, Investopedia Research Analyst Investopedia collected 1,239 data points from 21 robo-advisor companies to identify the most important factors to investors. We used this data to review each digital wealth management platform for fees, portfolio management services, goal planning tools, and other key features to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decision for their investing needs. A robo-advisor is an investment platform that manages investments on an investor\u2019s behalf using survey responses and algorithms. The algorithms that a robo-advisor uses to manage your portfolio are based on modern portfolio theory (MPT), which seeks to select investments to maximize returns within an acceptable level of risk through diversification. The information you provide to a robo-advisor, including your age, your investment timeline, and some proxy for your risk appetite, is fed into the MPT-based algorithm to find the ideal portfolio within the asset types offered by the robo-advisor. Robo-advisors primarily differ from each other in their complexity and their asset offerings, in addition to the primary differences in account minimums and cost. More advanced robo-advisors can handle multiple portfolios on your behalf, with each portfolio representing a different investment goal and timeline. As for asset offerings, most robo-advisors create the majority of your portfolio using exchange-traded funds, but some offer actual direct asset purchases to accounts of a specific size. These direct-purchase assets can include shares, bonds, REITs, actively managed funds, and so on. \"Robo-advisors have gotten more sophisticated over the years, offering clients the opportunity to open accounts with automated indexing, as well as accounts where you can choose your own stocks on the same platform. Even the acceptable ownership structures have evolved, with many now allowing entities and revocable trusts to be listed as account owners. When analyzing a robo-advisor, make sure all of these features are available, in case the complexity of your needs increases over time.\" - Brenton Harrison, a member of Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council. Choosing the best robo-advisor is highly dependent on your financial situation. However, there are certain steps you can take to ensure you select the correct robo-advisor for your financial needs. Human advisors have traditionally worked to help people understand their investment goals and needs. Similarly, robo-advisors can take you through helpful prompts and provide tools to help you properly fill in the details. In the end, however, their understanding of your financial situation and future plans is based mostly on what you input. In general, to get the most out of a robo-advisor, you need to do most of the work yourself, without the guidance of a human advisor. Every investor has different goals when it comes to buying a house, saving for retirement, paying for college (for yourself or a dependent), and so on. Depending on your age, you may need to prioritize certain goals over others. The more definition you can give to your goals, the better a robo-advisor will be able to support you. If you are in your 20s, for example, you may have goals like buying a house and saving for retirement on your list. Retirement is likely much further away when you are in your 20s and, given that it will most likely be decades until you will be drawing on retirement funds, you can be more aggressive with the funds for that purpose. Saving for a house, however, is ideally a shorter-term goal, with capital preservation being a priority that will temper your risk tolerance. With a timeline and a target final dollar amount, most robo-advisors will be able to recommend a portfolio with a risk/return profile to get you there. The best robo-advisors provide you with tools to test out different variables and scenarios, like what happens if you increase your contributions or if the market has a few years of bad returns or a prolonged recession, and help nudge you to take actions that will increase your chances of success. There are some general features that almost all investors value in a robo-advisor; depending on your experience level and account size, some features will be more important than others. Robo-advisor features that investors should evaluate are: Although cost is often the main focus, we found comprehensive goal-planning tools to be one of the most essential features of a robo-advisor. For example, whether you plan on buying a house or saving for retirement, the best robo-advisors allow you to run scenarios on your goal planning, sync outside accounts for a more comprehensive financial picture, and prompt you to improve your chances of success. Beyond that, choosing the best robo-advisor comes down to your specific financial situation. Newer, younger investors will likely value robo-advisors with low account minimums, low fees, and basic capabilities. However, investors should note that some robo-advisors have tiers of fees where the fee goes up to give access to more features, so it is important to figure out whether you need the features of a higher tier or can make do with the basics so you can compare the options properly. Investors should also look at how many of the low-cost platforms have tax-advantaged 401(k) or IRA accounts, 403(b), rollovers, or other account types that specifically apply. Similarly, a person saving for college would likely prioritize those robo-advisors that offer 529 plans or custodial accounts. For those looking for basic account management services, however, no special account is required. As your life and finances become more complex, the ability to set multiple goals with different timelines may be more important than finding the cheapest robo-advisor. As your net worth grows and life moves forward, you may be willing to pay slightly higher fees for a platform that allows you to consolidate varied financial goals like building college funds, saving for a variety of medium- and long-term purchases, and so on, in a single, robust robo-advisor that provides cash management and ongoing tax optimization. Robo-advisors are challenging to evaluate in a traditional investment sense because portfolio performance isn\u2019t a key differentiator; almost all of them seek to mimic market returns with optimal diversification. This means it largely comes down to the features you need and the quality of those features. The good news is that the robo-advisor space continues to grow, and even investors with complex finances will still find several robo-advisors to choose from to meet their investment needs. After an investor has decided that a robo-advisor is a good fit for their financial situation and determined which one to go with, the next step is to open an account. Although the requirements to open a robo-advisor account may vary between financial institutions, these steps are generally what investors can expect to follow. Fortunately, this process can be done online without needing customer support. While some investors are more concerned with choosing the best robo-advisor, there are still many people deciding between a\u00a0robo-advisor and a human financial advisor. Simply put, the benefits of a robo-advisor, at its most basic, are a portfolio designed to modern portfolio theory (MPT) standards and some level of goal-planning support for a very low management fee. In contrast, the main benefits of human financial advisors tend to fall on the relationship side more than the technology or financial efficiency side. Financial advisors come in several forms, including fee-based, commissioned, and blended (a lower fee offset by commissions on some products). One strength that human advisors have is the ability to draw out important information over the course of a conversation, whereas a robo-advisor does everything, assuming that your survey responses are accurate. Human advisors also tend to cover a wider range of topics outside of simple portfolio management. This can include taxation, budgeting, insurance, and even estate planning. Financial advisors can also help you stay on the course of a financial plan when you are tempted to deviate, especially when market conditions get tough. Over time, a financial advisor seeks to build a relationship with you to better understand your financial needs, both spoken and unspoken. There are some more key differences that are worth covering, but we should note that these are generalizations and may not be true of every financial advisor or robo-advisor. Robo-advisors, which offer financial advisors, combine both services, typically for lower than average fees. Unfortunately, some of these hybrids require higher investment balances, although not all do. While robo-advisors strictly adhere to MPT because it makes up the core of their algorithms, financial advisors have more flexibility. If a financial advisor has a clear picture of your finances, they aren\u2019t held to MPT. They may suggest concentrated exposure to certain asset classes and markets to offset concentrations in other places like savings bonds in banks, physical assets, real estate holdings, and so on. A financial advisor is also able to select investments outside the ETF universe, which is where most robo-advisors invest. This ability to make direct investments in specific segments of the market can lead to outperformance, as well as underperformance, versus the broader market. The flip side of this freedom is that commission-based financial advisors may push you towards sub-optimal funds and investments that generate commissions. A robo-advisor doesn\u2019t receive a commission and so will solely consider the fee burden and portfolio fit when selecting investments. Fee-based financial advisors avoid this issue as well, but higher AUM management fees can detract from returns. Finally, some commission-based advisors can appear to cost you nothing but end up with you having more expensive funds when cheaper, low-fee versions would have done the job. Because financial advisors have the ability to deviate from MPT, they have more variability in their performance than robo-advisors. As mentioned earlier, portfolio performance isn\u2019t a very good differentiator for robo-advisors because they typically seek to return roughly market rates through a diversified portfolio. A financial advisor can outperform or underperform the market and will likely do a bit of both over time. A robo-advisor\u2019s edge over a financial advisor is in lower fees along with clear investment decisions and rules-based portfolio management rather than performance. You may never beat the market, but you will have confidence that your portfolio is being regularly rebalanced to keep it optimized and may even be harvesting tax losses to offset taxable gains on a regular basis. As market interest rates rise, high-yield cash accounts grow in appeal. As the investment management landscape has grown increasingly competitive, many robo-advisors have made fee-free, high-yield cash accounts available through their existing suite of offerings. These offers are typically provided through the firm's association with one or more partner banks. By using multiple banks, some robo-advisors can offer more than the standard $250,000 FDIC insurance. Most of the high-yield cash accounts offer comparable returns and adjust quickly as the Fed raises or lowers rates. Wealthfront Cash Account offers three account types: individual, joint, and trust. To open an account, all you need is $1. The interest rate fluctuates with market interest rates and currently pays 5.00% on the entire balance (5.50% when you refer a friend). Through partner banks, each account receives up to $8 million in FDIC insurance ($16 million for joint accounts). Features include: Titan Smart Treasury distinguishes itself from the rest of the robo-advisors\u2019 high-yield cash accounts. In the current environment of changing interest rates, it\u2019s tough to know if you\u2019re receiving the best available return on your cash. Titan Smart Treasury solves this problem by searching daily across the available high-yield Treasury and cash options to find the best rate for you. Titan considers your tax rate as well to make certain that you\u2019re receiving the best after-tax yield, up to a 4.71% maximum. Features include: Betterment offers two cash management products, Checking and Cash Reserve, through partner banks. Betterment Cash Reserve is the high-yield cash offer, currently paying a 4.50% variable annual percentage yield (APY). Features include: Whether you are a savvy investment and money management person or not, there are benefits to using robo-advisors. In general, robo-advisor fees are lower than those of traditional financial managers who typically charge north of 1% to manage your assets. Most robo-advisory investment portfolios contain low-fee ETFs from diverse sections of the investment markets such as stocks and bonds. The investment portfolio that you select is generally created to fit your time horizon, risk tolerance, and future goals. Due to robo-advisors\u2019 structure and cost, investing with a robo-advisor can improve your investment discipline and prevent you from making impulsive investment decisions, such as selling after a market decline. You\u2019ll also save money on fees and individual investments when investing with a robo-advisor vs. a financial advisor. Many robo-advisors also offer additional features such as access to human financial advisors, cash management, margin lending, and high-yield cash accounts. Robo-advisor security is comparable with bank-level security. That means your account is protected with professional security protocols, two-factor identification, and limited access by company employees to your personal information. Some robo-advisor cash accounts are protected by the same FDIC insurance that banks use, while your investment accounts typically carry SIPC insurance, which protects you if the robo-advisor goes bankrupt. When investing in financial stock and bond markets, your investment values will go up and down. There is no insurance to protect from normal market volatility. Every robo-advisor has an investment minimum. The amounts needed to begin investing vary from $10 up to $100,000. Some also offer unlimited access to human financial advisors. The most common minimums are $100 and $500. But Charles Schwab charges a $5,000 minimum for its fee-free Intelligent Portfolios platform. If you\u2019re short on cash, then look for a robo-advisor with a low required minimum investment amount. Even if you don\u2019t have a lot to invest today, it\u2019s smart to begin investing early. As your income grows, you can increase transfers into your account and boost your long-term wealth. Robo-advisors typically charge less than 0.50% of assets under management, which is far below the traditional asset management fees charged by human advisors. Premium offerings from the platforms that are split into basic and premium will be closer to that 0.50% line. Putting this in context, a traditional human advisor will generally be double the standard robo-advisor at 1% or more. In both cases, however, there is a similar limitation in that any advisor, robo or human, can only work with the information you give as to your personal situation and financial needs. Although some of the robo-advisors we reviewed do offer some funds designed to outperform the market, the vast majority of robo-advisors are designed to match the overall returns of the market. Many of the ETFs that robo-advisors use to develop a balanced portfolio either are or have elements of index-tracking funds. Depending on the robo-advisor, your funds may also be diversified globally as well as by asset class. This means portions of the portfolio's holdings could outperform or underperform your domestic stock market due to variations in the performance of distinct market sectors, such as international stocks or fixed-income assets. Robo-advisors offered by a reputable financial institution are a cost-effective way for investors to grow their capital through an automated investing service without having high service fees eating away at their profits. The fees and entry requirements associated with these digital wealth management platforms are generally much less than those of a human financial advisor. Investors with little capital may be unable to justify the cost of a human financial advisor, let alone afford the service. Investors with taxable brokerage accounts will find that many robo-advisors offer tax-loss harvesting. This is a service that strives to sell losing assets to offset taxable gains in profitable investments. This activity is known to reduce your overall tax bill, allowing you to reinvest or keep more of your assets. Robo-advisors that lack tax-loss harvesting typically offer tax-minimization services. This is a practice of selecting assets for a taxable account which will minimize taxes. This might include selecting municipal bond funds, which deliver tax-exempt interest payments, in lieu of taxable bond funds. By automating tax-loss harvesting or tax-minimization investing strategies, investors benefit and keep more of their investment returns. We researched and reviewed 22 robo-advisor platforms to find the eight companies you see included on the list above. Below is the full list of companies we researched, along with links to individual company reviews to help you learn more before making a decision: Titan, Interactive Advisors, Sofi Automated Investing, Ally Invest Robo Portfolios, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, Fidelity Go, Wells Fargo Intuitive Investor, J.P. Morgan Automated Investing, Ellevest, Vanguard Digital Advisor, Wealthfront, Betterment, M1 Finance, Merrill Guided Investing, Sigfig, Stash, E*TRADE Core Portfolios, Axos Managed Portfolios, Acorns, Empower, Vanguard Personal Advisors, J.P. Morgan Personal Advisors Providing readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of digital wealth management companies, more commonly known as robo-advisors, is a top priority of Investopedia. We used our 2023 consumer survey to guide the research and weightings for our 2024 robo-advisor awards. To collect the data, we sent a digital survey with 64 questions to each of the 21 companies we included in our rubric. Additionally, our team of researchers verified the survey responses and collected any missing data points through online research and conversations with each company directly. The data collection process spanned from Jan. 8, to Feb. 9, 2024. We then developed a quantitative model that scored each company to rate its performance across nine major categories and 59 criteria to find the best robo-advisors. The score for each company\u2019s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria: Additionally, during our 2023 research, many of the companies we reviewed granted our team of expert writers and editors access to live accounts so they could perform hands-on testing. Through this all-encompassing data collection and review process, Investopedia has provided you with an unbiased and thorough review of the top robo-advisors.

            "title": "How the Internet Has Changed Investing",
            "content": "The Internet has been one of the most revolutionary and disruptive technologies in history, creating a major paradigm shift. It has had a profound impact on the way that consumers listen to music, watch movies, buy and sell products, and communicate. It has also had a hugely beneficial impact on investing, especially for retail investors. The wide availability of information is perhaps the biggest benefit that the Internet has had on investing. Prior to the Internet, the retail investor's best bet was to head to the local library to read financial literature, and research companies and securities such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. The other option was to contact a company directly for the latest financial report, which could prove costly in terms of postage for large financial reports and could take some time, as the investor would have to wait until the report was printed and sent by the firm's investor relation department. With the Internet, an investor can find an online company report from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website immediately after it is posted. Large financial documents can be downloaded within seconds and can be searched for keywords, topics, or specific financial statements. Companies also maintain online investor relations pages, where these same filings can be found, as can annual reports and other presentations made to investors at industry conferences. Hundreds of websites also maintain and compile financial information for investors to analyze and understand. Previously, financial intermediaries, such as brokers and investment managers, had an advantage over individual investors. This included more resources to obtain large financial reports or pay for expensive services to perform security analysis. These days, many free websites provide financial information while others charge nominal annual fees for more specialized data. The other primary benefit that the Internet has had on investing is the effect it has on lowering fees for investors. In particular, retail investors have seen a dramatic decline in the commission rates they pay to trade securities. These days, it is very common to find an online broker offering around $0 to make a common stock trade. Prior to the wide availability of discount brokers, full-service brokers were able to exert their control over the market and charge what now seem like exorbitant commission rates. A \"Money Magazine\" article from 1992, right as the Internet was just beginning to enter the consumer market, detailed that a full-service broker could charge a 2.5% commission for a stock trade. The example it provided was a $250 commission to trade 100 shares of a stock trading at $100 per share. Trading itself has benefited from electronic networks that can send trade information through Internet piping. High-frequency traders (HFT) are often the subject of much controversy and accused of contributing to above-average stock market volatility. However, these traders have also been credited with reducing bid-ask spreads, which is simply the different cost that exists when buying (the bid price) and selling (the ask price) a security. These days, the spread is down to pennies but used to be much wider and allowed brokerage firms another opportunity to take money from investor pockets and place it in their own. An academic study from the Wharton Business School back in 2000 summed up the key benefits that the Internet has had on investing in three principal factors. The first was transparency, or the ability for a much wider base of investors to analyze information and come to their own conclusions on how to properly price securities. It also defined differential pricing, which speaks to the demise of full-service brokers that charged high prices until the Internet significantly lowered the costs that the industry could charge to make financial transactions. Finally, it spoke of disintermediation, which again referred to the ability for investors to bypass old school, full-service brokers and advisors for both information and the trading of securities. Overall, the Internet has placed considerable power in the hands of individuals, and this has had a profound effect on how the investor obtains financial information. Equally importantly, it has lowered costs significantly for most financial market participants.

            "title": "How Fintech Is Disrupting Wealth Management",
            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. As I travel the country and spend time with advisors, partners, and industry colleagues, there is a lot of dialogue about how fintech is disrupting wealth management and how the advisor industry is evolving. All the chatter about evolution got me thinking about lessons from Charles Darwin, the famous naturalist who taught us that it is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the ones most responsive to change. The strong and cunning may win the short-term battles but, over the long term, Darwin\u2019s lessons suggest that those who are not able to adapt may end up on the endangered species list. In this article, I take a look at the impact financial technology has had on wealth management and what financial advisors can do to ensure they continue to thrive in a rapidly evolving industry. For years, the industry has been predicting the disruption of the financial advisor model, all the way back to when commissions were no longer regulated in the '70s, which led to the rise of the discount broker. The '80s and '90s brought forward no-load mutual funds,\u00a0and the Internet gave us online trading. And now, here in the 2000s, we have the emergence of the robo-advisor, or the computer-automated investment platform, giving cynics even more ammunition to predict that advisors will go the way of the\u00a0travel agent or taxi driver. I am much more bullish on the future of the financial advisory profession. Despite all of these financial services and technology innovations that have the potential to put human advisors to the test, their role and importance in helping investors navigate complexity and meet their goals have only increased in demand. Advisors have proven time and time again that they can adapt to these structural changes quite nicely. In fact, advisors have been able to respond to these changes by engineering new models that take advantage of commission and technology disruption. While some studies show that the number of financial advisors is expected to stay flat or grow moderately over the next five years, growth in assets managed by advisors shows that the industry is alive and well. The Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) Benchmarking Study from Charles Schwab shows that assets under management have increased steadily, with a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.5% from 2015 to 2020. Advisors should still take note of the change around them and understand how it could force them to once again prove their ability to adapt and thrive.\u00a0Each year, the fintech drums only beat louder. This has played out not just in the media, but with investment dollars. \u00a0Global investments in financial technology ventures amounted to $210 billion, in 2021, according to KPMG Pulse. The fintech industry segments include payments, cybersecurity, insurtech, wealthtech, regtech, as well as blockchain and cryptocurrency. This surge in fintech industry investment may have something to do with the rise of robo-advisors.\u00a0According to industry research, the total valuation of robo-advisors was nearly $4.51 billion in 2019, and it's expected to grow to $41.07 billion by 2027. While the robo-advisor craze is well documented, the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools hitting the wealth management landscape has made a dramatic entrance into the financial trade press. While it might be early, AI\u2019s role in financial advice is an area to watch. The launch of the predictive analytics tool from Salesforce,\u00a0Einstein, gives the industry reason to consider the role of AI in supporting advisors with where to focus or automating tasks. The same is true with IBM Watson\u2019s partnership with H&R Block. From my standpoint as an advisor fintech leader, the rapid and ongoing innovations in technology are exciting. For advisors, the more exciting innovations are about providing scale and removing behind-the-scenes work to prep for conversations with clients. Many advancements support the advisor-client relationship directly. High-net-worth investors, the sweet spot for most registered investment advisors (RIAs), are interested in digital financial advice of some sort and benefit from new developments. What does it all mean for advisors? First, it\u2019s clear that investors expect digital tools as part of their relationship with their financial advisor. They enjoy online collaboration and digital tools in other parts of their lives, so why shouldn\u2019t they when it comes to managing their wealth? With Betterment and other firms advertising in mainstream media, investors are exposed to modern, understandable, and easy-to-use tools that display performance. While user design has been commonplace in consumer packaged goods firms for years, it has only more recently become a sought-after skill in the financial services industry. Second, advisors need to ensure they are communicating with clients in new and different ways. Not all clients have time to come into the office. Clients who are still working usually expect interactions with their advisors to be efficient and direct. They also expect to be able to review information on their own at any time through a client portal and use online collaboration tools to check in with their advisor. This on-demand access provides an ultimate level of transparency. Third, there's the question of value\u2014more specifically, clients understanding the value that their advisors deliver. Many advisors offer much more than investment allocation and portfolio construction, but it\u2019s not clear whether investors understand all the \u201cextra\u201d support they are getting. Based on a 2020 generational survey, 41% of all generations surveyed would consider using a robo-advisor. However, close to half of generation Z and millennials are confident in allowing a robo-advisor to make personalized investment decisions while only a third of Generation X and 15% of young boomers would be. We could discount that since most millennials aren\u2019t facing the complexity in their financial lives as their baby boomer parents are experiencing. However, it creates yet another reason why advisors need to continue to grow their trusted relationships. After all, we know that trust and communication are huge factors in why investors select or leave an advisor. If delivered well, clients may benefit in many ways from fintech. In addition to digital experience and transparency, new competition is driving costs down, and digital tools are removing overhead and certain manual processes for advisors. Case in point: Charles Schwab Corp.\u00a0offers robo+advisor product, Schwab Intelligent Advisory, at 28 basis points, or $3,600 maximum, per year. With a minimum of $5,000 investment, the product includes tax-loss harvesting and automatic rebalancing. The premium offering targets mass affluent investors with a minimum of $25,000 to invest, but it still sends a message to the industry that costs matter. My advice to advisors is to grab on to technology that helps you be more efficient and get closer to clients. After all, technology, when used well, can help you with the seemingly daunting challenges facing all advisors today\u2014running an efficient and profitable business, demonstrating your value, and leveraging tools for growth. Darwin\u2019s advice remains sound. This article was written by Dave Welling, CEO of Mercer Advisors and former\u00a0managing director and co-general manager of SS&C Advent.

            "title": "The Bloomberg Terminal: Step By Step",
            "content": "Bloomberg is synonymous with investment information in many corners of the finance world. According to the company, \"The Bloomberg Terminal revolutionized an industry by bringing transparency to financial markets. More than four decades on, it remains at the cutting edge of innovation and information delivery \u2014 with fast access to news, data, unique insight and trading tools helping leading decision makers turn knowledge into action.\" So not only does it have a news and media outlet, it also has a software/hardware system that most, if not all, professional money managers use. The Bloomberg terminal is both a hardware and software system. It includes the Bloomberg Keyboard which has special color-coded keys.\u00a0The color coding is as follows: The market sectors toggled to using the yellow keys include: Source:\u00a0Bloomberg Any and all historical or current information related to these market sectors is available\u00a0through this system. Because of the breadth and depth of availability, it's always a good idea to target in on specific functions and information. Doing so can make the terminal less overwhelming. The system also has\u00a0innumerable capabilities. Users can pull up technical and fundamental\u00a0graphs of all types\u00a0including money flows and margin trends, data comparing companies to each other or indices, and company-specific information\u00a0related to every part of the capital structure. Bloomberg's first keyboard, called The Chiclet, was hand-assembled and released in 1983. In an attempt to dwindle\u00a0down the tremendous information base into\u00a0available functions that are typically used every day, we compiled a list of five key categories. Type \"N\" then hit for general news. To access the top business or general headlines, type TOP and hit.\u00a0The screen will appear with a toolbar at the top, a command line where new commands can be typed, the main or function area which contains the information required, and an information panel at the bottom. In the EQUITY function (F8), a command can be entered to locate a description of the company, its price or trade data (current and historical), news, graphs, corporate structure, valuation, credit ratings, capital structure, comparison companies, and regulatory filings.\u00a0You can also review analyst recommendations, earnings estimates, and bond information. For example, to look up a company's earnings estimates, click the ticker symbol, EQUITY, then hit GO. Deal data and specifics can be found using the\u00a0MA function.\u00a0If you're looking for a specific company, type the company name in the \"Company Search\" box at the top.\u00a0The output provides all the terms of the deals. To build a list of securities that meet specified criteria, type EQS then hit GO.\u00a0From here, you can select a list of criteria with specified parameters.\u00a0Available criteria are listed under categories related to exchanges, sectors, indices, domicile, descriptions, geography, and fundamental characteristics.\u00a0An output of results will be generated, and these results can be changed by selecting Edit Criteria.\u00a0This output, like many outputs in Bloomberg, can also be exported to Excel. To analyze industries from a top-down perspective, type BI and hit GO.\u00a0Everything from high-level news, industry primers, earnings, and valuations, to more specific data can be found here. The Bloomberg terminal\u00a0is a costly system and primarily available to professional investors.\u00a0Most individual investors don't have access to it. But you may be able to find a terminal at a public or university library. If you can't get your hands on one, though, there are publicly available substitutes that provide similar data. Keep in mind that the depth and breadth of the information these alternative sources offer may be lacking. That means you may have to put together your own mosaic of information. The year the first Bloomberg Terminal was released that ran on a customer-provided PC. For example, you can easily find financial news on many financial websites.\u00a0Company information can be located via the SEC Edgar system for\u00a0regulatory\u00a0filings or company websites.\u00a0Investment screening can be accomplished using websites like finviz.com or msn.com. M&A information, on the other hand, is a bit more complex to locate.\u00a0Some deal data can be found online, but most require a subscription fee.\u00a0Similarly, industry data can be compiled from different sources including independent analysts for a fee. For a standard license, a Bloomberg terminal is around $2,000 per month or $2,400 per year. The Bloomberg Terminal was at one point an actual standalone device. But nowadays, subscribers can download and run the software on PC or Mac. Bloomberg's software is available to anyone who wants to use it. However, due to its expensive cost, it is mostly used by professional traders. Bloomberg is an invaluable tool for investors primarily because it provides data in one place and allows users to configure the data in various ways to analyze and review trends, compare to other companies and industries and most importantly to follow a historical path so that analysis of an investment can be detailed and all-encompassing.

            "title": "The Most Popular Mobile Payment Apps",
            "content": "Mobile payment apps like Apple Pay and Venmo have grown exponentially since launch. Users will find solace in their ease of use and exceptional security. Despite the power behind such names, the original and most used mobile payments app was developed by a business model well-removed from the tech giants in Silicon Valley. Starbucks (SBUX) has a compelling story to tell about how your life will be better when you tap and pay, instead of pulling out a card or even cash. The free Starbucks mobile-pay app allows you to order on your way, and then just walk in (or drive-thru) and pick up your order without waiting in line. Their mobile payments app had nearly 22 million active users as of the end of 2020. The app was rolled out to all stores in the U.S. in 2011. Meanwhile, other merchants have been upgrading their credit card payment processing devices they use in order to enable more secure EMV technology, and many smartphones are ready for tap-and-pay use. There has been a surge in mobile payment services beyond Apple and Venmo. PayPal bought Braintree in 2013, which had purchased Venmo the year before. Meanwhile, there's Zelle, Cash App, and Google Pay. Many payment apps are default choices\u00a0depending on which phone you have, and they work much the same. You download the free app, upload your credit or debit cards and \u201ctap to pay\u201d with your phone at any retailer that accepts that service. PayPal works the same way, and with the same card reader, if the merchant has signed up to accept PayPal payments. PayPal is not as widely available in brick-and-mortar stores. Due to the ease of taking or cloning phone data, there remains one big question in consumers\u2019 minds\u2014how secure are mobile payments? It seems that\u00a0the big players have spent a lot of time and effort making sure that mobile payments are more secure than using a physical card. First of all,\u00a0a merchant will never see your credit card number or the authorization code from the back of your card or even your name. And, when\u00a0you make a purchase, instead of your credit card number being used,\u00a0a one-time encrypted number is generated\u2014a token\u2014to authorize the purchase. It expires shortly afterward. Even if your phone is lost or stolen, there are layers of protection. Mobile wallets are behind a lock screen, requiring a PIN number or fingerprint authentication to use. So access is restricted. What\u2019s more, your credit or debit card\u00a0numbers are not stored on the phone. Finally, there are features that the companies urge you to activate in case you lose your phone:\u00a0Android\u00a0Pay users, for instance,\u00a0are warned to turn on the Android Device Manager so that the phone can be located if it\u2019s lost or stolen, and locked remotely if needed. For Apple\u00a0Pay, the Find My iPhone feature lets you suspend the mobile wallet remotely. The American attitude is in sharp contrast to that of Chinese consumers, who have embraced cash-free living. Millions of Chinese consumers use mobile payments. They use their mobile phones to pay for taxis and meal delivery, in Walmart stores, and at mom-and-pop market stands. Alipay, owned by Alibaba, is China's dominant mobile payment service. In China and in other developing nations, where many have never used a traditional bank, many newly minted consumers are avoiding banks and substituting a mobile payment service. Alipay users can deposit their money in a money market account that\u00a0pays the investor higher interest rates than traditional bank savings accounts.

            "content": "Adam Hayes, Ph.D., CFA, is a financial writer with 15+ years Wall Street experience as a derivatives trader. Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master's in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology. He is a CFA charterholder as well as holding FINRA Series 7, 55 & 63 licenses. He currently researches and teaches economic sociology and the social studies of finance at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. sebastianosecondi\u00a0/ Getty Images The FMX Futures Exchange, part of brokerage and financial technology BGC Group, Inc. (BGC), is a futures exchange created to challenge the dominance of the CME Group Inc. The FMX Futures Exchange, part of brokerage and financial technology BGC Group, Inc. (BGC), is a futures exchange created to challenge the dominance of the CME Group Inc. (CME), which had record trading in 2023 and early 2024. Backed by a firm with deep pockets, partial equity ownership from some of the world's top investment banks, and a clearing partnership with LCH, the London-based clearing giant, FMX is well-placed to be the first firm in memory able to challenge CME's near-total hold over U.S. futures trading. FMX's futures exchange will be a combined platform for futures on U.S. Treasury, repurchase agreements (repos), and foreign exchange (FX) trades. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved FMX in January 2024, and it offers cash U.S. Treasurys and spot currencies. The goal is to provide a one-stop shop for traders looking to buy and sell various financial products. FMX says it will add secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) futures in the third quarter of 2024, followed by Treasury futures in early 2025. The buildup of the exchange could take a few years, and FMX hopes to attract early adopters with low or no fees in the first year. \"We hope a year from when we open, we will have all the players on the playing field and then it will truly begin,\" said Howard Lutnick, BGC's chair and CEO. It won't be until 2026, he said, \"when everybody has all of the ecosystem completely connected,\" that FMX should be expected to start making a major dent in futures markets. As these products suggest, FMX, for now, is not aiming for retail investors, unlike various online platforms such as Kalshi, but looks to build out with institutional and larger investors first. Led by Lutnick, a significant player in the financial services industry, FMX was formed by BGC, which also owns the CX Futures Exchange, which offers weather derivatives. While FMX is new in the exchange space, BGC dates back to 1945 and has since grown into a major brokerage and fintech firm, selling market data for fixed-income securities, foreign exchange, and derivatives. BGC has expanded in recent years by buying up electronic trading platforms and brokerage firms. This led to the Fenics technology platform, designed for trading and other market operations across various asset classes. The Fenics platform comprises electronic trading systems, market data services, and other financial tools for institutional traders. There's good reason not to wager against the success of FMX: BGC has an impressive history of creating successful electronic marketplaces, such as eSpeed, Fenics UST, Fenics FX, and Fenics MidFX. Several factors drove the creation of FMX Exchange. BGC says it saw an opening for increased competition, greater market efficiency, and more integration with financial technology in the market. BGC thinks there's market share to be gained from challenging the dominance of established players in the U.S. Treasury and SOFR futures markets. There's little doubt their main target is CME, whose revenues doubled between 2020 and 2023. However, the CME itself has competition, including the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Cboe Global Markets (CBOE), Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR), and other markets for derivatives trading. BGC's success with Fenics UST, which took a chunk out of the CME's significant market share in the wholesale U.S. Treasury market, showed it could have success taking on the derivatives giant. It's part of the reason analysts are paying close attention: BGC's exchanges already have deep liquidity pools (lots of trading), an extensive network of institutional clients and partners, and the scalable fintech it needs to compete. For the FMX Futures Exchange to succeed, it'll need to be a viable competitor to the CME's four derivatives exchanges: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, NYMEX, and COMEX. To do so, FMX will need to show it can provide traders with low-cost, low-latency access to key U.S. futures markets. The decision to focus on U.S. Treasury and SOFR futures was based on their size and importance. Treasury futures are among the most actively traded futures contracts globally, and the transition from LIBOR to SOFR as a benchmark interest rate created a market opportunity. By offering an alternative in these markets, FMX Exchange seeks to attract a significant share of trading volume and set the ground for becoming a major competitor for the CME, ICE, and other derivatives exchanges. To ramp up for this, BGC Group invested heavily in developing new trading technologies, risk management systems, and clearing infrastructure, which manages and finalizes transactions after they've gone through. The company also lined up secure partnerships with key market participants, including global investment banks and market-making firms, giving it a significant boost for the exchange's launch. The FMX Futures Exchange will offer interest rate and FX futures products, focusing first on the U.S. Treasury and the SOFR markets.\u00a0The exchange will also trade futures contracts on two-year, three-year, five-year, 10-year, ultra-10-year, 20-year, 30-year, and ultra-30-year U.S. Treasurys, providing various options for managing interest rate risk exposure. It will also have three-month SOFR futures contracts, targeting the growing demand for SOFR-based instruments in the wake of the LIBOR transition. The transition became necessary once LIBOR's credibility came undone after manipulation scandals and a decline in the volume of transactions used to calculate it. While LIBOR is based on the rates at which major banks lend to each other unsecured in five currencies and for several terms (overnight to 12 months), SOFR is based on actual overnight loans in the U.S. Treasury repo market, which means secured transactions. If there's ever a time to enter a market, it's when clients are changing systems and processes already. FMX says its finished platform will pull together the following: FMX Futures Exchange plans to offer lower exchange fees than its competitors to attract market participants. The fees, it says, will be simple and volume-based, which should translate into lower transaction costs. In addition, the exchange will have smaller tick sizes (minimum price changes), which could result in tighter bid-ask spreads and more granularity on prices. Market participants will also have the ability to trade cash and futures. Trading both on a single exchange enables participants to offset positions or hedge across these products, reducing capital requirements and improving liquidity. LCH will also act as the central counterparty for transactions. This means that LCH will be the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer, meaning that as an investor. So, you don't have to worry about getting paid for your asset or paying and not getting the asset. Having LCH on board bolsters FMX's credibility as an ongoing concern, not just the trustworthiness of trading within FMX. In addition, LCH will provide the benefit of cross-margining, which allows participants to offset their positions across different products, leading to lower margin requirements. This, in turn, frees up investor capital for other uses. Along with its investment bank partners, the LCH deal gives FMX legitimacy to proceed, attracting more liquidity and trading to the exchange while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. This is all the more important given that the futures exchange market has high barriers to entry, making it difficult for new players to gain a foothold. The FMX Exchange received regulatory approval to operate in early 2024 from the CFTC. The exchange is set to launch over 2024 and 2025. The exchange's technology should give FMX Exchange users a fast and predictable trading experience. Users can access the market via different methods, including graphical user interface, FIX API, and binary API systems. The trading platform should ensure all trades are final and anonymous, eliminating the chance for a last look. FMX will use the Fenics trading technology developed by BGC Group. Fenics is already used for order matching and execution, and it is offered for use with its U.S. Treasury, repo, and FX products. CME dominates futures trading and clearing in the U.S., owning the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, NYMEX, and COMEX. Collectively, the CME's exchanges offer futures on everything from agricultural goods and events to financial instruments like interest rates and stock indexes. Competitors include ICE, a major player in futures for agricultural and energy commodities and global currencies. Nasdaq also operates a small futures exchange, listing futures and options in key energy benchmarks and commodities contracts. The CBOE Global Markets, primarily known for options trading, also has some futures trading, primarily through its popular VIX futures, which track market volatility. No. While both exchanges are owned and operated by BGC Group, they are two distinct platforms, each serving different markets. The FMX Futures Exchange focuses listing and clearing exchange-rate and FX futures products, while the CX exchange offers trading mainly in over-the-counter weather derivatives. In terms of trading volume, products listed, and open interest, CME Group consistently ranks as the largest futures exchange globally. In the first quarter of 2024, CME Group reported an average daily volume of 7.4 million contracts, setting a record. After regulatory approval to operate in 2024, the FMX Futures Exchange is to launch in 2024. A subsidiary of BGC group, FMX Futures will leverage BGC's Fenics trading technology, existing partnerships, and client base to launch a challenge to the CME Group's dominance in interest-rate related futures markets, primarily in Treasurys and SOFR futures. With the backing of global investment banks and market-making firms, the FMX Futures Exchange could reshape the competitive landscape in these crucial markets.

Investopedia / Mira Norian Embedded finance takes banking and other financial services and puts them in nonfinancial apps and elsewhere. Embedded finance is the term for integrating banking and other financial services into nonfinancial apps and services. Companies are merging banking, lending, insurance, and investment services with their customer offerings through application programming interfaces (APIs) linked to financial partners. Embedded finance is, in a sense, nothing new: Buy now, pay later (BNPL) is based on invisible third-party loans given at the point of sale. However, with APIs and smartphones ubiquitous, consumers get their banking services wherever they are, while companies can gain greater loyalty and more revenue streams from their customers. To help us understand the shift marked by embedded finance, we contacted Joris Hensen, founder and co-lead, and Brigitte K\u00f6tting, communications manager at Deutsche Bank's (DB) API program. They have published academic work on the practice while helping to lead its use at one of Europe's largest banks. \"Embedded finance has great potential to empower 'unbanked,' target groups,\" even though, they told us via email, noting there still needs to be widescale use cases for this. \"Whether it's offering banking services through mobile wallets or providing microfinance options, e.g., within agricultural supply chains\u2014embedded finance can help ... foster [r] economic growth.\" Embedded finance puts checking and savings accounts, loans, insurance, debit cards, savings, and investment tools into the platforms of companies that typically don\u2019t deal in finance. This results from partnerships with technology partners and traditional financial institutions. Inserting financial products or services into nonfinancial company transactions isn\u2019t new. For example, many car companies began offering direct-to-consumer auto loans and financing options decades ago, and store-branded charge cards for department stores and other retailers are as old as mass-market credit services. However, embedded finance has gained prominence, first as a term in the mid- to late 2010s and then through changes in fintech and retailing apps. These include competition from innovative players, evolving customer expectations, the unbundling of traditional banking functions for many, the prominence of APIs and software as a service (SaaS) models, and the pursuit of new market opportunities. By enabling nonfinancial companies to incorporate financial services directly and seamlessly into their platforms and connect with fintech and banks through APIs, proponents of embedded finance say it\u2019s a significant departure from both the conventional fintech model and traditional banking practices. If so, it would have profound implications for the future of banking and the fintech industry, underscoring a significant shift in how financial services are delivered and experienced. To do that, it would need to be different from the following: The point is captured by thinking of banking and other financial services as offered less by independent entities with separate locations and different apps than as part of one consumer experience. Let\u2019s turn to how it works and some examples to see how embedded finance could be a new phase beyond its predecessors. Platforms with embedded finance gain access to data they can use to personalize each experience. But it could put that data at risk, so when you use these services, treat them with the enhanced online security you would use for banks and other sensitive transactions. Four fundamental shifts are driving the emergence of embedded finance: For Hensen and K\u00f6tting, \"Embedded finance is [to be] understood as a transformation of the bank as such...This is ultimately where the biggest transformation takes place: the customization of banking services to the needs of a partner or the requirements of a product. In the end, only fundamental flexibilization will support these developments and make it possible to meet upcoming regulatory requirements, such as the EU's planned Open Finance Framework.\" Embedded finance, a rapidly evolving practice, is reshaping how businesses integrate financial services into their operations. Here\u2019s an overview of some of the ways that it\u2019s being used. Embedded banking seamlessly integrates banking services into nonfinancial companies\u2019 platforms. For instance, Shopify\u2019s (SHOP) Shopify Balance provides business banking and card services within its platform, streamlining financial management for ecommerce businesses. Uber (UBER) has also developed an embedded banking ecosystem, offering its drivers instant earnings deposits and specialized debit cards. Hensen and K\u00f6tting walked us through how Deutsche Bank is implementing these practices throughout its services. \"Our embedded finance initiative initially focussed on the account opening processes for Deutsche Bank's brands,\" they said. Deutsche Bank first standardized its systems across the organization. In their Wealth Management division, they created an investment API that family offices can integrate with their software.\u00a0For small and medium-sized business customers, they now offer db Smart Access. \"With this product, they can easily integrate their business account into their IT landscape,\" they said. \"We have received a lot of valuable feedback and suggestions for new functions that we are working on right now. After all, that is also part of embedded finance: taking feedback into account and learning how we can further expand our portfolio.\" Embedded payments integrate this process into a platform or app, making transactions more convenient for users. For example, Uber and Lyft (LYFT) have simplified the payment process by allowing users to complete transactions within the app and integrating themselves into apps like PayPal and Venmo\u200b. In addition, Housecall Pro has launched business expense cards for home service professionals, offering financial management from their software platform\u200b\u200b. \u200bSimilarly, the Starbucks (SBUX) app enables customers to order and pay via their phones while earning reward points\u200b\u200b. Companies use branded cards to simplify payments, such as the PayPal (PYPL) cash card, which provides immediate access to PayPal account balances. These differ from traditional store-branded charge cards, as they not only earn loyalty rewards but also draw directly from stockpiled balances held via the app. Conversely, Amazon.com (AMZN) lets customers use the JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) rewards program to pay for purchases on its site. \u200bThese cards often carry the branding of the company and can be used just like regular debit or credit cards for transactions at other companies, offering a more integrated financial experience for users. Embedded lending offers immediate loan options at the point of sale, enhancing the customer\u2019s purchasing power. Popular examples include BNPL services like Klarna and Afterpay, which let consumers split online purchases into smaller monthly payments\u200b. Financial platforms like Robinhood (HOOD), Cash App, and Acorns integrate investment services into their apps so that users can buy, sell, and exchange stocks or crypto without a separate investment account or advisor.\u200b \u200bThis approach democratizes and clarifies investing for average consumers by embedding it into platforms they already use for other financial services. Embedded insurance streamlines the process of purchasing insurance by combining it with the purchase of a product or service. For instance, Tesla (TSLA) offers an insurance program that customers can buy when buying a vehicle\u200b. \u200bAirlines and online travel companies like Expedia (EXPE), Booking Holdings (BKNG), and Hotels.com also provide travel insurance during the booking process, making it more convenient for customers. There are three primary categories of companies enabling embedded financial services: technology providers; banking (balance sheet) firms; and embedded finance distributors. These firms create the digital infrastructure that connects financial institutions and the companies embedding financial services. Here are the elements of what this takes: By reducing the complexities of embedded finance through APIs and infrastructure, technology providers make it easier for nonfinancial companies without the staff or in-house know-how to offer these services. These regulated, licensed financial institutions originate core banking, credit, and insurance products and provide the underlying balance sheet that enables nonbanks to embed customized financial services. They also offer safekeeping and other banking services on behalf of end users. These include the following: Balance sheet providers bankroll and assume the risks for the financial products that technology companies then carry out with customized APIs and other tools for their distribution partners. The following firms integrate financial services into customer offerings for distribution to the following: Traditional retailers Retailers embed finance to move beyond simple ecommerce transactions. For example, through its partners, Walmart (WMT) offers check cashing, bill pay, credit card, BNPL, and money transfer services in its stores and apps. Home Depot (HD) provides consumer credit cards for all its customers and professional credit lines for contractors as part of their purchases. Software firms SaaS companies can incorporate tailored financial tools for other businesses. Here are some examples: Marketplaces and platforms Transaction hubs for gig workers and digital matching embed access to wages, lending, wallet, and investing tools like these: Telecom companies Telecoms offer customers mobile financial services such as these: Original equipment manufacturers Product makers incorporate specialized financing programs into their internet-connected devices: Behavioral economic advantages One-step financial shopping Enhanced security Streamlines user experience Cultivates trust and brand loyalty Increased financial access Expanding portfolio of services Behavioral economic pitfalls Complexity Customer overload Increased need for customer support Loss of focus Security and privacy pitfalls Regulatory compliance Reliance on third parties Reputational risk Trust erosion In addition to providing new revenue streams and profit possibilities, embedded finance has features that can benefit both the provider and the consumer: For businesses and consumers, there are risks like overextending their reach, integration complexities, changes to the relevant laws and regulations, liability for partners\u2019 actions, data privacy concerns, increasing security vulnerabilities, and turning customers off by monetizing every possible interaction and further extending checkout time with more and more checkboxes and opt-outs if not managed right. Here are some further potential drawbacks: Open banking refers specifically to banks providing third-party financial services access to customer data and account functions through APIs. It enables external fintech companies to build applications and services around banking data to deliver more value, convenience, and personalized offerings to account holders. Open banking (also known as banking-as-a-service), therefore, deals with banks opening up regulatory-compliant services and data flows. Embedded finance focuses on nonbanks integrating financial services using open APIs and infrastructure. So, open banking provides the foundations for embedded finance by enabling regulated back-end financial institutions to distribute capabilities, while embedded finance is about extending financial tools into new distribution channels. Decentralized finance, often shortened to DeFi, aims to use blockchains, smart contracts, and cryptocurrency to make financial systems more open, global, and accessible without the need for central authorities through automated processes. DeFi, therefore, seeks to build alternative financial rails using decentralized technologies, which some proponents think removes intermediaries between a customer and someone else providing services. Rather than taking away middle parties, embedded finance seeks to embed financial services into nonfinancial contexts via centralized or proprietary technologies like APIs. It essentially enables nonfinancial companies to offer white-labeled financial products from licensed traditional financial institutions. Estimates given can be within a broad range, often with proponents offering numbers that count what would seem like all future financial transactions in the trillions. More solidly, according to Global Market Insights, the market was valued at $58 billion in 2022 and is estimated to register a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 29% until 2032, potentially reaching $730.5 billion by 2032\u200b. Another perspective from Grand View Research estimates the global embedded finance market size to grow at a CAGR of 32.2% through 2030. Embedded finance could be a significant shift in the financial services landscape, seamlessly integrating financial products and services into nonfinancial environments. This integration allows companies traditionally outside the finance sector to offer banking, lending, insurance, and investment services directly through their apps and platforms. Enabled by the use of APIs from specialized providers, embedded finance not only broadens product portfolios and enhances customer convenience but also opens new revenue streams for businesses. The trend signifies a departure from traditional banking and fintech models, embedding financial services into everyday consumer and business interactions. As a modern financial phenomenon, embedded finance is driven by the digitalization of commerce, advances in technological integration, and shifts in consumer behavior. Ecommerce, ride-hailing apps, and freelance marketplaces, for example, are embedding wallet, payment, and wealth management tools into their platforms. The rise of APIs and SaaS models has made these integrations feasible and caters to consumers comfortable with nontraditional financial service providers. The implications for the future of banking and fintech are profound, highlighting potentially a major transformation in the delivery and experience of financial services.

            "content": "Mission Investors Exchange (MIE) Is a Nonprofit That Supports Impact Investing Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Mission Investors Exchange (MIE) is a nonprofit association that supports and connects foundations and other philanthropic organizations engaged in impact investing. MIE focuses on \u201cmission investing,\u201d which aims to generate positive social and environmental impact alongside financial returns. MIE provides a platform that facilitates impact investing. With more than 250 member organizations, it offers resources, tools, and events to help mission-driven investors navigate the complexities of impact investing: MIE was established in 2005 as a network and learning community for foundations and other organizations engaged in impact investing. It was founded by institutions that wanted to use investment capital to create social and environmental impact alongside financial returns. The foundations behind the original funding for MIE are a who\u2019s who of the foundation world, including the Annie E. Casey Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the George Gund Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Meyer Memorial Trust, the David & Lucile Packard Foundation, and the Prudential Foundation. At first, MIE focused on providing a platform for sharing information and fostering collaboration among mission-driven investors. It did so by establishing conferences, workshops, and networking events where members could share their experiences and best practices from the field of impact investing. Later, MIE expanded its activities to include research, advocacy, and the development of resources and tools to support its members. The organization has thus helped to deepen the public and investment community\u2019s knowledge and practice of mission investing, as this has become a well-recognized and sustainable approach for helping to achieve social and environmental goals. MIE has supplemented its activities by collaborating with other organizations and networks in the United States and internationally. By fostering strategic partnerships, MIE has worked to build a broader network of those committed to aligning financial resources with mission objectives. The MIE offers three types of membership: These are some of the benefits of MIE membership: The annual membership fee depends on the size and type of organization. The landscape in investing has changed as entrepreneurs, investors, and philanthropists in the last two decades have been looking beyond the traditional model of maximizing profits while separately allocating charitable contributions. Instead, they\u2019re looking for investment avenues that can do both simultaneously. Into this mix arrived mission-related investing (MRI), which organizations may adopt for different reasons\u2014whether guided by political or societal goals, their philanthropic efforts, or to have another tool for their charitable giving. Also known as mission-driven investing or program-related investing, MRI attempts to use financial capital to generate a positive social and environmental impact while pursuing financial returns. Some distinctions are helpful, given the varied acronyms related to MRI in the investment community. Unlike traditional forms of investing, the impact investing of MRI has a dual purpose: the financial gains of traditional investing along with positive social or environmental effects. While MRI\u2019s mission investing shares similarities with socially responsible investing (SRI), which employs negative or positive screening of publicly traded stocks\u2014such as steering clear of companies involved in the tobacco, alcohol, and gambling sectors or, conversely, favoring those producing socially beneficial goods or services\u2014impact investing goes a step further. Where SRI is geared toward an already-available menu of options, impact investing seeks opportunities to invest in organizations, projects, or funds that might yield meaningful financial returns and measurable social or environmental change. MRI is also different from environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, which primarily focuses on a company\u2019s governance practices and its social and ecological footprint, and doesn\u2019t necessarily aim for a measurable, positive impact. In summary, while both ESG and SRI emphasize ethical considerations in investing, they differ in their focus and methods: These are some key characteristics of MRI: MIE is a membership-based organization that provides a platform for foundations and other mission-driven investors to connect, collaborate, and learn from one another. Yes, individuals can participate. While once an area mainly reserved for institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), the landscape is changing. Many financial institutions now offer impact investment funds geared toward retail investors, sometimes with relatively low minimum investment requirements. Also, online platforms have emerged that specialize in connecting individual investors with impact investing opportunities. The risks of and limitations to MIE include the scope of the Mission Investors Exchange\u2019s work, which is confined to impact or MRI investing. The MIE also is constrained by its own capacity and funding. It\u2019s highly dependent on membership engagement. Finally, impact investing remains an evolving field, and MIE\u2019s resources and knowledge base may not always keep pace with rapid developments in the field. MIE is a membership organization that supports foundations and mission-driven organizations in pursuing impact investing, a type of investing that differs from ESG and SRI. MIE provides a platform for networking, knowledge sharing, and collaboration among its members, offering resources, events, and educational opportunities to improve the effectiveness of mission-related investing. By fostering connections, advocating for enabling policies, and promoting best practices, MIE aims to strengthen the field of impact investing and drive positive social and environmental change.

            "title": "Financial Technology (Fintech): Its Uses and Impact on Our Lives",
            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. Financial technology (better known as fintech) is used to describe new technology that seeks to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services. \u200b\u200b\u200bAt its core, fintech is utilized to help companies, business owners,\u00a0and consumers better manage their financial operations, processes, and lives. It is composed of specialized software and algorithms that are used on\u00a0computers and smartphones. Fintech, the word, is a shortened combination of \u201cfinancial technology.\u201d When fintech\u00a0emerged in the 21st\u00a0century, the term was\u00a0initially applied to the technology employed at the backend systems of established\u00a0financial institutions, such as banks. From 2018 or so to 2022, there was a shift to consumer-oriented services. Fintech now includes different sectors and industries such as education, retail banking, fundraising and nonprofit, and investment management, to name a few. Fintech\u00a0also includes\u00a0the development and use of cryptocurrencies,\u00a0such as\u00a0Bitcoin. While that segment of fintech\u00a0may see the most headlines, the big money still lies in the traditional global\u00a0banking\u00a0industry and its multitrillion-dollar\u00a0market capitalization. Paige McLaughlin / Investopedia Broadly, the term \u201cfinancial technology\u201d can apply to any innovation in how people transact business, from the invention of digital money to double-entry bookkeeping. Since the internet revolution, financial technology has grown explosively. You likely use some element of fintech on a daily basis. Some examples include transferring money from your debit account to your checking account via your iPhone, sending money to a friend through Venmo, or managing investments through an online broker. According to EY\u2019s\u00a02019 Global FinTech Adoption Index, two-thirds of consumers utilize at least two or more fintech services, and those consumers are increasingly aware of fintech as a part of their daily lives. The most talked-about (and most funded) fintech startups share the same characteristic: They are designed to challenge,\u00a0and eventually\u00a0take over, traditional financial services providers by being more nimble, serving an underserved segment of the population, or providing faster or better service. For example, financial company Affirm seeks to cut credit card companies out of the online shopping process by offering a way for consumers to secure immediate, short-term loans for purchases. While rates can be high, Affirm claims to offer a way for consumers with poor or no credit a way to secure credit and build\u00a0their credit history. Similarly, Better Mortgage seeks to streamline the home mortgage process with a digital-only offering that can reward users with a verified pre-approval letter within 24 hours of applying. GreenSky\u00a0seeks to link home improvement borrowers with banks by helping consumers avoid lenders and save on interest by offering zero-interest promotional periods. For consumers with poor or no credit, Tala offers consumers in the developing world microloans by doing a deep data dig on their smartphones for\u00a0their transaction history and seemingly unrelated things, such as\u00a0what mobile games they play. Tala seeks to give such consumers better options than local banks, unregulated lenders, and other microfinance\u00a0institutions. In short, if you have ever wondered why some aspect of\u00a0your financial life was so unpleasant (such as applying for a mortgage with a traditional lender) or felt like it wasn\u2019t quite the right fit, fintech\u00a0probably has (or seeks to have) a solution\u00a0for you. In its most basic form, fintech unbundles financial services into individual offerings that are often easier to use. The combination of streamlined offerings with technology allows fintech companies to be more efficient and cut down on costs associated with each transaction. If one word can describe how many fintech innovations have affected traditional trading, banking, financial advice, and products, it\u2019s \u201cdisruption\u201d\u2014a word you have likely heard in commonplace conversations or the media. Financial products and services that were once the realm of branches, salespeople, and desktops are now more commonly found on mobile devices. For example, the mobile-only stock trading app Robinhood charges no fees for trades, and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending sites like Prosper Marketplace, LendingClub, and OnDeck\u00a0promise to reduce rates by opening up competition for loans to broad market forces. Business loan providers such as Kabbage, Lendio, Accion, and Funding Circle (among others) offer startup and established businesses easy, fast platforms to secure working capital. Oscar, an online insurance startup, received $165 million in funding in March 2018. Such significant funding rounds are not unusual and occur globally for fintech startups. This shift to a digital-first mindset has pushed several traditional institutions to invest heavily in similar products. For example, investment bank Goldman Sachs launched consumer lending platform Marcus in 2016 in an effort to enter the fintech space. That said, many tech-savvy industry watchers warn that keeping apace of fintech-inspired innovations requires more than just ramped-up tech spending.\u00a0Rather, competing with lighter-on-their-feet startups requires a significant change in thinking, processes, decision making, and even overall corporate structure. New technologies, such as machine learning/artificial intelligence (AI), predictive behavioral analytics, and data-driven marketing, will take the guesswork and habit out of financial decisions. \u201cLearning\u201d apps will not only learn the habits of users but also engage users in learning games to make their automatic, unconscious spending and saving decisions better. Fintech is also a keen adapter of automated customer service technology, utilizing chatbots and AI interfaces to assist customers with basic tasks and keep down staffing costs. Fintech\u00a0is also being leveraged to fight fraud by leveraging information about payment history to flag transactions that are outside the norm. Since the mid-2010s, fintech has exploded, with startups receiving billions in venture funding (some of which have become unicorns) and incumbent financial firms either snatching up new ventures or building out their own fintech offerings. North America\u00a0still produces most of the fintech startups, with Asia a relatively close second, followed by Europe. Some of the most active areas of fintech innovation include or revolve around the following areas (among others): There are four broad categories of users for fintech: Trends toward mobile banking, increased information, data, more accurate analytics, and decentralization of access will create opportunities for all four groups to interact in unprecedented ways. As for consumers, the younger you are, the more likely it will be that you are aware of and can accurately describe what fintech is. Consumer-oriented fintech is mostly targeted toward Gen Z and millennials, given the huge size and rising earning potential of these generations. When it comes to businesses, before the adoption of fintech, a business owner or startup would have\u00a0gone to a\u00a0bank to secure financing or startup capital. If they intended to accept credit card payments, they would have to establish a relationship with a credit provider and even install infrastructure, such as a landline-connected card reader. Now, with mobile technology, those hurdles are\u00a0a thing of the past. Financial services are among the most heavily regulated sectors in the world. As such, regulation has emerged as the number one concern among governments as fintech companies take off. According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, while fintech firms create new opportunities and capabilities for companies and consumers, they are also creating new risks to be aware of. \u201cData privacy and regulatory arbitrage\u201d are the main concerns noted by the Treasury. In its most recent report in November 2022, the Treasury called for enhanced oversight of consumer financial activities, specifically when it comes to nonbank firms. Regulation is also a problem in the emerging world of cryptocurrencies. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are a form of fundraising that allows startups to raise capital directly from lay investors. In most countries, they are unregulated and have become fertile ground for scams and frauds. Regulatory uncertainty for ICOs has also allowed entrepreneurs to slip security tokens disguised as utility tokens past the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to avoid fees and compliance costs. Because of the diversity of offerings in fintech and the disparate industries it touches, it is difficult to formulate a single and comprehensive approach to these problems. For the most part, governments have used existing regulations and, in some cases, customized them to regulate fintech. Fintech has been applied to many areas of finance. Here are just a few examples. No. While banks and startups have created useful fintech applications around basic banking (e.g., checking and savings accounts, bank transfers, credit/debit cards, and loans), many other fintech areas that have more to do with personal finance, investing, or payments (among others) have grown in popularity. Fintechs make money in different ways depending on their specialty. Banking fintechs, for example, may generate revenue from fees, loan interest, and selling financial products. Investment apps may charge brokerage fees, utilize payment for order flow (PFOF), or collect a percentage of assets under management (AUM). Payment apps may earn interest on cash amounts and charge for features like earlier withdrawals or credit card use. EY. \u201cGlobal FinTech Adoption Index 2019.\u201d Page 6.

            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Investopedia / Ellen Lindner Material requirements planning (MRP) is a software-based integrated inventory and supply management system designed for businesses. Companies use MRP to estimate quantities of raw materials, maintain inventory levels, and schedule production and deliveries. MRP helps businesses and manufacturers define what is needed, how much is needed, and when materials are needed and works backward from a production plan for finished goods. MRP converts a plan into a list of requirements for the subassemblies, parts, and raw materials needed to produce a final product within the established schedule. MRP helps manufacturers get a grasp of inventory requirements while balancing both supply and demand. Using MRP, managers can determine their need for labor and supplies and improve their production efficiency by inputting data into the MRP scheme such as: Manufacturers manage the\u00a0types and quantities of materials they purchase strategically and cost-effectively to ensure that they can meet current and future customer demand. MRP helps companies\u00a0maintain appropriate levels of inventory so that manufacturers can better align their production with rising and falling demand. A\u00a0bill of materials (BOM) is an extensive list of raw materials, components, and assemblies required to construct, manufacture or repair a product or service. The MRP process: \u2022 Estimates demand and required materials. After determining customer demand and utilizing the bill of materials, MRP breaks down demand into specific raw materials and components. \u2022 Allocates Inventory of materials. MRP allocates inventory into the exact areas as needed. \u2022 Schedules Production. Time and labor requirements are calculated to complete manufacturing and a timeline is created. \u2022 Monitors the process. MRP automatically alerts managers of any delays and even suggests contingency plans to meet build deadlines. Material requirements planning\u00a0was the earliest of the integrated information technology (IT) systems that aimed to improve productivity for businesses by using computers and software technology. The first MRP systems of inventory management evolved in the 1940s and 1950s, using mainframe computers to extrapolate information from a bill of materials for a specific finished product into a production and purchasing plan. MRP systems expanded to include information feedback loops so that production managers could change and update the system inputs as needed. The next generation of MRP, manufacturing resources planning (MRP II), also incorporated marketing, finance, accounting, engineering, and human resources aspects into the planning process. A concept that expands on MRP is enterprise resources planning (ERP), developed in the 1990s, which uses computer technology to link various functional areas across an entire business enterprise. Materials and components are available when needed Minimized inventory levels and associated costs Reduced customer lead times  Increased manufacturing efficiency Increased labor productivity  Heavy reliance on input data accuracy  Expensive to implement Lack of flexibility in the production schedule  Tendency to hold more inventory than needed  Less capable than an overall ERP system Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is an extension of MRP systems. While MRP is a planning and control system for the resources in a company, ERP is a solution for the enterprise as a whole and an ERP system includes advanced functionality in the areas of financial, customer relationships, and sales order management. MRP can be a stand-alone application or a piece of an ERP, a single solution that addresses all business needs, not just the scheduling of resources. It decreases any information redundancies and adds elements, like user-level security. Benefits of an ERP system include increased efficiency, integrated information, customized reports, and higher-quality customer service, The three basic inputs of an MRP system include the Master Production Schedule (MPS), Inventory Status File (ISF), and Bill of Materials (BOM). MRP ensures that materials and components are available when they're needed, inventory levels are optimized, manufacturing efficiency is improved, and customer satisfaction increases. Using required inputs, the MRP calculates what materials are needed, how much is needed to complete a build, and exactly when materials are needed in the build process. This allows businesses to use just-in-time (JIT) production, scheduling production based on material availability. This minimizes inventory levels and businesses can move materials through the manufacturing process efficiently.  Material requirements planning (MRP) is a software-based integrated inventory and supply management system that companies use to estimate quantities of raw materials and schedule production. By inputting information like the Master Production Schedule, Inventory Status File, and the Bill of Materials (BOM), MRP calculates the materials needed, how much are needed, and when they are needed in the manufacturing process."

            "title": "What Is a Virtual Assistant, and What Does One Do?",
            "content": "Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Investopedia / Sydney Saporito A virtual assistant is an independent contractor who provides administrative services to clients while operating outside of the client's office. A virtual assistant typically operates from a home office but can access the necessary planning documents, such as shared calendars, remotely. People employed as virtual assistants often have several years of experience as an administrative assistant or office manager. New opportunities are opening up for virtual assistants who are skilled in social media, content management, blog post writing, graphic design, and internet marketing. As working from home has become more accepted for both workers and employers, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for skilled virtual assistants is expected to grow. Virtual assistants have become more prominent as small businesses and startups rely on virtual offices to keep costs down and businesses of all sizes increase their use of the internet for daily operations. Because a virtual assistant is an independent contractor, a business does not have to provide the same benefits or pay the same taxes that it would for a full-time employee. A virtual assistant is different from a salaried administrative assistant who works from home and would have the same compensation and same tax structure as any other full-time employee. Also, since the virtual assistant works offsite, there is no need for a desk or other workspace at the company's office. A virtual assistant is expected to pay for and provide their own computer equipment, commonly used software programs, and high-speed Internet service. In a study of over 50 career categories, FlexJobs found virtual administration was one of the top 10 fastest-growing remote career categories. The specific duties of a virtual assistant vary according to the needs of the client and the terms of the contract. Some virtual assistants handle clerical and bookkeeping tasks, while others may post regular updates to social media or write articles for a blog. A well-rounded virtual assistant may also handle travel arrangements, appointment scheduling, data entry, and online file storage. While there are no hard-and-fast educational requirements to become a virtual assistant, many clients will look for virtual assistants who have some higher-level education or specialized training. A few online companies and community colleges offer courses and certification for virtual assistant skills. A virtual assistant should be tech-savvy, having a wide range of computer skills and a high level of proficiency with commonly used software and business programs. A virtual assistant who specializes in bookkeeping should be adept at basic accounting tasks, such as account reconciliations and double-entry bookkeeping. For the client, one advantage of hiring a virtual assistant is the flexibility to contract for just the services they need. Depending on the terms of the agreement, some virtual assistants may be paid by the task rather than by the hour. In contrast, employees in a traditional office setting usually must be paid for a fixed number of hours per day. For small business owners, hiring a virtual assistant can help them free up valuable hours to focus on growing the business and generating revenue. It can be easier and more cost-effective to outsource tasks that are tedious and time-consuming, to someone who is skilled at them. With the increasing number of freelance contractors who work from home, the employment market has seen a proliferation of Web-based companies that serve as intermediaries between prospective employers and contractors. Some freelancer sites have enormous work pools made up of individuals across the globe with a wide range of experience and expertise. On these sites, clients can post details about the type of tasks they need the virtual assistant to perform and the maximum rate they are willing to pay. Freelance workers may then bid on the job and give the client samples of their work for review. In some cases, the client can set up a video conference to interview the applicants and to more thoroughly assess their qualifications. Before hiring a virtual assistant, the client can ensure a smoother working relationship by creating detailed instructions about tasks they need to have performed. A written manual reduces the risk of misunderstandings that can occur in a remote working relationship. Having previous experience as an administrative assistant or support staff member is helpful, but not necessary. Even individuals without past experience can take training courses to learn needed skills, such as the Microsoft Office Suite or other administrative software. Freelance networks such as Upwork and Fiverr provide marketplaces where contractors can seek out positions. Contractors can also seek out work on more traditional job boards or through networking sites such as LinkedIn. A virtual assistant has some of the same challenges as an in-person assistant, including working with a variety of programs, managing and prioritizing competing tasks and answering to an employer. What's different is that the virtual assistant is doing all of this remotely, without frequent in-person interaction, in a different location than their employer. This may be a less stressful environment for many employees. However, it's also an environment without any technical support staff on hand if there are any technological problems. The compensation varies depending on what the assignment is and who you're working for. According to job search site Indeed, the national average for virtual assistants is just over $25 per hour, particularly for more basic administrative assistant jobs. Jobs with a higher value skill set, such as design, can command a higher price. Some of these jobs are advertised on standard job sites, such as Robert Half, Monster, and Indeed and have established hourly rates. For contractors who advertise their services on sites such as Upwork or Fiverr set their own rates and therefore can charge more. Facebook and other social media platforms also advertise for virtual assistants. A virtual assistant is a remote administrative assistant who works for a company or individual on a self-employed, or contract basis. A virtual assistant helps with office management work but can also tackle a variety of writing, editing, design, marketing and social media-related activities. A virtual assistant works remotely, using technology to complete assignments, despite not being in a physical office alongside their co-workers or employers. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many employees worked virtually, not only as assistants, but in a variety of capacities.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn what it takes to automate your investing Automated investing might be the smartest way to simplify wealth-building. By automating your investing you\u2019re less likely to miss funds as they are withdrawn from your paycheck and\u00a0 transferred directly into your 401(k) or an investment account. From beginners to sophisticated options traders, automated investing is a crucial strategy to compound investment growth. We\u2019ve designed this guide to help you explore the ways to automate your investing from simply reinvesting dividends to regular transfers into a robo-advisor. It\u2019s usually quick and easy to automate your investing. Before setting up the account, review the platform\u2019s FAQ pages for the range of account minimums and potential approvals needed to open an automated investing account. Each platform will have its own process. Next, gather your bank account and personal information, such as your Social Security number. The investment account platform will walk you through the process step-by-step. Here\u2019s what you can expect when setting up your automated investing account: You can set up an automated investment plan in a variety of ways. From robo-advisors to your employer 401(k), we\u2019ll give you the rundown. Choose one or more automated investment types to ensure that you are converting today\u2019s earnings into wealth for tomorrow. First, find out what information is required to open an automated investing account. The personal information and documentation required to complete the onboarding process typically includes: Fortunately for investors, there are many automated investment accounts with low-minimum deposit requirements. Minimum deposits can range from zero for many well-known investment brokerage firms up to $100,000 for the comprehensive Empower robo-advisor, which also includes access to certified financial planners. If you are new to investing and just starting out, you might open your automated investing account at a major brokerage firm that doesn\u2019t require a minimum investment, such as Fidelity Go. Or, if you\u2019re seeking a robo-advisor with low minimums, SoFi Automated Investing, M1 Finance, Betterment, Ally, and Ellevest all require $100 or less to get started. With so many choices about how to automate investing, it can be confusing to narrow down your selection. To make the decision easier, evaluate these factors: Customer service: Phone customer service can be very important for both new and experienced investors. Be aware that some platforms do not offer live customer service. If talking to a human matters to you, then look into live customer service availability and contact times. Fees and commissions: Research from Vanguard and other firms has shown a direct correlation between lower fees and higher investment performance. Before investing with any platform, understand the fees you\u2019ll be paying, including management fees and fund expense ratios. Determine whether the services you\u2019re receiving are worth the fees. Account minimum: Investigate how much money you\u2019ll need to open the account as well as maintain it. Determine whether there is a minimum balance requirement and if it is suitable for your financial situation. Research tools: For self-directed investment accounts, carefully review the screeners, calculators, trading platforms, and research report availability. If you\u2019re a self-directed investor, make certain, before opening an account, that the research tools match up with your needs. Automated investing is a strategy to ensure that you regularly save and invest for the future. We all have the tendency to forget to implement our best intentions. New Year's resolutions are frequently forgotten by February. Automated investing pre-programs our behavior to put investing for the future first. Automated investing is best for anyone interested in converting today's earnings into tomorrow's prosperity. This strategy works when saving for retirement, a child's college education, general wealth-building, and saving for any goal that is more than five years in the future. The automated investment concept involves implementing a few simple steps. First, select a paycheck, personal checking, or savings account from which the investment funds will be drawn. Next, choose where you want to invest. The choices include your workplace retirement account, a self-directed investment account, a micro-investing app, or a robo-advisor. Reinvesting your dividends and capital gains within your brokerage account is also considered automated investing. Pick the specific investments, and then set up a regular transfer from the cash account into the investment account. Finally, you choose the amount and frequency of your auto investment strategy. Once the plan is enacted, your money will automatically transfer into the designated accounts and investments. That way, when markets go down, you\u2019ll be less tempted to stop investing, because the entire process is automated. In fact, when markets go down, you\u2019ll be set up to benefit from one of the best investment tenets: \u201cBuy low.\u201d Think of automated investing like automated bill pay. You set up the parameters, such as amount to be invested, the investment vehicles, and the funding method. After setup, regular transfers from your bank account or paycheck go directly to your investment accounts.\u00a0This automates the contributions to your investment account. If you have a self-directed account, you may have another step to them put that money to work. Often this can be eliminated if you are buying into pre-built portfolios offered by your brokerage. You can also automate the investment portfolio through a robo-advisor where the contributions will automatically be invested according to the allocations and rules that were created as part of your account setup. Automated investing is a good idea for nearly everyone. Behavioral finance research suggests that we are not always rational decision-makers. By helping you overcome less optimal investment behavior, such as irregular investing or avoiding investment, automated investing can improve your long-term financial success. Automated investing removes money from your account before you can spend it and diverts it into long-term financial assets, leading to wealth-building, Investing in financial markets is risky in that the value of your initial investment can decline. In fact, automated investing might be considered less risky than do-it-yourself investing. By regularly deploying money into the financial markets during both up and down markets, you are practicing dollar-cost-averaging. This ensures that you will buy more shares when prices are lower and fewer shares when prices are higher. This is the \u201cbuy low\u201d recommendation in action. Micro-investing apps have their pros and cons. The benefit of these round-up investment apps is that you can get started and continue investing regularly. The disadvantage is that if you only invest your spare change and do not set up a larger automated deposit into the app, it will take you a long time to build a substantial account balance. For example, assume that monthly, you invest $50 in spare change into your investment account, which earns an average 7% per year. After 10 years, that account will be worth $8,704. Now add in a $350 monthly auto deposit in addition to the $50 spare change investment and you\u2019re investing $400 per month. With an average 7% annual return, your account will grow to roughly $69,637 in 10 years. Yes, there are multiple reasons to use an automated investing platform. Anyone serious about planning for their future would be wise to consider setting up automated investment strategies.

            "title": "Overview of Insurtech & Its Impact on the Insurance Industry",
            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Investopedia / Sydney Saporito Insurtech refers to the use of technology innovations designed to find cost savings and efficiency from the current insurance industry model. Insurtech is a combination of the words \u201cinsurance\u201d and \u201ctechnology,\u201d inspired by the term fintech. Insurtech is premised on the belief that the insurance industry is ripe for innovation and disruption. Insurtech is exploring avenues that large insurance firms have less incentive to exploit, such as offering ultra-customized policies, social insurance, and using new streams of data from Internet-enabled devices to dynamically price premiums according to observed behavior. Regarding traditional insurance, some people pay more than they should be based on the basic level of data used to group people. Among other things, insurtech is looking to tackle this data and analysis issue head-on. Using inputs from all manners of devices, including geolocation tracking of cars to the activity trackers on our wrists, these companies are building more finely delineated groupings of risk, allowing products to be priced more competitively. In addition to better pricing models, insurtech startups are testing the waters on a host of potential game-changers. These include using deep learning trained artificial intelligence (AI) to handle the tasks of brokers and find the right mix of policies to complete an individual\u2019s coverage. There is also interest in the use of apps to pull disparate policies into one platform for management and monitoring, creating on-demand insurance for micro-events like borrowing a friend's car, and the adoption of the peer-to-peer model to both create customized group coverage and incentivize positive choices through group rebates. There are many similarities to the goals and implementations of insurtech and fintech, as both the insurance industry and financial industry are undergoing substantial process changes. Insurtech plays an important part in changing how coverage is applied and paid for in a number of different ways: The claims management process traditionally resulted in manually reviewing each claim, deciding what compensation to award, then remitting that compensation. Now, insurtech companies aim to build processes that automate certain processes and detect fraud. Larger companies can leverage technology to gather and aggregate specific data points regarding specific claims. These claims may also be validated using automation by comparing different data streams. Last, large companies can use automation or repetitive workflows to pay out a large number of claims with minimal human intervention. The underwriting process entails reviewing an individual's profile, assessing their risk profile, and extending them an insurance package offer that includes their coverage. The information provided to a client also includes their monthly premium in addition to what compensation they may be entitled to under various claims. Much of this data can be mined or gathered automatically. Even if a client must submit information, modern technology uses many data points to compare against historical data that can continually learn, grow, and make more educated assumptions. This means the data decides for itself whether to extend a policy to the individual and what price is fair for the associated level of risk. Whether it's related to paying out a claim, enforcing a different insurance level tier, closing a customer's policy that has expired, or approving a new customer, there are a tremendous number of contracts that occur related to insurance. When leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts can be triggered to execute when specific criteria is met. This eliminates the human element for needing to handle the contract, and this allows an unbiased, neutral party (i.e. technology) to evaluate the criteria of a contract and decide the appropriate course of action. As mentioned earlier, big data can be used to gather, analyze, and summarize information. This includes analyzing a customer's historical activity or assessing a broad range of claim types. Based on the information gathered, insurers may be able to detect fraud, protect against unsuitable risk, or better understand where they may be most exposed. According to Grand View Research, the total insurtech industry value in 2022 was $5.4 billion. The revenue forecast for 2030 is $152 billion. There continues to be a growing, evolving range of technology used in insurtech that changes the way insurance is being performed. Here are the following most notable technologies being leveraged. Artificial intelligence functions allow certain tasks that previously required human interaction to now be performed exclusively reliant on technology. For example, customers would previously have to interact with representatives to have questions answered; now, interactive discussions with chatbots may allow a customer to receive help without talking to a human. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, the ability to extract historical data and compile predictive models. These models are then used to distribute information and may be set to a feedback loop. If future data in fed into the model, the model may \"learn\" and continually evaluate how to calculate appropriate premiums based on demographics or risk profiles. Insurtech change relies on efficiency. This means that when insurance clients fill out a document online, that record is automatically stored in a data warehouse or used to automatically compile a policy ready for signature. Automation tools are utilized to avoid manual human intervention when technological tools can carry out a process on its own. Big data refers to the collection of massive amounts of information. This includes a broad range of data, the fast collection of real-time data, and a variety of data sets. Big data collection techniques allow insurers to gather a broader set of data used to analyze the risk profile of a customer to better understand their characteristics and habits. In addition, this information can be gathered for millions of customers and fed into predictive models discussed earlier. Though most known for cryptocurrency, the fundamental basis for blockchain technology is immutable, distributed legers. This allows for unalterable record-keeping to ensure security and reliability in information storage. It also allows for smart contract execution to reside on a blockchain, remaining dormant until specific conditions are met to release insurance proceeds or validate an insurance client. Insurtech also relies on innovative hardware technologies as well. Drones can be used to assess properties, evaluate property damage where it might have been physically unsafe for humans to traverse, or audit a site for a claim. Drones are now becoming increasingly reliant on high-definition photo and video quality, allowing for assessors to heavily rely on photographs and stored images from flights. Another insurtech innovation that relies on physical innovation is the Internet of Things (IoT). Though a digital concept, IoT relies on the interaction between physical goods and software. For example, auto insurers now commonly offer devices that gauge vehicle speed, handling, and driving habits that can be used to reward positive driving habits or penalize negative driving habits. While this level of information has never been available before, insurance companies can now base premiums on the smallest of details. According to Hourly, there are over 3,400 insurtech companies, up from 1,500 companies in 2018. Below are examples of real insurtech companies and the ways each are innovating the insurance industry. Lemonade directly sells insurance coverage via a custom mobile app. This coverage is sold directly to the customer as opposed to being transmitted via brokers. Insurance policies include renters' insurance, homeowners' insurance, pet insurance, and auto insurance. All insurance claims processing is performed through the digital platform. Dacadoo leverages consumer devices such as phones and smartwatches to gather information via an integrated API. This information crafts individual consumer profiles that allows Dacadoo to assess risk in real-time and adjust profiles based on positive or negative life improvements. Bdeo leverages artificial intelligence to improve the claim processing experience. Bdeo relies on chatbots to interact with customers to gather claim information. The chatbot gives direction on what information is needed, how to photograph the damage, and where to input information. Then, remote adjusters analyze the information provided. The company also leverages a computer vision model that utilizes technology to minimize adjustor misevaluations. Etherisc leverages blockchain technology to utilize smart contracts. Etherisc gathers information from third-party providers. Then, as events unfold, the company is able to have their contracts automatically perform tasks based on outcomes that are compared against this third-party information. For example, agribusiness insurance claims may automatically process when specific natural conditions occur; these natural conditions such as rainfall are compared with third-party data to ensure no fraudulent activity may occur. Avinew is a pioneer in the insurtech industry regarding internet of thing technology. The company offers lower premiums to customers who change their driving habits, choose less risky routes, or use an automatic driving system. This information is all possible by onboard devices that track vehicle useage and tendencies. Although many of these innovations are long overdue, there are reasons why the incumbent insurance companies are so reluctant to adapt. Insurance is a highly regulated industry with many layers of jurisdictional legal baggage to deal with. As such, the major companies have survived this long by being incredibly cautious, which has made them shy away from working with any startups\u2014let alone startups in their own, very stable industry. This is a bigger problem than it sounds, as many of the insurtech startups still require the help of traditional insurers to handle underwriting and manage catastrophic risk. That said, as more insurtech startups garner consumer interest with a refined model and a user-friendly approach, they may find that the incumbent players warm to the idea of insurtech and become interested in buying up some of the innovation. There is also a certain level of privacy that is relinquished when adopting insurtech methodologies. Consider tracking devices that can detect whether you actually stop at stop signs. These devices also track your location, the places you visit, and how long you are at those locations. For some, this level of data collection and personally identifiable information is less preferable than the benefit received from the efficient, innovation of insurtech. Insurtech is a combination of \"insurance\" and \"technology\". It is an emerging industry that utilizes technology and modern innovations to change how traditional insurance is performed. Insurtech and fintech are often considered two different industries. Both rely on modern solutions to change how traditional services are performed. However, there are many differences between the financial sector and insurance sector. Therefore, insurtech companies are not likely to offer financial services in addition to insurance coverage. Insurtech relies on minimal overhead and operational efficient to make money. Though it still earns revenue from clients, the goal is to have minimal costs by eliminating a physical office or personnel to perform tasks that have been eliminated through chatbots or automation. Due to lower costs, insurtech companies are often able to offer lower prices. Some customers may prefer face-to-face interactions with a dedicated insurance agent they've gotten to know for years. Other customers may prefer to self-select their own policy that can be canceled using an app. Insurtech simply offers a different method of delivering insurance coverage that traditional insurance may not have been able to offer. Whether one is better than the other is simply a matter of consumer preference. The traditional insurance industry is being disrupted by the introduction of technology. This new sector called insurtech offers customers a new way to do things by gathering information differently, executing contracts more efficiently, and analyzing information more accurately. Though some may feel the insurance industry will be losing a personal touch, insurtech strives to offer lower, more custom, and more flexible coverage.

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Investopedia / Mira Norian Cost per click (CPC) is an online advertising revenue model that websites use to bill advertisers based on the number of times visitors click on a display ad attached to their sites. The primary alternative is the cost per mille (CPM) model, which charges 1,000 ad impressions\u2014or views\u2014of the display ad, regardless of whether or not a viewer clicks on the ad. The cost-per-click model is also known as pay-per-click (PPC), Advertisers commonly use cost per click with a set daily budget for a campaign. When the advertiser's budget is reached, the ad is automatically removed from the website's rotation for the remainder of the billing period. For example, a website with a cost-per-click rate of $.10 would bill an advertiser $100 for 1,000 click-throughs. Most publishers use a third party to match them with advertisers. The largest such entity is Google Ads, which uses a platform called Google AdSense. A click costs no more than you're willing to pay through a bidding system. For example, you could bid a maximum of $1 per click on Google Ads. The system runs through algorithms that evaluate your ads and charges you no more than your bid. However, there are some caveats. The Google Ads system applies discounts to advertisers with higher ad Quality Scores. This score is determined by the relevance of the ad and the advertiser's content to the search terms used. You'll also be dinged in the position of your ad the lower you bid, again adjusting for the other factors evaluated by the platform. A formula may be used to determine the rate you pay per click. One of the most popular ways to calculate your CPC is: Some publishers or platforms like Google Ads use a bidding process to set their rates. For instance, Google Ads asks you to select the maximum amount you're willing to pay per click. Google's platform then uses Ad Rank thresholds to determine the actual cost when your ad is clicked. This means your cost varies up to your maximum because the platform ranks your bid, ad quality, position, user signals, search topics, and related auctions and sets the cost per click. You can even have Google automate the bids for you to increase your click-through. The platform then positions your ad based on your maximum amount, with higher maximums achieving a higher placement on the page. Because advertising can become very expensive when paying by clicks, you need to have a plan to keep from paying too much per click. This means researching and creating a strategy with keywords to raise your Quality Score, a large measure of how your ads compete with others. Your Quality Score is crucial to increasing your clicks and decreasing your costs. You can improve your Quality Score by making adjustments to your: Keywords drive internet searches, so it makes sense to ensure you have keywords in your ads that lead people to your website. Some techniques you can try are: There are plenty of alternatives to Google AdSense, including Media.net, Infolinks, Amazon Advertising, and Bidvertiser, to name a few. Some specialize in small or large publishers, and some offer a better deal than Google AdSense to stay competitive. Amazon Advertising is designed to allow Amazon website affiliates to place ads that reach shoppers on and off the website when searching for specific products. Meta Ads Manager allows advertisers to run campaigns on Facebook and Instagram. In the print world, advertisers choose publications that match their customer profiles and place ads in them. They pay more for bigger ads and more prominent placement, but the effectiveness of those ads can usually only be implied by tracking before-and-after sales numbers. Coupons and contests are among the strategies that help them track their ads' effectiveness better. In the online world, advertisers know how many people are at least interested enough to click on their ads. That has led to two of the primary ways to reach consumers through web advertising: Higher value Drives website traffic More expensive than CPM Prices vary widely Less effective for brand and product awareness Cost per click is how much it costs you when a propective customer clicks on your ad. Cost per click is generally calculated by dividing the overall cost of your ads by the number of clicks your ads received. Cost per click is a measurement of the amount of money you pay when a consumer clicks your ads, and cost per mille is the cost you pay per 1,000 ad impressions\u2014or 1,000 loads of a page with your ad on it. Cost per click is significant because it shows you how much you're paying for your advertising and how effective your campaign is. Demographic targeting of advertising was created offline, primarily by the print magazine industry. It allowed advertisers to choose a specialty magazine that reached the audience that was most likely to be interested in their product. The cost-per-click advertising model emerged with the internet. It added an actionable element in the ability to immediately click on a link to get more information, place an order, claim a coupon, or download an app. The software for creating ads and buying ad space is growing increasingly sophisticated. However, the primary concern of advertisers in using either the cost-per-click or cost-per-impression models is accuracy in reporting the actual numbers that the ad reaches.

            "title": "Open Banking: Definition, How It Works, and Risks",
            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Investopedia / Sydney Burns Open banking is also known as \"open bank data.\" Open banking is a banking practice that provides third-party financial service providers open access to consumer banking, transaction, and other financial data from banks and non-bank financial institutions through the use of application programming interfaces (APIs). Open banking will allow the networking of accounts and data across institutions for use by consumers, financial institutions, and third-party service providers. Open banking is becoming a major source of innovation that is poised to reshape the banking industry. Under open banking, banks allow access and control of customers personal and financial data to third-party service providers, which are typically tech startups and online financial service vendors. Customers are normally required to grant some kind of consent to let the bank allow such access, such as checking a box on a terms-of-service screen in an online app. Third-party providers APIs can then use the customer's shared data (and data about the customer's financial counterparties). Uses might include comparing the customer's accounts and transaction history to a range of financial service options, aggregating data across participating financial institutions and customers to create marketing profiles, or making new transactions and account changes on the customer's behalf. Open banking is a driving force of innovation in the banking industry. By relying on networks instead of centralization, open banking can help financial services customers to securely share their financial data with other financial institutions. For example, open banking APIs can facilitate the sometimes onerous process of switching from using one bank's checking account service to another bank's. The API can also look at consumers' transaction data to identify the best financial products and services for them, such as a new savings account that would earn a higher interest rate than the current savings account or a different credit card with a lower interest rate. Through the use of networked accounts, open banking could help lenders get a more accurate picture of a consumer's financial situation and risk level in order to offer more profitable loan terms. It could also help consumers get a more accurate picture of their own finances before taking on debt. An open banking app for customers who want to buy a home could automatically calculate what customers can afford based on all the information in their accounts, perhaps providing a more reliable picture than mortgage lending guidelines currently provide. Another app might help visually impaired customers better understand their finances through voice commands. Open banking can also help small businesses save time through online accounting and help fraud detection companies better monitor customer accounts and identify problems sooner. Open banking will force large, established banks to be more competitive with smaller and newer banks, ideally resulting in lower costs, better technology, and better customer service. Established banks will have to do things in new ways that they are not currently set up to handle and spend money to adopt new technology. However, banks can take advantage of this new technology to strengthen customer relationships and customer retention by better helping customers to manage their finances instead of simply facilitating transactions. Before banks offered open banking, the closest thing available were aggregation sites like Mint or Personal Capital that combine users' account information from all their financial institutions so they can see it in one place. Such services accomplish this by requiring users to hand over their usernames and passwords for each account, then scraping the data off the screens of those accounts. This practice has security risks and the results of screen scraping are not always entirely accurate, making it difficult at times for users to identify transactions. In addition, users may find that not all of their financial accounts are compatible with account aggregation services, preventing them from getting a true or complete picture of their finances. APIs are considered a more secure option because they enable applications to share data directly without sharing account credentials. Open banking may offer benefits in the form of convenient access to financial data and services to consumers and streamlining some costs for financial institutions. However it also potentially poses severe risks to financial privacy and the security of consumers' finances, as well as resulting liabilities to financial institutions. Open banking APIs are not without security risks, such as the potential for a malicious third-party app to clean out a customer's account. This would be an extreme (and less likely) threat. Much broader concerns would simply be data breaches due to poor security, hacking, or insider threats that have become relatively widespread in the modern era, including at financial institutions, and will likely remain commonplace as more data becomes interconnected in more ways. Open banking is likely to alter the competitive landscape of the financial services industry, which could benefit consumers by increasing competition as described above, but could also have the reverse effect and increase consumer costs if it leads to consolidation in financial services, due to the natural economies of scale from big data and network effects. Resulting market concentration and associate pricing power could more than offset any cost advantages to consumers. Such market consolidation has already been seen and widely criticized in other internet-based services, such as online shopping, search engines, and social media, in that it is widely believed by consumers and regulators to result in misuse of customers' data by tech giants for their own benefit. Beyond the direct costs of market concentration, similar misuse of customers private financial data could ultimately raise even greater concerns.

The changes made to the Global Industry Classification System\u00a0(GICS)\u00a0are prompting investors the world over to re-evaluate how they invest. In the process of the GICS changes, stocks from sectors like consumer discretionary, tech\u00a0and telecommunications are joining together into a new Communication Services sector. For the everyday investor, determining how to allocate assets just became\u00a0even more complicated as a new set of issues joins the existing list of research points to consider before investing in a company: operations, clientele, products, revenues and earnings, and so on. The GICS\u00a0is a standardized classification system for equities developed jointly by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) and Standard & Poor's. The GICS methodology is used by the MSCI indexes, which include domestic and international stocks, as well as by a large portion of the professional investment management community. Reclassification or not, GICS provides both useful categorization and, for some investors, a limiting approach. Each company is designated to a single classification, although many real-life operations might be split among multiple sectors and areas. There have already been efforts by some investors and firms to reclassify companies according to a more complex (some would say more true-to-life) set of frameworks in order to allow for better risk management and trading cohort classification. More recently, exchange-traded funds\u00a0(ETFs)\u00a0began adopting the same approach, all with the help of computer-assisted management. BlackRock, Inc.'s (BLK) suite of ETFs, the iShares Evolved Sector ETFs, uses this model. These funds utilize natural language-processing technology in order to analyze company business models and public filings. Then, the program makes a calculation of a given company's business distribution and assigns the company to relevant sectors, including multiple classifications if the program deems it appropriate to do so. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), one of the most diverse and rapidly evolving companies today, is a good illustration of how BlackRock's new computer-sorted sector system works. Amazon still makes the bulk of its sales through its e-commerce platform, but it also has ventures in many other areas, including cloud computing. Nonetheless, GICS classifies Amazon as Consumer Discretionary. In the iShares Evolved U.S. Technology ETF (IETC) and the iShares Evolved U.S. Discretionary Spending ETF (IEDI), the two of BlackRock's new suite of funds in which Amazon\u00a0appears, it is present as a technology company and as a consumer discretionary one, respectively. GICS looks at past sales and earnings, meaning that it is reflexive. It's also possible to use algorithms to make predictions about sector classifications. By analyzing regulatory filings for signs of future trends, the Evolving Sector ETFs aim to capitalize on emerging areas of influence. For the ETF investor, nothing much has changed when a fund is relying on computers to parse out business models and earnings reports. Indeed, the change may be significantly greater on the management side, as computers receive greater shares of responsibility when it comes to analyzing materials and preparing data, or even making decisions about sector classification and rebalancing holdings. While there are advantages to BlackRock's system, some investors may wish to rely on the traditional GICS classifications. Beyond that, investors interested in transparency may be surprised to find a consumer discretionary stock showing up in a fund that claims to be focused on tech companies. Regardless, computer-driven ETFs are neither brand new nor likely to disappear any time soon.

            "content": "A mobile payment is a money payment made for a product or service through a portable electronic device such as a tablet or cell phone. Mobile payment technology can also be used to send money to friends or family members, such as with the applications PayPal and Venmo. Many banks have recently adopted technology into their banking apps that allow customers to send money instantly to friends and family members directly from their bank accounts. Mobile payments are also made on site at stores by scanning a barcode on an app on your phone, accepting payments from convenience stores to large, multi-national retailers. The cost of the purchase may be deducted from a pre-loaded value on the account associated with the particular store, or paid by credit or debit card. Payment information is encrypted during transmission, so it is thought of as being a safer payment method than paying with a debit or credit card. Mobile payments work much the same as credit cards, without needing to reach for your wallet or purse. Mobile payments first became popular in Asia and Europe before becoming more common in the United States and Canada. Early on, mobile payments were sent by text message. Later, technology allowed for pictures of checks to be taken via cell phone camera and sent to the payment recipient. This technology eventually morphed into mobile check deposit capabilities for banking apps. Since 2014, apps such as PayPal and Apple Pay were developed that allow payment by passing a smartphone screen displaying a special barcode under a store's barcode scanner. They also allow the user to simply tap their phone against a contactless credit card terminal, paying instantaneously. Soon to develop applications were competitors to Apple, companies like Google and Samsung, who released their respective mobile payment apps in the wake of Apple pay's success. The most obvious benefit of mobile payments is the elimination of a physical wallet. Not reaching and pulling out cash not only saves time but is safer as well as nobody is able to see the contents of your wallet or purse. Touch ID in the form of a fingerprint scan or PIN input makes mobile payments more secure than a physical credit card. Since individual security codes are generated by the mobile service for each transaction, this method of payment is significantly safer than using a physical card. Merchants will usually not check identification, so accepting mobile payments is a smart move for them as well, as they will not have to deal with fraudulent activity as much. An additional benefit\u2014though a minor one for most people\u2014is that when you are with other people they are not able to tell what card you have. Users with low credit scores and credit cards with low limits and high APRs might not want, say, an interviewer or date to know these things, and mobile payments offer an additional level of personal privacy.

            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. EDGAR\u2014Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval\u2014is the electronic filing system created by the Securities and Exchange Commission to increase the\u00a0efficiency and accessibility of\u00a0corporate filings. The\u00a0system is used by all publicly traded companies when submitting required documents to the SEC. Corporate documents are time-sensitive, and the creation of EDGAR has greatly decreased the time it takes for corporate documents to become publicly available.  Under the Securities Act of 1933, public companies are required to publish their financial data every three months. Although this information was theoretically available to all investors, it was difficult to access in the age of paper communication. The SEC began developing an electronic reporting system in the early 1980s, launching the first pilot in 1984. The first operational EDGAR system was launched in 1992, but electronic reporting was still voluntary at that time. Beginning in 1993, the commission began to phase in the requirement for electronic filing. Corporate documents filed with the SEC through EDGAR include annual and quarterly statements, information on\u00a0the holdings of institutional investors, and many other forms. These filings include some of the most important information used by investors and analysts. Some public companies may be exempt from filing if they fall below certain \"thresholds.\" The Securities Act of 1933 requires all public companies to disclose certain financial data. EDGAR makes this information more accessible to retail investors. EDGAR consists of a searchable database with more than twenty years of electronic filings. Users can search the database in the same manner as an online search, using either the name of a company or individual. Search results can be further narrowed down by date, location of the company's executive offices, or the type of file sought. In addition to company data, EDGAR can also be used to research mutual funds, variable insurance products, or confidential treatment orders. These are orders that restrict access to data that is otherwise required to be filed. A drawback of the EDGAR\u00a0system is that the filings are highly stripped down and often difficult to read compared to annual reports received by shareholders. All the information is contained in the filings, but details can be difficult to find in\u00a0one huge\u00a0text file. However, the information is always structured in the same way regardless of which company filed the information. For example, if an analyst is interested in knowing if a company made any changes to its accounting methods, the investor will find that information in Part II, Item 9, in the annual report (or 10-K). Due to increased access to the Internet, most of the reports on EDGAR can be found on the websites of the company that reported them. This can be an easier user experience than the EDGAR database, where users might have to sift through many reports by similarly-named companies in order to find the document they want. Provides a single repository for public filings. Allows easy access to 20+ years of corporate financial data, as well as mutual funds and variable investment products. Search function can be clumsy, and cluttered with similar-sounding companies. It may be easier to find reports on the webpage of the reporting company. Documents that are accessed using EDGAR and filed with the SEC include quarterly and annual corporate reports and financial statements.\u00a0Annual Reports (Form 10-K) include company\u00a0history, audited financial statements, a description of products and services, and an annual review of the organization, its operations, and the company\u2019s markets.\u00a0Quarterly Reports (Form 10-Q) include unaudited financial statements and information about the company\u2019s operations in the previous three months. Documents filed before 1995 may not be available on EDGAR but can be requested through the Freedom of Information Act. Other reports that are often searched by investors are\u00a0Registration Statements, which are required before stock can be sold to the public;\u00a0Form 8-K, which discloses notable events such as bankruptcy;\u00a0Forms 3 and 4, which contain ownership information;\u00a0and\u00a0Form 5, which reports transactions not reported on Form 4. EDGAR documents are available as far back as 1995 or 1994. Paper filings from earlier dates may be available through the Freedom of Information Act. In 2016, a Ukrainian hacker used stolen login credentials to access filings on the EDGAR system that had not yet been released. This information was then passed on to traders, who were able to trade on the advance knowledge of company reporting figures before they were published. Edgar Filer Management is a portal for companies and individuals who wish to submit electronic filings to the SEC. This is more complicated than searching the EDGAR database, and it requires Filers to submit a Form ID for authorization in order to create an access code. One can find a proxy filing, or any other public filing, by searching the EDGAR database by company name. The search results may need to be refined with additional specifications like filing date or category. Proxy statements are filed under form 14K. The System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) is an electronic reporting tool used by Canadian public companies and securities issuers. This is the Canadian equivalent to EDGAR, maintained by the Canadian Securities Authority (CSA). EDGAR is a convenient way to access the electronic reports of any public company in the United States. However, the search function can be clumsy, and it is far from intuitive. In the age of the Internet, much of this data can be found just as easily on a company webpage.

            "content": "Adam Hayes, Ph.D., CFA, is a financial writer with 15+ years Wall Street experience as a derivatives trader. Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master's in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology. He is a CFA charterholder as well as holding FINRA Series 7, 55 & 63 licenses. He currently researches and teaches economic sociology and the social studies of finance at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. A constant ratio plan (also known as \"constant mix\" or \"constant weighting\" investing) is a strategic asset allocation strategy, or investment formula, which keeps the aggressive and conservative portions of a portfolio set at a fixed ratio. To maintain the target asset weights\u2014typically, between that of stocks and bonds\u2014the portfolio is periodically rebalanced by selling outperforming assets and buying underperforming ones. Thus, stocks are sold if they rise faster than other investments and bought if they fall in value more than the other investments in the portfolio. If a portfolio's strategic asset allocation is set to be 60% stocks and 40% bonds, a constant ratio plan will ensure that, as markets move, that 60/40 ratio is preserved over time. A constant ratio plan is an example of a long-term formula investing strategy, which does not involve security analysis and forecasting, or market timing. It is able to leverage active-like management qualities through systematic rebalancing according to a prescribed formula, as the market rises and falls. When the actual ratio differs from the desired ratio by a predetermined amount, transactions are made to rebalance the portfolio. Constant ratio plans, together with constant dollar value plans, are similar to buy-and-hold asset allocation strategies used in portfolio management, except that buy-and-hold strategies never rebalance. A constant ratio plan would ensure that a 70/30 or 80/20 asset allocation (stocks to bonds) remains 70/30 or 80/20 even as markets move. The cost of these rebalancing transactions reduces investment returns. But constant ratio plans aim to smooth out investment returns over a longer time horizon by adjusting the portfolio counter-cyclically, and taking profits on speculative stocks that have rallied strongly. By selling outperforming stocks and buying underperforming ones, constant ratio plans run counter to momentum investing strategies that sell underperforming assets and buy outperforming ones. This is why they work best in volatile markets with a general mean-reverting pattern. There are no hard-and-fast rules for timing portfolio rebalancing under strategic or constant-weighting asset allocation. However, a common rule of thumb is that the portfolio should be rebalanced to its original mix when any given asset class moves more than +/- 5% from its original target. Because capitalization-weighted indices sometimes overweight overvalued stocks and underweight undervalued ones at the peak of bull markets, some smart beta exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are also counter-cyclical\u2014targeting factors like momentum, volatility, value, and size\u2014by systematically overweighting or underweighting them. Smart-beta rebalancing uses additional criteria, such as value defined by performance measures like book value or return on capital, to allocate the holdings across a selection of stocks. This rules-based method of portfolio creation adds a layer of systematic analysis to the investment that simple index investing lacks. The constant ratio plan was one of the first strategies devised when institutions started to invest significantly in the stock market, in the 1940s. One of the first references to it exists in a July 1947 issue of the Journal of Business of the University of Chicago.  An article in the October 1949 issue of the Journal of Business of the University of Chicago discussed the need for forecasting in \"formula timing plans.\" Marshall D.

Zola was most recently valued at $650 million and,\ufeff\ufeff according to Crunchbase, has raised $140.8 million in five rounds of fundraising.\ufeff\ufeff The company\u2019s estimated annual revenue is up to $120 million.\ufeff\ufeff According to Zola, it has served 500,000 different couples since its launch. The firm is also partnered with about 600 brands \u2014 including Crate & Barrel, Soulcycle, and Sonos (SONO) \u2014 for a total of over 100,000 products.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff Like other services that take retool traditional industries with technology, Zola\u2019s key innovation is the flexibility it offers customers. Using Zola\u2019s gift registry, couples can create a list of gifts they want from their friends and family all in one place. Zola is still an underdog compared traditional registries at\u00a0brick and mortar retailers like Target (TGT) and Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY), but appeals to the millennial generation with its enormous online product catalog and easy-to-use app. Zola makes it easy to add or remove products and services to a registry with a swipe to the left or right, and provides a convenient alternative to the hours of wandering stores and scanning everything in sight. By providing one centralized online location for a couple\u2019s registry, it also cuts shopping time for wedding guests. In addition, Zola offers features that set it apart from traditional gift registries. Gift buyers can pool their money to collectively purchase the most expensive items on a couple\u2019s list. Couples can also request cash they might apply toward a honeymoon, a dream home, or whatever they choose. The ability to pool money together is a dream come true for couples. Couples can also choose when gifts are delivered, so they do not need to worry about their new dishes being left on the porch while they are on their honeymoon. Finally, Zola also has tools to help couples think outside of the box when creating their registry lists, with features that can suggest interesting products they might never have thought of otherwise. These features not only make the often complicated process of wishing for and giving wedding gifts easier, but they also offer new ways for friends and family to use their money to help newlyweds begin their new life together. Like other online stores, Zola makes money by taking a cut of the purchases made through its site. When a customer buys an experience through Zola \u2013 like a guided trip or a wine tour, the company keeps about 20% of the sale. And when a customer buys a product, Zola keeps as much as 40%, which is comparable to other retailers.\ufeff\ufeff Since the vast majority of the items Zola sells are shipped directly from the manufacturer, the company itself has practically no\u00a0inventory. This means Zola has a much smaller overhead than competing services. While other sites such as Amazon (AMZN) offer registry services with wide ranges of products, Zola differentiates itself with a large selection of activity packages, cash options, and numerous ways to personalize the experience. The percentage of revenue generated by product sales that Zola claims for itself. Whenever couples request cash, Zola charges a 2.5% fee, which couples can choose to pay themselves or pass along to their guests.\ufeff\ufeff However, according to Zola, the company does not make money from these fees. Instead, they go to covering transaction costs.\ufeff\ufeff In 2017, Zola launched a suite of free services that help funnel potential customers toward the company\u2019s online store. These services, which are known as \u201cZola Weddings\u201d include the creation of wedding websites, guest lists, RSVP tracking, and customizable checklists.\ufeff\ufeff These services obviously don\u2019t produce any revenue for Zola directly but serve to boost the company\u2019s sales revenue. Zola Weddings demonstrates that Zola understands how important it is for online businesses to build an ecosystem of products that funnel potential customers toward revenue-making business segments. The effectiveness of this one-stop-shop technique is probably best exemplified by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA), which owns a vast network of websites that all lead back to its core e-commerce sites. Although the services offered by Zola Weddings are free, they are still valuable because they funnel potential customers to Zola's online store. Investors have taken note of Zola\u2019s tech savviness. In May 2018, the company secured $100 million from six investors in its largest round of fundraising to date, more than double the amount that had been invested in Zola until then.\ufeff\ufeff Going forward, Zola plans to keep launching new products to increase the reach of its business ecosystem, further bringing the fragmented wedding industry under one roof. Zola\u2019s vision, according to Ma, is to be the \u201cgo-to wedding destination to plan every step of the wedding, from the engagement to the very first year of marriage.\u201d\ufeff\ufeff Despite the size of the wedding industry, its potential customer base is structurally limited to the number of couples getting engaged each year; about 2 million. To raise awareness about its products among this relatively small demographic, Zola has partnered with Comcast (CMCSA), which was one of the leading investors in last year\u2019s $100 million round.\ufeff\ufeff This partnership will make it easier for Zola to make appearances on popular shows on networks owned by the communications giant. Comcast, Goldman Sachs and Lightspeed Investments led Zola's latest fundraising round. Zola\u2019s biggest challenge is its competition with Amazon. The Seattle-based e-commerce giant also offers wedding registry services. And although Amazon\u2019s offerings are much less comprehensive than Zola\u2019s, Amazon is still the top wedding registry service in 24 states.\ufeff\ufeff Zola will find it difficult to compete with Amazon\u2019s unrivaled selection, as well as its wide-reaching brand recognition. This second factor is why it will be so key for Zola to advertise effectively going forward.

            "title": "Robotic Process Automation (RPA): Definition and Benefits",
            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. Robotic process automation (RPA) occurs when basic tasks are automated through software or hardware systems that function across a variety of applications, just as human workers do. This can greatly reduce labor costs and increase efficiency by speeding things up and greatly minimizing human error. The software or robot can be taught a workflow with multiple steps and applications, such as taking received forms, sending a receipt message, checking the form for completeness, filing the form in a folder, and updating a spreadsheet with the name of the form, the date filed, and so on. RPA software is designed to reduce the burden for employees of completing repetitive, simple tasks. Robotic process automation (RPA) is designed to help primarily with office-type functions that often require the ability to do several types of tasks in a specific order. It creates and deploys a software robot with the ability to launch and operate other software. In a sense, the basic concept is similar to traditional manufacturing automation, which focuses on taking one portion of a workflow\u2014or even just one task\u2014and creating a robot to specialize in doing it. Office work often requires the same sort of repetitive effort, but since it is data being manipulated across platforms and applications, a physical robot is not necessary. While automation is often sought by companies to streamline processes and cut labor costs, there have been some instances where automation has gone awry. The software used in process automation is programmed to do the tasks in a particular workflow by the employees with minimal assistance from human workers. The software doesn\u2019t learn on its own or seek to tweak out new efficiencies or new insights like big data analysis or enterprise resource management (ERM) software. Instead, RPA works like a digital assistant for employees by clearing the onerous, simple tasks that eat up part of every office worker\u2019s day. As such, RPA is a simpler product than an artificial intelligence-driven system or enterprise software that seeks to bring all data inside the platform. This also makes it a relatively cheaper product than AI or ERM software. This simplicity and relative cheapness can make RPA a more attractive solution for many companies, particularly if the company has legacy systems. Robotic process automation is designed to be compatible with most legacy applications, making it easier to implement compared to other enterprise automation solutions. Industry research suggests that the global RPA market will grow to nearly $600 billion in 2022. RPA is quite common in the financial services industry. With increasing compliance and regulatory filing requirements, the finance industry\u2014banks, insurers, and investment management companies\u2014has been an early adopter of RPA. Many onerous back-office functions, such as ensuring an up-to-date Know Your Client (KYC) form is filed or a recent credit check is included on a loan application, are ideal for RPA. Removing this burden from employees allows them to focus on high-return tasks. More importantly, the software can clear these basic filing and data manipulation functions faster than humans, reducing the overall processing time. Of course, RPA is not just limited to finance. Any industry that deals in data and filing can benefit from robotic process automation. When software can reduce costs and increase efficiency without requiring an onerous and complex implementation, it will find eager users and useful applications in almost any sector. Indeed, RPA has also been found useful in the following fields: RPA does, however, have its drawbacks. These systems can be expensive to customize and deploy, and may not be suitable for more complex tasks that require some degree of human judgment or creativity. RPA systems, when unchecked, can also go awry. One example is the case of so-called \"robo-signers\" used in the mortgage industry. These systems rubber-stamped foreclosure documents on homeowners automatically, even when a foreclosure was questionable or avoidable. Moreover, this practice failed to meet government regulations for oversight of the foreclosure process in the mid-2010s, leading to a scandal following the housing market bubble of the 2008-09 financial crisis. Following the public exposure of robo-signers, foreclosure documents had to be manually reexamined, and the companies involved faced disciplinary action. RPA is meant to automate and streamline certain redundant clerical processes for an organization using software or related technologies. This is meant to reduce costs while also increasing efficiency. RPA systems are often tailor-made to suit the specific needs of a particular organization or firm. Therefore, RPA must be coded in accordance with the specifications and application of an individual company or process. This can make development more time-consuming and expensive than other types of automation that are more turnkey. While RPA can reduce labor costs overall, those developing RPA systems remain in high demand. These include roles that range from software developers to product managers and business analysts. Traditional RPA relies on hard-coding routine tasks for automation. This is still the most common form of RPA today. More and more, however, machine learning and AI techniques are being merged with RPA to allow it to do more sophisticated tasks, such as recognizing images, text, or speech; or to analyze unstructured data sets.

            "content": "In a decentralized market, technology enables investors to deal directly with each other instead of operating from within a centralized exchange. Virtual markets that use decentralized currency, or cryptocurrencies, are examples of decentralized markets. A decentralized market uses various digital devices to communicate and display bid/ask prices in real-time. In this way, buyers, sellers, and dealers do not need to be located in the same place to transact securities. The foreign exchange (forex) market is an example of a decentralized market because there is no one physical location where investors go to buy and sell currencies. Forex traders can use the internet to check the quotes of currencies from various dealers from the world. Real estate is traditionally sold through a decentralized market, wherein buyers and sellers complete their transactions without first funneling the process through a clearinghouse. Some bonds and securitized products also may be procured via decentralized markets. The advent of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency have created more opportunities in which decentralized markets may operate. Typically, virtual markets are not regulated, which their proponents believe is a good thing. The technology and mediums\u2014such as decentralized currency\u2014of a virtual marketplace afford investors a sense of security and trust in their transactions. The growth of markets that use the decentralized currencies for financial transactions has led to discussions about ways to introduce potential regulation. Were this to occur, fans of virtual markets may see this as diminishing their perceived current benefits of anonymity and direct control of their transactions. Decentralized currency, peer-to-peer money, and digital currency all refer to bank-free methods of transferring wealth or ownership of any other commodity without needing a third party. Most centralized, and some decentralized, markets use fiat currency\u2014or physical money issued by a central bank, like U.S. dollars. Decentralized currency is used primarily in the virtual markets. Two examples of decentralized currency are bitcoin\u2014the \"coinage\" used on the Bitcoin platform\u2014and ether\u2014used on Ethereum.

            "content": "Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. In science, computing, and engineering, a black box is a device, system, or object which produces useful information without revealing any information about its internal workings. The explanations for its conclusions remain opaque or \u201cblack.\u201d Financial analysts, hedge fund managers, and investors may use software that is based on a black-box model in order to transform data into a useful investment strategy. Advances in computing power, artificial intelligence, and machine learning capabilities are causing a proliferation of black box models in many professions, and are adding to the mystique surrounding them. Black box models are eyed warily by potential users in many professions. As one physician writes in a paper about their uses in cardiology: \"Black box is shorthand for models that are sufficiently complex that they are not straightforwardly interpretable to humans.\" Many things can be described as black boxes: a transistor, an algorithm, and even the human brain. The opposite of a black box is a system made up of inner workings that are available for inspection. This is commonly referred to as a white box, although it is sometimes called a clear box or a glass box. Within financial markets, the increasing use of black box methods poses a number of concerns. A black box model is not inherently risky, but it does raise some governance and ethical questions. Investment advisors who use black box methods can conceal the true risk of the assets they recommend under the guise of protecting proprietary technology. That leaves both investors and regulators without the facts that they need to accurately assess the risk that is being undertaken. Do the benefits of black box methods offset the drawbacks? Opinions differ. The use of black box models to analyze investments has gone in and out of style over the years, usually depending on whether the financial markets are up or down. During volatile patches in the financial markets, black box strategies are singled out for their potentially destructive nature. The risk levels being undertaken may not be evident until extreme losses reveal them. Advances in computing power, big data applications, artificial intelligence, and machine learning capabilities are increasing the use and adding to the mystique surrounding black box models that use sophisticated quantitative methods. Hedge funds and some of the world\u2019s largest investment managers now routinely use black box models to manage their investment strategies. The use of the black box model in psychology can be traced to B.F. Skinner, father of the school of behaviorism. Skinner argued that psychologists should study the brain's responses, not its processes. There have been several notable instances that included extreme losses in portfolios devoted to black box strategies. Black box strategies were not to blame for these events. However, investors who were dependent on those strategies suffered from them, as did many other investors who were caught in the storm. These events include: Machine learning techniques that have greatly contributed to the growth and sophistication of black box models are closely related, particularly relevant to machine learning. In fact, it has been argued that the workings of black box predictive models that are created from algorithms can become so complex that no human could work through all of the variables involved in making a prediction. The black box model is used in engineering to build predictive models that exist in computer code rather than in physical form. The variables can then be observed, analyzed, tested, and revised without the expensive and time-consuming process of actually building them in the real world. A black box model designed for use in the financial markets is a software program that analyses market data and produces a strategy for buying and selling based upon that analysis. The user of the black box can understand the results but cannot see the logic behind them. When machine learning techniques are used in the model's construction, the inputs are in fact too complex for a human brain to interpret. The black box model of consumer behavior is drawn from the academic field of behavioral psychology. Behavioral psychologists view the human brain as a black box. The human mind responds to stimuli. In order to change behavior, the stimuli must be changed, not the mind that reacts to the stimuli. This theory has been adopted by marketers as a way to analyze the consumer decision-making process. The analysis attempts to understand and influence buying decisions by observing the consumer's response to certain stimuli. In the field of artificial intelligence, a black box model uses a machine-learning algorithm to make predictions while the explanation for that prediction remains unknowable and untraceable. A white box model attempts to incorporate restraints that make the machine learning process more transparent. Transparency, or \"interpretability,\" could be an ethical and legal objective in models used in healthcare, banking, or insurance, among other industries. Black box models are increasingly being used to create software not only for applications in the investing world but for use in healthcare, banking, engineering, and other fields. The black box model is developing in tandem with machine learning capabilities, and both are increasing in the complexity of their processes. In fact, they are becoming more opaque. That is, we are relying on their results without understanding how those results are produced.

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation through voice commands or text chats or both. Chatbot, short for chatterbot, is an artificial intelligence (AI) feature that can be embedded and used through any major messaging application. There are a number of synonyms for chatbot, including\u00a0\"talkbot,\" \"bot,\" \"IM bot,\" \"interactive agent\" or \"artificial conversation entity.\" The progressive advance of technology has seen an increase in businesses moving from traditional to digital platforms to transact with consumers. Convenience through technology is being carried out by businesses by implementing AI techniques on their digital platforms. One AI technique that is growing in its application and use is chatbots. Some examples of chatbot technology are virtual assistants like Amazon's Alexa and\u00a0Google Assistant, and messaging apps, such as WeChat\u00a0and Facebook's Messenger. A chatbot is an automated program that interacts with customers as a human would and costs little to nothing to engage with. Chatbots attend to customers at all times of the day and week and are not limited by time or a physical location. This makes its implementation appealing to a lot of businesses that may not have the manpower or financial resources to keep employees working around the clock. According to industry research, the COVID-19 pandemic greatly accelerated the implementation and user adoption of chatbots around the globe. A chatbot works in a couple of ways: set guidelines and machine learning (ML). A chatbot that functions with a set of guidelines in place is limited in its conversation. It can only respond to a set number of requests and vocabulary and is only as intelligent as its programming code. An example of a limited bot is an automated banking bot that asks the caller some questions to understand what the caller wants to do. The bot would make a command like \u201cPlease tell me what I can do for you by saying account balances, account transfer, or bill payment.\u201d If the customer responds with \"credit card balance,\" the bot would not understand the request and would proceed to either repeat the command or transfer the caller to a human assistant. Over time, chatbots have evolved with new AI advancements and are far more responsive to human interaction than chatbots based on set guidelines. A chatbot that functions through machine learning has an artificial neural network inspired by the neural nodes of the human brain. The bot is programmed to self-learn as it is introduced to new dialogues and words. In effect, as a chatbot receives new voice or textual dialogues, the number of inquiries that it can reply to and the accuracy of each response it gives increases. Meta (as Facebook's parent company is now known) has a machine learning chatbot that creates a platform for companies to interact with their consumers through the Messenger application. Using the Messenger bot, users can buy shoes from Spring, order a ride from Uber, and have conversations with The New York Times on news issues of the day. If a user asked The New York Times through the app a question like \u201cWhat\u2019s new today?\u201d or \u201cWhat do the polls say?\u201d\u00a0the bot would reply to the request. Chatbots are used in a variety of sectors and built for different purposes. There are retail bots designed to pick and order groceries, weather bots that give you weather forecasts of the day or week, and simply friendly bots that just talk to people in need of a friend. The fintech sector also uses chatbots to make consumers\u2019 inquiries and applications for financial services easier. In 2016, a small business lender in Montreal, Thinking Capital, uses a virtual assistant to provide customers with 24/7 assistance through Facebook Messenger. A small business hoping to get a loan from the company needs only answer key qualification questions asked by the bot in order to be deemed eligible to receive up to $300,000 in financing. Chatbots are convenient for providing customer service and support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They also free up phone lines and are far less expensive over the long run than hiring people to perform support. Using AI and natural language processing, chatbots are becoming better at understanding what customers want and providing the help they need. Companies also like chatbots because they can collect data about customer queries, response times, satisfaction, and so on. Chatbots, however, are still limited. Even with natural language processing, they may not fully comprehend a customer's input and may provide incoherent answers. Many chatbots are also limited in the scope of queries that they are able to respond to. This may lead to frustration with a lack of emotion, sympathy, and personalization given fairly generic feedback. In addition to customer dissatisfaction with not reaching a human being, chatbots can be expensive to implement and maintain, especially if they must be customized and updated often. Lower cost than human workers Online 24/7 Can be used as a sales & marketing tool May not understand user queries Lacks emotion and is not personalized May be expensive/complicated to install and maintain Today, chatbots are ubiquitous on corporate websites, e-commerce platforms, and other customer-facing sites online (on the web or via app). These can help with customer support such as how to return or replace an item, how to request a refund, and so on. Chatbots have also been implemented to help with public policy and inform citizens if they have certain questions. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several health chatbots were created by governments and healthcare providers. A recent study of such chatbots identified five key applications of the current health chatbots, which were: Furthermore, these technologies can ask and answer questions, create health records and history of use, complete forms and generate reports, and take simple actions. Nonetheless, the use of health chatbots poses many challenges both at the level of the social system (i.e., consumers\u2019 acceptability) as well as the technical system (i.e., design and usability). Siri is a type of chatbot that employs AI and voice-recognition software. Along with other examples like Amazon's Alexa (Echo devices) and Google Home, these are often packaged into smart speakers or mobile devices to both listen and respond in natural language. The word \"chatbot\" first appeared in 1992; however, the first chatbot is thought to be a software program called ELIZA, developed by MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum in the 1960s. ELIZA was able to recognize certain key phrases and respond with open-ended questions or comments. The intent at the time was that ELIZA could be used as sort of a therapist that could listen to peoples' problems and respond in a way that made them think that the software understood and empathized with them. You can still interact with a version of ELIZA here. Chatbots are often created for particular companies and for specific purposes. Therefore, it is difficult to rank chatbots across the board.

            "content": "Dematerialization (DEMAT) is the move from physical certificates to electronic bookkeeping. Actual stock certificates are then removed and retired from circulation in exchange for electronic recording. With the age of computers and the Depository Trust Company, securities no longer need to be in certificate form. They can be registered and transferred electronically. The introduction of dematerialization allowed for accounts to be updated automatically and swiftly. In earlier eras, transactions at stock exchanges were conducted by traders who shouted buy and sell prices. The deals were recorded on paper receipts. After the markets closed, the paperwork would continue in order to properly register all the transactions. Through dematerialization, so-called DEMAT accounts allow for electronic transactions when shares of stock are bought and sold. Within a DEMAT account, the certificates for stocks and other securities of the user are held as a means for seamless trades to be made. The introduction of dematerialization served to eliminate such a paper-oriented process. Furthermore, by adopting electronic bookkeeping, this allowed for accounts to be updated automatically and swiftly. Dematerialization applies not only to stocks, but also to other forms of investment such as bonds, mutual funds, and government securities. The use of dematerialization and DEMAT accounts is comparable to using a bank and bank accounts to maintain one\u2019s assets rather than personally storing and exchanging paper money each time a transaction is made. Using a debit card at a store creates a digital record of purchase and the amount is deducted from the cardholder\u2019s account. Funds are exchanged between buyers and sellers without paper currency. Likewise, with dematerialization, the stock transactions are completed without physical certificates. Brokers or other intermediaries will typically retain the electronic records of the transactions associated with the assets. If the holder of a physical, paper bond or other security wishes to dematerialize the document, they usually surrender the certificate with an intermediary. They should receive some sort of electronic notification that the record has been dematerialized and they may proceed with conducting transactions. Some assets\u2014for example, publicly traded shares\u2014require a DEMAT account to engage in trades and other transactions. This is because markets now operate through electronic transactions rather recorded on paper. The benefits of dematerialization can also include increased security and surety of transactions and the elimination of steps that could slow down the process of clearing transactions. Errors can be avoided that might otherwise be introduced in the handling of physical records. There might also be some savings by eliminating paperwork that may have included processing fees."

            "content": "Riskalyze was founded on the premise that an investor's risk tolerance can be quantified into a single number, which is then used to create a portfolio that matches this tolerance. It was\u00a0founded by Aaron Klein, Michael McDaniel and Matt Pistone, who shared a common vision regarding the application of\u00a0risk analysis.\u00a0Headquartered in Auburn, California, it\u00a0gained popularity with advisors who have found the single number system and easy and effective way to market products and craft client profiles.\u00a0have in the past struggled to quantify risk as a way to market products or services.\ufeff\ufeff (For more, see: Riskalyze Gets $20M Funding to Improve Advisor Tech.) The service that it provides allows advisors to ask their clients a list of questions related to financial risk and then assigns a number\u00a0based on those answers. Patented Risk Number technology harnesses a computational platform that won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2002.\ufeff\ufeff Advisors can use the numbers generated by this program to craft portfolios that contain exactly the right amount of risk. They can also use it to show clients that they may be taking more risk in their current portfolios than they realize. Riskalyze\u00a0offers a risk questionnaire. Once it is submitted, the advisor will input their client's investment choices directly into the program. Advisors find the program exceptionally useful when compiling complex data, as a single number is easier to sell than theoretical risk profiling. It is for this reason that the company found notable success in the investment advisor field. Riskalyze markets its products to Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs), independent broker-dealers, hybrid advisors, RIA networks, plan and account custodians, clearing firms and asset managers as well as local banks. The company's products helped advisors to build more than $2 billion in portfolios in 2012. There are currently no specific plans at this point to begin marketing products outside the U.S., or bring the private company public.\ufeff\ufeff (For more, read Managing Client Risk: A Look at Riskalyze.) The company also offers an automated investing program called AutoPilot, which can be used to manage both retail and retirement accounts and plans. Other products include Compliance Cloud, a comprehensive compliance program that automatically monitors an advisor's book of business and sends an alert whenever a regulation has been breached. This module allows advisors to search through their book of business and quickly find mismatched objectives and over-concentrated positions and other potential issues before they become problems. It can also help advisors to automate their workflow and intelligently prioritize their accounts according to various criteria. In addition to quantifying risk into a single number, the Riskalyze program also allows advisors to perform stress tests on a portfolio using a wide range of scenarios, such as a market crash or jump in interest rates.The stress testing tool allows clients to see where they are vulnerable in their portfolios and how they can mitigate these risks. The program's portfolio mapping module gives advisors a way to project with 95% accuracy whether a given client's portfolio will achieve the returns that the client wants. These unique tools brought significant investment interest into the company from outside sources, which amounts steadily increasing from their launch to their most recent funding round in late 2016.\ufeff\ufeff\u00a0(For more, see: Riskalyze Gets $20M Funding to Improve Advisor Tech.) In November of 2016, PIEtech announced that it is integrating its MoneyGuidePro financial planning software with Riskalyze. The integration allows users of either program to launch one system from the other.\ufeff\ufeff \u201cBy coupling the Riskalyze near-term time horizon risk profiling tools with MoneyGuidePro\u2019s holistic long-term risk profiling approach, advisors will be better able to evaluate a client\u2019s current risk exposure and true risk capacity,\u201d Kevin Knull, president of PIEtech, said in a statement.

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Regtech is the management of regulatory processes within the financial industry through technology. The main functions of regtech include\u00a0regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance. Regtech is a community of tech companies that solve challenges arising from a technology-driven economy through automation. The rise in digital products has increased data breaches, cyber hacks, money laundering, and other fraudulent activities. With the use of big data and machine-learning technology, regtech reduces the risk to a company\u2019s compliance department by offering data on money laundering activities conducted online\u2014activities that a traditional compliance team may not be privy to due to the increase of underground marketplaces online. Regtech tools seek to monitor transactions that take place online in real-time to identify issues or irregularities in the digital payment sphere. Any outlier is relayed to the financial institution to analyze and determine if fraudulent activity is taking place. Institutions that identify potential threats to financial security early on are able to minimize the risks and costs associated with lost funds and data breaches. Regtech,\u00a0or RegTech, consists of a group of companies that use cloud computing technology\u00a0through\u00a0software-as-a-service (SaaS)\u00a0to help businesses comply with regulations efficiently and less expensively. Regtech is also known as regulatory technology. Regtech companies collaborate with financial institutions and regulatory bodies, using cloud computing and big data to share information. Cloud computing is a low-cost technology wherein users can share data quickly and securely with other entities. A bank that receives huge amounts of data may find it too complex, expensive, and time-consuming to comb through. A regtech firm can combine complex information from a bank with data from previous regulatory failures to predict potential risk areas that the bank should focus on. By creating the analytics tools needed for these banks to successfully comply with the regulatory body, the regtech firm saves the bank time and money. The bank also has an effective tool to comply with rules set out by financial authorities. Financial institutions and regulators both use Regtech to deal with complicated compliance processes. Following the 2008 financial crisis ushered in an increase in financial sector regulation. There was also a rise in the disruptive use of technology within the financial sector. Technology breakthroughs led to an increase in the number of fintech companies that create technology-driven products to enhance the customer experience and engagement with financial institutions. The reliance on consumer data to produce digital products has led to concerns among regulatory bodies calling for more laws on data privacy usage and distribution. The coupling of more regulatory measures and laws with a sector more reliant on technology brought about the need for regulatory technology. As of mid-2018, deregulation in the United States\u2014as seen in the unwinding of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank)\u00a0rules\u2014has led\u00a0to a slowdown in\u00a0regtech\u00a0company financing deals, though the compliance burden should still fuel the drive toward greater automation. Some of the important characteristics of regtech include agility, speed, integration, and analytics. Regtech can quickly separate and organize cluttered and intertwined data sets through extract and transfer load technologies. Regtech can also be used to generate reports quickly. It can also be used for integration purposes to get solutions running in a short amount of time. Finally, regtech uses analytic tools to mine big data sets and use them for different purposes. Regtech operates in various spheres of the financial and regulatory space. A number of projects that regtech automates include employee surveillance, compliance data management, fraud prevention, and audit trail capabilities. A regtech business can\u2019t just collaborate with any financial institution or regulatory authority as it may have different goals and strategies that differ from the other parties. For example, a regtech that seeks to identify credit card fraud in the digital payments ecosystem may not develop a relationship with an investment firm concerned with its employees\u2019 activities online or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whose current issue may be an increase in insider trading activities. Some example of notable regtech\u00a0companies\u00a0and the tools they have created include:"

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. An eavesdropping attack, also known as a sniffing or snooping attack,\u00a0is a theft of information as it is transmitted over a network by a computer, smartphone, or another connected device. The attack takes advantage of unsecured network communications to access data as it is being sent or received by its user. Eavesdropping is a deceptively mild term. The attackers are usually after sensitive financial and business information that can be sold for criminal purposes. There also is a booming trade in so-called spouseware, which allows people to eavesdrop on their loved ones by tracking their smartphone use. An eavesdropping attack can be difficult to detect because the network transmissions will appear to be operating normally. To be successful, an eavesdropping attack requires a weakened connection between a client and a server that the attacker can exploit to reroute network traffic. The attacker installs network monitoring software, the \"sniffer,\" on a computer or a server to intercept data as it is transmitted. Amazon Alexa and Google Home are vulnerable to eavesdropping, as are any internet-connected devices. Any device in the network between the transmitting device and the receiving device is a point of weakness, as are the initial and terminal devices themselves. Eavesdropping attacks can be prevented by using a personal firewall, keeping antivirus software updated, and using a virtual private network (VPN). Using a strong password and changing it frequently helps, too. And don't use the same password for every site you log onto. Public Wi-Fi networks such as those that are available free in coffee shops and airports should be avoided, especially for sensitive transactions. They are easy targets for eavesdropping attacks. The passwords for these public networks are readily available, so an eavesdropper can simply log on and, using free software, monitor network activity and steal login credentials along with any data that other users transmit over the network. If your Facebook or email account has been hacked lately, this is probably how it happened. Virtual assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Google Home also are vulnerable to eavesdropping and their \"always-on\" mode makes them difficult to monitor for security. Some reported incidents that the companies did the snooping themselves appear to have been accidents caused by mistakes in speech recognition. Another way to limit your vulnerability to an attack is to make sure your phone is running the most recent version available of its operating system. However, its availability is up to the phone vendor, who may or may not be efficient about offering the update. Even if you do all of the above, you have to be careful from day to day. Avoid clicking on dodgy links. The sites they link to may install malware on your device. Download apps only from the official Android or Apple stores.

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. In-app purchasing refers to the buying\u00a0of goods and services from inside an application on a mobile device, such as a smartphone\u00a0or tablet. In-app purchases allow developers to provide their applications for free. The developer then advertises upgrades to the paid version, paid feature unlocks, special items for sale, or even ads other apps and services to anyone who downloads the free version. This allows the developer to profit despite giving the basic app itself away for free. In-app purchasing allows application owners the ability to upsell\u200b application users from within the application itself, rather than through other marketing channels. For example, a game application may offer the user the ability to skip a particularly difficult level for a fee or the owner may provide consumers with the ability to view premium content that is behind a pay-wall. The developer hopes to make enough money from these small transactions and the advertising revenue to cover the costs of creating and maintaining the app. The most common type of in-app purchase is to pay for the ad-free version or the full version of an app. Application stores, such as Google Play or iTunes, allow users to download applications with in-app purchasing, but they typically let the user know that an application has this feature. Some have policies allowing refunds if they are requested soon after a purchase is made. Application stores often take a percentage of the in-app sale. In-app purchases are part of a freemium model for monetizing mobile applications or content.\u00a0Consumers making purchases through an application do not have to visit a separate website to conduct the transaction. In fact, attempting to conduct a sale by redirecting to an external website\u00a0violates the terms of most application stores as it prevents them from collecting a\u00a0commission. Because in-app purchases are conducted through a mobile device, unauthorized purchases can result in security issues. This is especially the case if the username and password used in the application are not strong or credit card information is stored in the app in an insecure manner. Many applications will email a receipt after a purchase is made, which can allow\u00a0a\u00a0fraudulent purchase to be stopped. There are no overarching guidelines for in-app purchasing, but regulators have taken a keen interest in in-app purchasing. One of the primary reasons for this is that many children have access to smartphones. Many of the optimization schemes in these apps result in children making in-app purchases that their parents do not want or may not immediately notice in time to reverse. Parents, and by extension regulators, have noticed that the optimization of these in-app purchasing ads appears to target children in particular. Advertising in a way designed to take advantage of kids for a profit tends to be frowned upon, but it is governed more by ethics and codes than specific regulations or laws."

Mobile banking is the act of making financial transactions on a mobile device (cell phone, tablet, etc.). This activity can be as simple as a bank sending fraud or usage activity to a client\u2019s cell phone or as complex as a client paying bills or sending money abroad. Advantages to mobile banking include the ability to bank anywhere and at any time. Disadvantages include security concerns and a limited range of capabilities when compared to banking in person or on a computer. Mobile banking is very convenient in today\u2019s digital age with many banks offering impressive apps. The ability to deposit a check, to pay for merchandise, to transfer money to a friend or to find an ATM instantly are reasons why people choose to use mobile banking. However, establishing a secure connection before logging into a mobile banking app is important or else a client might risk personal information being compromised. Cybersecurity has become increasingly important in many mobile banking operations. Cybersecurity encompasses a wide range of measures taken to keep electronic information private and avoid damage or theft. It is also used to make data is not misused, extending from personal information to complex government systems. Three main types of cyber attacks can occur. These are: Steps financial advisors can take to protect their clients against cyber attacks include: Remittances are funds that an expatriate sends to their country of origin via wire, mail, or mobile banking (online transfer). These peer-to-peer transfers of funds across borders have enormous economic significance for many of the countries that receive them \u2013 so much so that the World Bank and the Gates Foundation have set up complex tracking mechanisms.

            "title": "Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT): Definition and How It's Used",
            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. A very small aperture terminal (VSAT) is a two-way ground station\u00a0that transmits and receives data from satellites. A VSAT is less than three meters tall and is capable of both narrow and broadband data to satellites in orbit in real-time. The data can\u00a0then be redirected to other remote terminals or hubs around the planet. VSAT\u00a0networks have a number of commercial applications, including, perhaps most notably, enterprise resource planning (ERP). The use of VSAT\u00a0to track inventory was one of the many innovations Walmart pioneered in retail to effectively manage its vast inventory in real-time and reduce delivery costs between the warehouse and\u00a0stores. Combined with the hub system of inventory storage, VSAT\u00a0allowed Walmart to stock its stores more precisely and reduce how many times a product had to move between locations before being sold. Other manufacturers use VSAT\u00a0to relay orders, check production figures in real-time as well as other functions that are otherwise\u00a0handled over a wired network. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India has one of the largest VSAT\u00a0networks in the world and offers it as one of its connectivity options. VSAT\u00a0provided the NSE with a way to offer access in areas where wired options are limited. With the exception of the occasional\u00a0sun outage due to solar radiation distorting signals from the satellite, the VSAT\u00a0network has held up. VSAT\u00a0networks have a big advantage when it comes to deployment. Because the ground station is communicating with satellites, there is less infrastructure required to service remote locations. This was one of the reasons Walmart chose VSAT\u00a0as it started out heavily leveraged to rural America, where telecommunications infrastructure was less dense than in the cities. This has made VSAT\u00a0networks an ideal choice for providing connectivity to remote work sites, such as exploratory drilling sites that need to relay daily drill logs back to headquarters. VSAT\u00a0is also independent of local telecommunications networks, making it an ideal system to back up wired systems and reduce business recovery risk. If the wired network goes down, a business can still go on using the VSAT\u00a0network. However, VSAT\u00a0does have limitations. The most obvious is latency, as it takes time for information to reach the dish and the station due to one part of the system being way up in geosynchronous\u00a0orbit above the earth. In other words, protocols that require a lot of back and forth communication rather than one-way data transfer experience lag. The signal quality can also be affected by the weather and other buildings getting in the way."

            "content": "J.B. Maverick is an active trader, commodity futures broker, and stock market analyst 17+ years of experience, in addition to 10+ years of experience as a finance writer and book editor. Traders use software programs to detect arbitrage trading opportunities they can take advantage of for potential profits. Three kinds of software programs commonly used for arbitrage trading are automatic trading software programs, alert programs, and remote alert programs. Arbitrage trading seeks to profit from temporary market inefficiencies that result in the mispricing of the same asset in different markets or at different brokers or similar assets in the market. Arbitrage trading helps to quickly correct such temporary pricing inefficiencies, bringing prices correctly back in line across various markets, brokers or different forms of the same financial asset or instrument. The temporary imbalances that form the opportunities for arbitrage trading ideally present a trader with the opportunity to make simultaneous buy-and-sell trades that lock in a small profit resulting from variations in pricing. For example, in the forex market,\u00a0there may be a slight temporary discrepancy between the exchange rate for EUR/GBP and the two currency pairs, EUR/USD and GBP/USD, that can enable a trader to profit from simultaneously selling EUR/USD and buying EUR/GBP and GBP/USD. Another example of an arbitrage trading opportunity occurs when different brokers offer slightly different bid-ask spreads that give a similar opportunity to obtain a small profit by simultaneously purchasing an asset at one broker's lower quoted price while selling it at the other broker's higher quoted price. Since arbitrage trading opportunities generally only exist for a very brief period of time\u2014often just a few seconds\u2014it is too time-consuming for traders to do arbitrage calculations on their own. Therefore, traders use a variety of software programs that can instantly detect and calculate arbitrage opportunities. One type of software program employed by arbitrage traders is automated trading software. This kind of software is loaded onto a trader's brokerage trading platform, and whenever the software program detects an arbitrage opportunity, it instantly initiates the designated trades on the trader's behalf. This type of program is designed to overcome one of the primary challenges of arbitrage trading:\u00a0the timely and accurate trade execution necessary to take advantage of trading opportunities that may only exist for a few brief seconds. Traders who are not comfortable with having trades automatically executed, preferring instead to make all final trading decisions themselves, use what is known as trade alert software. Like automatic trading software, trade alert software constantly scans different markets, instruments, and brokers for arbitrage trade opportunities. When it detects an arbitrage opportunity\u2014rather than executing the trade automatically\u2014it only signals an alert of the opportunity to the trader,\u00a0who then makes the decision whether or not to execute trades on the opportunity. Some traders, rather than running their own software programs, subscribe to a remote alert service. Subscription to the service enables them to receive arbitrage trading opportunity alert signals in the same manner as they would using their own software programs.\u00a0The difference is\u00a0that the alert signals are provided by software running at another location outside of the trader's own computer or network. Institutional traders or market makers have several advantages over retail traders in relation to arbitrage trading, including faster news sources, high-performance\u00a0computers, and more sophisticated arbitrage trading software programs. Regardless, arbitrage trading remains popular with many traders."

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. A hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet is a\u00a0digital wallet\u00a0commonly used to store the digital keys for holders of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Anyone with a copy of both the public and password-like private key can control the cryptocurrency in the account. In the cryptocurrency world, wallets contain keys instead of coins. A cryptocurrency wallet has two keys: a public key or address, which acts much like an account number, and a private key that the holder uses to transfer funds to other accounts. The private key is much like a password. Someone transferring Bitcoin from their account, for example, would use their private key to authorize the transaction. This combination of public and private keys is designed to ensure security from hackers as well as anonymity in transactions. Because the pair of keys enables the transfer of someone's cryptocurrency, it is critical that the private key remains safe. To this end, the keys are generated randomly. Each key must be backed up in the wallet to prevent it and the funds it is linked to from becoming irrevocably lost to the owner. But to ensure privacy\u2014one of the purposes driving the creation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\u2014and limit the use of public keys to one transaction each, a new pair of keys would need to be created for each transaction. This can get difficult to manage over time. Deterministic wallets were created to offer a solution, one in which all keys can be traced back to an original random seed, usually a set of random words, and a hash function. With a deterministic wallet, the original seed is enough to recover all private and public keys, therefore requiring only a single backup at the time of creation. HD Wallets are the most advanced type of deterministic wallet. They contain keys in a tree structure, in which parent keys can produce children keys, which can produce grandchildren keys, and so on, infinitely. The cryptocurrency holder can use the tree structure to organize transactions by type of transaction or by entity involved, such as departments or subsidiaries. Like simple deterministic wallets, all HD wallets are created from a single master root seed, usually represented by a mnemonic word sequence, which makes it easier for account holders to transcribe and store. But HD wallets also offer the option of creating public keys without having to access the corresponding private keys. This means they can be used on insecure servers or in a receive-only mode."

The company operates out of four offices worldwide, including its New York City headquarters, Santa Monica (CA), Jersey City (NJ), Sioux Falls (SD), and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The company went public in September 2021 at a $2.4 billion valuation. Prior to going public, among its leading investors were Blackrock, Edison Partners, and Greenspring Associates. Other backers included Fintech Collective, Grupo Sura, and Danhua Capital. These investors helped MoneyLion compete with big and small fintech competitors. As of 2024, the platform has a 4.3-star rating on TrustPilot, a popular consumer review website. The negative reviews criticize the company for problems with the handling of promotions, poor customer service, slower-than-promised fund transfers, and other account issues. The platform's growth, however, has been rapid despite these complaints. MoneyLion generates revenue through its loan business, where the company has amassed 14 million customers since launching in 2013. The company has managed to generate various accolades, including Best Financial Literacy Tool, according to Benzinga. In addition to providing tools to track spending, savings, and manage credit, the firm also offers lower-cost borrowing and investment services through its Credit Builder Plus subscription. This service offers loans up to $1000 starting at a 5.99% annual percentage rate without a credit check, payable over 12 months. Launched in December 2017, MoneyLion Plus brings investing, borrowing, and checking accounts into a single, subscription-based, membership. MoneyLion automatically withdraws $79 from a consumer's account per month, depositing $50 into their investment accounts and taking $29 as a monthly fee. Users get $1 cash back for every daily login, meaning that users who remember to sign on every day and scroll through a few screens essentially get the service for free. Its managed investment account moves saved money into a portfolio of ETFs and does not charge management fees. The startup also gets revenue from its lead generation business, by which it recommends other financial service offerings to consumers who may benefit from them. Partners include related businesses like credit monitoring firms. MoneyLion also has sponsorship deals with organizations such as NASCAR. Its partnership with NASCAR provided cash back to users who made purchases of NASCAR tickets and purchases at its tracks. MoneyLion heads off against a growing number of fintech platforms catering to consumers, including digital finance companies LearnVest, Betterment, and Intuit. Meanwhile, as new tech startups shake up the traditional banking industry, older players are going on the defensive. For example, in August 2018, JPMorgan Chase launched a no-fee app called \"You Invest,\" targeting Millennial customers who trade on their mobile devices. Other established industry leaders have followed similar fashion, with companies like Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group cutting some of their fees to zero, per the New York Business Journal.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Fees, platform features, and security are some key considerations If you\u2019d like to invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other tradable securities, you need a brokerage account to process your trades. In the past, this meant working with a human stockbroker who helped investors and traders facilitate stock trades. The internet completely transformed the industry, lowering fees and creating all kinds of options for investors. You have plenty of quality online stock brokers and trading platforms to choose from, but the right fit depends on your investment style and preferences. Read on for our complete guide to choosing an online stock broker. Each online stock broker has its own setup for investment offerings, features, fees, and customer service. Some do a better job than others, depending on what you\u2019re looking for. Our complete guide to choosing an online stock broker gives a step-by-step process to properly vet your options. There\u2019s more than one way to invest and even more ways to trade. Some investors like to keep it simple. Others try to squeeze out every edge they can to maximize profits. Different online stock brokers cater to these different audiences. Here are some of the most popular trading styles and the platforms that could make the most sense for them. Active traders spend more time researching and planning their portfolios in an attempt to earn a higher return. Active investors might day trade, use advanced strategies like scalping and swing trading, and trade more complicated assets like forex and futures. Interactive Brokers and Charles Schwab are two strong candidates for the best online stock broker for day trading, thanks to their powerful platforms, wide investment selection, and wealth of research and features. With automated trading, a computer program plans and manages your portfolio. You can also use a hybrid system, where a human advisor works with the robo-advisor. Wealthfront and Betterment are two of the best online stock brokers for automated trading. With long-term investing, you set up a portfolio on your own but don\u2019t constantly change it. You might be investing for value, buying companies you think are underpriced, or for growth, buying companies that you think have good prospects for the future. Vanguard is a good choice for investing in mutual funds, Schwab is good for investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and is the best online stock broker for beginners. Fidelity offers the best overall full-service features for investing. Once you know what investment strategy you\u2019d like to use, dive deeper into the account features of online stock brokers to inform your choice. There are different investment account types, with different rules for taxes and ownership. Brokers may not offer all possible types, which could be a factor depending on your goals. Here are the most common: Online stock brokers can offer web, desktop, and mobile-based platforms. Some offer all types, while others specialize in one or two. Consider how you prefer to track and manage your investments. What kinds of investments do you want to make for your portfolio? While some asset classes are available with any online stock broker, others are less common. Stock brokers charge fees for their services, though costs have fallen dramatically in the internet era. As part of your research, pay attention to a broker\u2019s potential fees and account requirements. You should also check whether a broker uses payment for order flow (PFOF). Some brokers offer their services practically for free, but they could potentially profit as part of executing your trades in exchange. As a result, the cheapest online stock broker might not make sense if you\u2019re using more advanced strategies where it\u2019s important to get the best terms for trade execution. Some brokers require a minimum balance to open and maintain your account. Otherwise, you could owe a monthly fee. Account minimums have become less common in the online era. Top brokers usually let you open for no minimum or only a few hundred dollars. If you\u2019d like a human advisor, minimums could be higher, in the five- or six-figure range. Online stock brokers have been aggressively lowering fees to attract more customers. You usually don\u2019t see brokers charging trade commissions or account fees. Other fees are more common. You rely on your online stock broker to provide the research and trading tools needed to build a successful portfolio. Some offer more account amenities than others. Here are a few that could be worth looking for as part of your online stock broker comparison. You need ongoing research to decide what to buy and sell for your portfolio. Some brokers offer their own proprietary research from in-house experts to guide your decisions. This includes valuations, trends, forecasts, and recommendations for your picks. Brokers could also give you access to third-party investment research websites like Morningstar and Benzinga. If you\u2019re partial to a research website, see that it\u2019s included with your broker. Charting allows you to see the price trends for a stock or other investment. Through these charts, you can potentially identify pricing patterns for trades. This strategy is called technical analysis. Some brokers offer basic charting, while others have much more serious capabilities. Screeners let you sort through many possible investment options using criteria that fit what you\u2019re looking for. For example, a stock screener could identify companies with a target price-to-earnings ratio. Some brokers have in-house proprietary screeners. Others use popular screeners from external companies like Trade Ideas, Trading View, and Zacks. Consider how you\u2019d like to deposit and withdraw money from your online stock broker. Electronic ACH transfers are usually free. If you\u2019d like to use other methods, like wire transfers, pay attention to the possible fees. You should also check how quickly deposited funds would be available for trading. Some brokers offer instant deposits, letting you trade some of the funds even before the money arrives from your bank. That way, you could take advantage of an opportunity before it disappears. It can take time for brokers to show the actual market price of investments. There\u2019s usually a 15-minute or so delay. If you\u2019re an active trader where every minute counts, you could look for a broker that provides real-time quotes. Some brokers offer real-time quotes for free while others charge for this service. Brokers have different speeds for executing your investment orders. If you plan on using more advanced strategies that depend on order timing, search for a broker that specializes in fast execution. Traditional markets for stocks, bonds, and ETFs are open during regular business hours: Monday through Friday, 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. ET. However, some brokers offer extended-hour trading outside these hours, which could be appealing depending on when you like to invest. Paper trading allows you to build a portfolio using play money. Backtesting lets you set up a strategy and see how it would have performed according to historical data. Both could be useful if you\u2019re still learning and want to experiment. If so, look for a broker that offers these capabilities. Order types let you set up possible trades and under what circumstances they go through. Some brokers only offer basic order types, while others offer more options. Consider whether you need more than the basics. Basic order types are: Advanced order types are: Check out the possible ways to reach customer service and the hours of support at a broker. Make sure that you are comfortable with the options. For example, is it online-only, or can you speak to someone over the phone? You should also check whether you can get help from licensed brokers or financial advisors. Brokers can provide numerous educational materials to help investors improve their trades and portfolios. Consider how you\u2019d like to learn and ensure these options are available. Some popular education options include: You depend on a broker to safeguard your investments and money. The government regulates stock brokers through agencies like FINRA and the SEC. If a broker breaks regulations\u2014for example, misleads you on costs or mishandles trade execution\u2014it could be fined and pay restitution to you as an investor. Still, it\u2019s better to do your research first and make sure to work with a broker that\u2019s legit. In addition, brokers must have the following insurance to protect your funds: Brokers should properly protect your account against identity theft and theft of assets. Data breaches have been known to happen, where brokers lose sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII). Make sure your broker has appropriate online security measures, including: Once you find a broker that looks promising, you should take it for a test drive. Many brokers let you set up an account with no minimum deposit. You can see how the trading platform works and get a feel for what it would be like to invest. You could also contact each company and see if it offers some sort of demo on how to use the platform. That way, you can make an informed choice before investing money. After completing all the steps in the complete guide to choosing an online broker, you should be ready to make your selection. You\u2019ll need to finish setting up your account and make your first deposit so you can start investing for real. Remember, you aren\u2019t limited to just one online broker. You could split your portfolio between a broker with a great robo-advisor and a broker that is better for active day trading. If you aren\u2019t happy with your selection later, you could transfer your money and portfolio to a new broker. While there might be a transfer fee, the new company may cover it on your behalf to land your business. When you pick an online stock broker, you\u2019re hopefully launching a relationship you can count on for years. Don\u2019t rush into the first option you see. By comparing the fees, investment options, platforms, and account amenities, you can feel confident in your research and selection.

            "title": "8 Best Cloud Storage Solutions for Small Business",
            "content": "These days,\u00a0small businesses increasingly need access to their\u00a0data on the go, with no overhead for storage maintenance and no hardware maintenance costs. Cloud storage provides an efficient solution and is rapidly gaining in popularity. This article explores the cloud-hosting concept and looks at some top cloud-hosting providers for small-business needs. Before cloud computing, individuals stored\u00a0their personal data on hard drives and memory cards. But computers and mobile phones can be easily damaged or lost, and may require physical proximity to the device in order to access the stored data. Businesses have stored their data on large-sized servers hosted in dedicated data centers. Data can only be accessed by a user who logs in to the corporate network, and it may not be accessible via the Internet or when the user is on the move. Both the individual devices and the corporate servers need dedicated support and maintenance, and ensuring the security of the data remains a challenge. A cloud service provider or a cloud hosting company provides a fixed-size server space to clients, who use it to store data. While the client owns the stored data, the hosting company owns and maintains the required hardware. The cloud host offers non-stop\u00a0accessibility to client data, while providing secure access as designated by the clients. The data, in turn, may be stored across one or many servers, configured by the cloud hosting company in their data centers. Although this concept dates back to the 1960s, it has gained popularity in the last few years due to improved Internet infrastructure allowing faster access to remotely hosted data. Businesses have increasingly relied on cloud hosting, as it does away with\u00a0the hassles of local server maintenance, associated costs, and certain security concerns. The growing\u00a0market of cloud hosting includes big names like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and\u00a0giants like\u00a0Intel are reportedly\u00a0investing heavily in supporting technologies. This article lists the top eight cloud service providers. Our list is arranged in alphabetical order, with pricing details as available at the time of publication. In the technology world, \u201cfree offers\u201d often come with lots of restrictions. For free cloud storage, this means limits on the size and type of data that can be hosted, bandwidth utilization, platforms (Windows or Linux), availability of backups, and technical support. This may be fine for individual users, but small businesses will likely need to pay for a service that will meet their needs. While there are plenty of good options, you'll certainly want to do your homework before trusting your business data to any provider.

            "title": "Is Apple Pay Safe?",
            "content": "Apple Pay is a mobile payment system that as of 2024 is in use by an estimated 60.2 million users in the US. An article from Oberlo forecasts that the number will grow to an estimated 67.0 million in 2026. As for whether it's safe or not, Apple Pay is certainly safer to use than cash. And, it should be safer to use than plastic, as long as the account owner enables its full safety features. Apple Pay can be used to complete a transaction at any merchant, web retailer, or app that accepts it. In addition, it allows users to send and receive money from other users via messaging. Each transaction incorporates a number of security measures: Apple promises never to share card information across its cloud. While this means users have to manually enter their card information into each device, it adds to the security of the service. Needless to say, Apple Pay and its competitors face a constant assault from hackers eager to scale its security walls. So far, these attempts appear to have uncovered vulnerabilities created by users but not by Apple. One report indicates that wi-fi hotspots may be used to intercept and reuse encrypted transaction data. One unconfirmed report claims that Apply Pay could make it easier to exploit stolen identities. That is, a criminal could simply load stolen information, including credit card numbers, into an iPhone and go on a shopping spree. (This actually would be the responsibility of the bank that issued the stolen card, not Apple.) Another unconfirmed report claims that \"white hat\" hackers were able to infect a device with malware and then intercept payment data as it was entered by an iPhone user and sent to the Apple server. This could only be done on a \"jailbroken\" iPhone, meaning one with software that had been tampered with. Yet another report claims that users of wi-fi hotspots are vulnerable to hackers who can intercept and reuse the cryptogram that is used to enable an Apple Pay transaction. Yes, the cryptogram is supposed to be usable only once, but apparently some merchants allow them to be used more than once. Another example of an error that exploits imperfect use of the Apple Pay system. Oberlo. \"How Many People Use Apple Pay in the US?

            "title": "The Future of Fintech",
            "content": "Fintech Used To Be a Back-Office Support Function, Now It's Defining an Industry Rockaa / Getty Images Fintech is short for financial technology. It refers to companies that mainly use technology to provide financial services to customers. Today, companies across all industries are eager to embed financial services into their products and apps to keep customers engaged and earn fees from their transactions. By integrating features like mobile payments, lending, or investment tools directly into their platforms, businesses can tap into new revenue streams, boost customer loyalty, and gain a competitive edge. Banks large and small are rethinking their businesses by integrating more digital products into their central operations and services. Over the next decade, private venture capital and other major investors will continue pouring funding into financial technology or fintech. It's easy to see why. Major investors and banks are pouring capital into fintech for the same reason Willie Sutton, the infamous 1930s bank robber, targeted banks: \"because that's where the money is.\" As we reviewed academic studies and consulting firm reports and dug deeper into the data on changes in this area to predict the future of fintech, we reached out to Joris Hensen, founder and co-lead, and Brigitte K\u00f6tting, communications manager, of Deutsche Bank's (DB) division overseeing its application programming interfaces (APIs). They've been working at helping their bank\u2014formed in 1870\u2014remake itself through embedded finance (applications placed seamlessly into platforms often used by clients) and fintech more broadly. Hensen and K\u00f6tting said these changes should be \"understood as a transformation\" of DB. DB, like other large banks, has been working for some time on the \"technical building blocks\" unseen by consumers, but they said it's concentrating \"more strongly than before on reusable services... ultimately, the biggest transformations\" will be from how banking services are customized to the individual. The efforts of DB and others are among the reasons fintech is now simply a part of people's lives. Chatbots, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, crypto assets, robo-advisors, and all forms of digital banking are no longer the future but the present. If this is the present, what does the future of fintech look like? Below, we explore open banking frameworks, the rise of AI, mobile-first banking, and other trends likely to gain steam in the coming years. A Harris Poll/Plaid survey found that three-quarters of consumers use digital payment services, up about a third since 2020, with the average consumer using three to four financial apps each. Fintech has been transforming how we manage, invest, and spend our money (and even what we consider money with the rise of cryptocurrencies). This blend of finance and technology is redefining the financial industry, offering consumers and businesses more accessible and cost-effective services. When fintech, the term, emerged a few decades ago, it typically referred to technologies enabling ATMs and the like, as well as other backend financial operations. But in the last decade, developments have been far more directed toward consumer-facing technologies and have found uses in retail shopping, education, fundraising, and community nonprofits. You no longer need to visit a bank branch to apply for credit or wait in line to transfer money\u2014people mostly do this from home now. As a World Bank report puts it, \"Fintech\u00a0is transforming the financial sector landscape rapidly and is blurring the boundaries of both financial firms and the financial sector.\" By the mid-2020s, however, fintech has come to mean everything\u2014or worse, anything. But once we get specific (not just marketing), we notice genuine trends in AI, automated financial planning (robo-advising), banking, cryptocurrencies, digital lending, lending marketplaces and crowdfunding platforms, financial e-learning, insurance, money transfers, mortgages, payments, and savings and investments. About a third of all investments in equity fintech funding each year come from venture capitalists\u2014they provide capital to startup companies and small businesses with long-term growth potential in exchange for equity stakes. Globally, Chinese and Southeast Asian tech firms have had the most success with highly popular super-apps and hundreds of millions of users. Because of that growth, North America, which in 2023 accounted for about half of worldwide fintech revenues, is expected to fall to about 40% in that category. That's not because North America will be standing still\u2014indeed, investments in other parts of the world will often come from firms based there\u2014but because the growth is expected to be more rapid in these areas. For example, today, almost half of adults in Brazil bank with Nubank (a fintech), double the amount in 2020. Emerging markets worldwide are likely to power much of the growth in fintech. McKinsey, the consulting and research firm, expects Africa, Asia-Pacific (excluding China), Latin America, and the Middle East to double their aggregate share of the world's fintech revenue (about a third) by 2028. Significant shifts are thus in regions where large population segments have historically been excluded from the traditional banking system. Mobile banking apps and financial technologies have emerged in these areas as everyday payment methods. The Chinese company Tencent Holding's WeChat (with over a billion users) is just one of many messaging apps worldwide that have evolved into offering services like social media, mobile payments, and digital banking. Various applications provide essential services such as money transfers, microloans, and access to nontraditional credit sources. More than the efforts of the major European and American banks, it's remarkable how many of the changes in fintech are being led from below. Nevertheless, this shouldn't lead us to celebrate the \"democratization\" of finance too quickly. Much of the investment capital (and, therefore, the rewards likely to be gained) originates in the developed world. The future of finance is likely to occur with mobile banking and digital payments leading the charge. The pandemic caused a massive shift as consumers and businesses sought contactless payment options and remote banking services that have remained in place since. While there have been vast changes in how consumers pay each other for goods and services, it's been a different story for businesses paying each other (B2B). S&P Global calls this the \"final frontier\" for this part of fintech, as many companies still rely on paper checks, and their payment processes can often be slow and complicated. Their research shows that almost half of small and medium-sized businesses think they rely too much on manual processes, and managing cash flow automatically is still a significant challenge. Fintech firms are increasingly focused on this area\u2014in recent years, about two-thirds of global fintech companies have been in the B2B market\u2014and we should expect new B2B platforms and tools to have far wider use. Research by McKinsey contends that fintech revenues will grow almost three times faster than those in the traditional banking sector from 2024 to 2028. Changes are also being pushed top-down. Regulators have been stepping in to get more uptake of real-time instant payments (with optional antifraud tools) in the banking industry. The Federal Reserve launched FedNow in 2023, enabling banks and credit unions to send and receive payments for their customers in real-time every day. In Europe, the EU's plan to mandate Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) instant payments, which have been available for about a decade, could bring down the costs of these transfers while also leveling the playing field further between banks and nonbanks. Below are specific technological changes underway in banking and payments: AI is arguably the most transformative technology shaping the future of fintech. McKinsey estimates that AI could generate up to $1 trillion in additional revenues annually for the global banking industry. Here are some ways AI is seen as key in fintech: The integration of AI in fintech is not without many challenges. Concerns about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and job losses to AI are likely to remain live issues for the foreseeable future. Biometric authentication, such as fingerprint and facial recognition, adds more security to digital payments. This technology is becoming more sophisticated and user-friendly, which could lead to broader adoption in mobile banking and payment apps. By eliminating the need for passwords and PINs, biometrics could solve identification issues with fintech apps but could also bring on others involving privacy. Buy now, pay later (BNPL) has proliferated since the pandemic as an alternative form of short-term credit, primarily for buying online. Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) are just two of the major firms that entered this market in the 2020s. While BNPL has existed in the U.S. for some time, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) thinks that the number of BNPL customers could triple by 2027 from its 50 million figure in 2021. BNPL's business model relies on charging merchants fees, though late consumer fees can pile up quickly. Lenders market BNPL to merchants as a way to drive sales, which could create incentives for BNPL lenders and their partners to encourage customers to spend far more. The CFPB has raised concerns about overspending and financial harm, especially as BNPL is marketed more as a budgeting tool than a form of credit, which the CFPB thinks is behind the widespread use of it by people who already have credit through other means. Since 2022, the CFPB has been reviewing extending credit card regulations to BNPL lenders. In late 2023, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued guidance on BNPL lending to community banks, which included steps to protect borrowers from manipulation and outright fraud. \"A common misconception of buy now, pay later borrowers is that they lack access to other forms of credit. Our analysis shows that these borrowers are more likely\" to have other forms of credit, said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. \u201cSince buy now, pay later is like other forms of credit, we are working to ensure that borrowers have similar protections and that companies play by similar rules.\u201d The convenience of mobile payments and banking continues to redefine financial transactions, making them more accessible and secure. Mobile wallets, such as those from Apple, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), and various payment apps, are fast becoming the primary payment method for many consumers. Mobile wallets also include those for trading and holding cryptocurrencies. Popular mobile wallets like the Crypto.com DeFi Wallet and Trust Wallet support multiple cryptocurrencies, allowing users to trade digital assets or make payments from their smartphones. In addition, many wallets integrate with decentralized finance platforms, enabling users to participate in lending, staking, and other yield-generating activities. Below are the results of data from Worldpay LLC for 2023 and its forecast for how payments will look in 2027. Despite the hoopla surrounding crypto in recent years, what's also notable is that crypto-based payments are missing from this list as Worldpay doesn't expect them to break 1% of global payments by then. Open banking enables the secure sharing of customer data and initiating payments through Application Programming Interface APIs. This benefits fintech startups like Plaid and Tink, which can offer financial services and data research by accessing consumers' banking information. While this could provide consumers with greater convenience, it could also increase security risks for the data that's shared. Regulators have been attempting to speed up the rollout of open banking with the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) in Europe, the Open Banking regulation in the U.K., the Consumer Data Right in Australia, and similar frameworks elsewhere. These mandates require banks to share customer data with licensed third parties with customer consent. In the U.S., there's no equivalent to these open banking regulations. Nevertheless, several initiatives dovetail with them. Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandates that financial institutions provide consumers with access to their financial data. There's also been an industry-led initiative, Financial Data Exchange, to work out common standards for securely sharing data across the industry. This leads us to banking as a service (BaaS, not to be confused with blockchain as a service), which is when nonbanks offer banking services to their customers through APIs with licensed partner banks. Fintech startups and established giants can use these APIs to embed financial services like checking accounts, payment processing, and lending into their products and services. For consumers, it can mean a more seamless way to tap into banking services through platforms they already use daily. Hensen and K\u00f6tting said the EU's open banking initiatives are part of the background as DB's fintech products have evolved. They think it can handle problems traditional banking couldn't. \"Embedded finance has great potential to empower 'unbanked' target groups... But whether it's offering banking services through mobile wallets or providing microfinance options, e.g. within agricultural supply chains, embedded finance can help bridge the gap between banks and underserved individuals and communities.\" Banks will need to reach out to major players in other sectors, they suggested, since they will have better expertise for enabling banking services in those areas. P2P lending platforms connect borrowers with lenders who are willing to provide loans at agreed-upon interest rates. This option is attractive for borrowers who may not qualify for traditional loans because of strict banking regulations or lower credit scores. Investors, meanwhile, could earn higher returns compared with traditional savings and investments, although this comes with great risk. The digital transformation in fintech has led to the development of personalized investment platforms that cater to novices and seasoned investors alike. This shift combines two ideas usually opposed, automation and personalization, as platforms like Betterment and Wealthfront employ algorithms to tailor investment portfolios to individual risk tolerances and financial goals. Online trading platforms have increased access to financial markets, allowing individuals to trade stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies. Platforms like Robinhood and eToro have benefited from these trends. As financial services become even more digital, security remains a major concern. The sector is countering threats with sophisticated cybersecurity measures. It also faces AI-driven attacks and more; the same tech enabling improvements in fintech is also being used to hack into these services. As we look ahead, several key trends are shaping how money is used and what it is. Unlike decades ago, when moving capital from one country to another would require countless intermediaries, capital now moves instantaneously across many parts of the world. Digital banking and payment platforms like PayPal, Stripe, and cryptocurrencies allow instant, low-cost international money transfers, dramatically increasing the speed and ease of moving money globally\u2014often, regulators worry, anonymously. The digitalization of money is being pulled in two directions: Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that would centralize them under national authorities and cryptocurrencies that move away from them. One of the most significant developments in recent years has been the rise of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained mainstream attention and adoption, offering a decentralized and peer-to-peer alternative to traditional fiat currencies, if not as money to be exchanged, at least as speculative investments. At the heart of crypto's appeal is blockchain technology, a digital ledger consisting of connected blocks that record transactions across many computers. Regulators worldwide are grappling with whether and how to integrate cryptocurrencies within their systems while protecting consumers. In addition, the market's volatility and propensity for fraud remain significant hurdles for mainstream acceptance of directly holding cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, crypto has unquestionably moved into mainstream investing with the advent of crypto futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2021 and spot bitcoin ETFs and spot ether ETFs in 2024. Much of the world has liberalized its financial markets in recent decades, reducing controls on capital flows to encourage foreign investment. Interbank networks like SWIFT enable secure and fast financial communication and transactions between banks worldwide. It's this context, along with the rise of crypto, that has caused CBDCs to leap quickly from the pages of academic papers describing them theoretically to use in the real world. The emergence of CBDCs\u2014essentially digital forms of national fiat currencies\u2014is clearly in response to crypto's success among many. They are meant to provide the benefits of crypto while \"maintain[ing] the centrality of safe and trusted central bank money in a rapidly digitizing economy,\" as the U.S. Federal Reserve put it in a 2022 report. It's not just the U.S. Federal Reserve looking at CBDCs, but also the European Central Bank and People's Bank of China, among others, reviewing the potential for CBDCs. They are now in use in the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria. The U.S. Federal Reserve report noted that the adoption of CBDCs could bring several advantages: However, regulators still have concerns about CBDCs related to privacy, cybersecurity, and how vast amounts of digital money moving around could affect the banking system. Global fintech funding fell to a five-year low in 2023, with $114 billion from 4,547 deals. Venture capital flows fell 42% to $35 billion. Regtech, short for regulatory technology, is the part of fintech that uses newer technologies to navigate the complex rules and regulations that financial institutions must adhere to. Here are some principal aspects of it: Regtech companies include ComplyAdvantage, which offers a risk management platform for AML and KYC compliance; Suade Labs, which provides a regulatory reporting platform that helps financial institutions meet their regulatory obligations; and Onfido, which focuses on verifying identities using AI and biometrics. Short for \"insurance technology,\" this is technology designed to squeeze efficiency from the traditional insurance industry model. It includes using big data analytics to personalize insurance policies, AI to automate claims processing, and Internet of Things devices to monitor and manage risk in real time. According to Hourly, there are over 3,400 insurtech companies, up from 1,500 companies in 2018. Neobanking, also known as challenger banking, is a type of digital bank that operates only online or through mobile apps. In the U.S., neobanks include Chime, which offers fee-free banking, early direct deposit, and automatic savings; Varo, which provides checking and savings accounts and high-yield savings options; and SoFi, which offers financial products, including student loan refinancing, personal loans, investments, in addition to banking services. Yes. After the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, there were expectations the same may soon occur with ether, the Ethereum platform's in-house cryptocurrency. A spot ether ETF holds the digital tokens directly, not just futures contracts tied to their value, as is presently the case with ether futures ETFs, which began trading in 2023. In May 2024, the SEC approved applications from Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE to list spot ETFs tied to the price of ether. In July 2024, the SEC approved applications from several ETF issuers and allowed spot ether ETFs to begin trading. The future of fintech will likely include significant expansion in the next few years. As consumer demand for convenient digital financial apps rises and traditional financial institutions increasingly partner with or adopt fintech offerings, the line between fintech startups and established players will blur quickly. Emerging technologies like blockchain, AI, and machine learning are poised to drive further changes in how payments are made, how money is lent, how funds are invested, and how customer service is done. Open banking initiatives and embedded finance products will increasingly integrate financial services seamlessly into nonfinancial platforms. Meanwhile, regulators are not stepping back, at least for now. Indeed, contrary to the typical story that regulators are holding back innovation, U.S. and EU regulators have been pushing for banks to provide consumers with more real-time payment options. As AI is further integrated into financial systems, further industry automation is likely\u2014as are AI-backed attacks on banking data. That's why risk management is also a significant aspect of fintech's future.

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Circle is a Boston-based financial services company that uses blockchain technology for its peer-to-peer payments and cryptocurrency-related products. It was started in 2013 by Jeremy Allaire, who previously founded Brightcove, a video platform company, and Sean Neville. Circle started as a consumer peer-to-peer cryptocurrency payments and exchange platform, sponsoring the popular cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex after the exchange experienced hardship in 2017, which was later spun out in October 2019. In 2016 the company stopped offering its cryptocurrency wallet services. In June 2019, it was announced that Circle Pay mobile and related web apps would be discontinued. In 2020, the company's focus shifted to its stablecoin as \"programmable dollars\" for business use. In 2021, Circle was acquired by Concord Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), in a deal valued at $4.5 billion. The deal will take the company public in late 2021 under the ticker symbol 'CRCL'. Circle's website states that its mission is to change the global economy. The company's first product was an app called Circle Pay. The app\u00a0was a bitcoin trading exchange. In September 2015, Circle Pay was granted a BitLicense, New York state's license for operating bitcoin exchanges. In May of 2021, the company announced it had raised $440 million in financing from institutional and strategic investors. In 2018, Circle had raised $110 million in venture capital to create a stablecoin on Ethereum\u00a0coin backed by U.S. dollars, known as USD Coin (USDC). The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) granted Circle an electronic money license. In December 2016, Circle Pay's focus shifted to peer-to-peer payments or \"global social payments.\"\u00a0Circle also launched an open-source software project in 2017 to promote payment technology. Circle\u2019s main product was an app called Circle Pay that enabled instant and free money transfers between individuals. The service was similar to Paypal\u2019s Venmo in that it could be used for daily transactions, such as splitting meal costs or making rent payments. The Circle Pay app was popular with Millennials in Europe. According to the company, 90% of its European customers in 2017 were below 35 years of age, and 60% were younger than 25 years old.\u00a0In June 2017, Circle Pay announced the integration of a free money transfer service between the United States and Europe. While announcing the launch, Circle founder Allaire said the company was working towards realizing its vision of no distinction between international and domestic money transfers. The circle app is no longer supported. Circle's open source project is called Centre and is named after the Cent Routing Exchange protocol it uses. Transfers within the app take place using Centre tokens (CENT), an Ethereum token. The project enables transfers between consumer digital wallets that support different currencies. It is also intended to help financial services companies to comply with existing regulations, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML), by enabling disclosure. The project supports transfers in many countries around the world. For example, a user in the U.K. can convert British pounds to Korean won\u00a0and transfer them to a digital wallet user in Korea\u00a0using the app.\u00a0Centre currently runs on Ethereum's blockchain but is designed to run on other blockchains as well. Circle's products are freely available in app stores, and the company does not charge fees for transactions or transfers. It makes money through the trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in over-the-counter (OTC) markets and at digital exchanges. In an August 2017 tweet, Allaire said Circle was the second biggest crypto asset trader in the world. The company trades in bitcoin and ether and is a market maker on all major exchanges. It also provides OTC liquidity services to institutions. In the future, it may launch products that generate revenue. \"We will have future, higher-level products that we fully intend to be revenue-generating, but this first basic product needs to be free,\" co-founder Sean Neville stated in a 2014 blog post. Circle also earns revenue from the reserve balances that it holds for its customers. The company invests their clients' balances and pays them interest from those investments but takes a portion of the rate as revenue via an interest rate spread. Circle processed $1 billion in transactions per month as of 2017, according to a statement from Allaire. It entered China, a massive market for payment apps, starting in 2016. The company\u2019s focus in China is to \u201cconnect Chinese consumers to the rest of the world\u201d by enabling the flow of payments going out or into China. For example, it could more easily facilitate money transfer operations for Chinese students studying abroad. Circle\u2019s technology of using blockchain-based tokens is similar to that of Ripple, which is another company focused on reducing the cost of international money transfers. However, both apps target different markets. Ripple is working with banking institutions to implement its technology. Circle. \"What Is Circle Pay? Accessed Oct. 1, 2021.

            "title": "Digital Transaction Definition, How It Works, Benefits",
            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. A digital transaction is a seamless system involving one or more participants, where transactions are effected without the need for cash. The digital transaction involves a constantly evolving\u00a0way of doing things where financial technology (fintech) companies\u00a0collaborate with various sectors of the economy for the purpose of meeting the increasingly sophisticated demands of the growing tech-savvy users. As the needs of investors and financial service users become more complex, there is a demand for effective tools to simplify the processes and transactions carried out by end-users. It is inevitable that financial institutions would have to increase the number of digitized services and offerings, given a rise in the use of automated services. Implementing technology in the financial industry\u00a0is a necessity for the survival of businesses as customers seek lower-cost alternatives to traditional financial services. Fintech companies have led the revolution in transforming the financial sector by digitalizing the end-client\u2019s transactional eco-system. Digital transactions involve the execution of multiple transactions by multiple companies, all completed in the span of a few seconds. A digital transaction converts a traditional cash-operational society to a cashless one. It can be anything from paying for goods at a brick-and-mortar store to transferring money online to making investment trades. Here's an example of an everyday transaction that looks quite simple but is actually embedded with digital intricacies every step of the way: Jane pays cash every time she goes to the grocery store (Fresh Chain). This means that every time she runs out of cash, she has to make a trip to her bank (Future Bank) in order to replenish her wallet. Unfortunately, if she needs some cash after closing hours or on a weekend, she will have to wait until the next workday when Future Bank is open for business. To include Jane in the digital finance world, Future Bank gives Jane a debit card linked automatically to her checking account. The next time Jane goes grocery shopping at Fresh Chain, she swipes her card through a hand-held payment processing device known as a Point of Sale (POS). The payment is made in seconds and Jane goes home satisfied. Now let\u2019s look at the behind-the-scenes digital transaction. The debit card issued to Jane is a Visa card. Visa creates cards like Jane\u2019s which has a magnetic stripe that stores information digitally. When Jane swipes the magnetic stripe against the POS or payment processor, the transaction information is transferred to Visa. The payment processor acts as the intermediary between Visa and Fresh Chain. Visa makes note of the information received from the payment processor and forwards it to Future Bank for approval. Future Bank confirms that Jane has the necessary funds in her checking account to complete her purchase and authorizes the transaction. Visa then relays this information through the POS machine as an authorized transaction. The exact amount of the transaction is debited from Jane\u2019s checking account and a percentage of this amount, say 98%, is credited to Fresh Chain\u2019s account. The remaining 2% is shared between Future Bank and Visa as their fee. Although the process seems lengthy, it actually happens in seconds. The example of a digital transaction above was made to show how the benefits of technology adaptation outweigh the costs for businesses, financial institutions, and end-users. Still, there are digital initiatives that come up to disrupt the previous digital transaction setups. Just as credit cards are disrupting the use of cash, processes like online transactions and cryptocurrencies are disrupting the regimen where physical presence and credit cards, respectively, are required for transactions. The e-commerce portal has provided a means by which buyers and sellers can engage in digital transactions; cloud service platforms have provided a digital process for storing data; crowdfunding gateways have provided a means by which individuals and startups can have access to funds; peer-to-peer lending forums have provided a way for individuals to lend to and borrow from each other without the hassles of the traditional banking regulation; roboadvising tools have provided a way for individuals to plan their retirement phase; etc. These all constitute digital transactions that may eventually get disrupted by new inventions over the years."

            "title": "How Splitwise Makes Money",
            "content": "Splitwise is a free app that allows consumers to split expenses with friends. If a group needs to share the cost of a particular bill, Splitwise ensures that anyone who pays is reimbursed the correct amount and with a minimal number of transactions. With Splitwise, users can send an email notification when a bill is due, and the app allows users to send an IOU to someone else in the group. The app is marketed to keep track of informal debts, including the cost of rent, dining and travel expenses, bills, and more. Users of Splitwise enter notes into the app about who they owe, who owes them, and why. This service eliminates the need to keep receipts because a user can add any expense to the app when the cost is incurred. \u201cWith Splitwise, users can make payments via online payment services like Paypal and Venmo, which may charge a fee for specific debit card and credit card transactions. Splitwise also offers Splitwise Pay for direct payments from the app through a connected bank account. Splitwise Pro is a paid upgrade (approximately $3 to $5 a month) to existing Splitwise accounts, available for a variable monthly or annual rate depending upon when the account was established, the country, local taxes and regulations, and more. Pro users see reduced advertisements, a receipt scanning and itemization service, currency conversion, expense search, early access to new features, and more. Splitwise is used via a mobile app and web platform that uses fintech software. This thriving industry offers users technology to help them enhance or automate financial transactions. A bill-splitting app, it operates in the same realm as its competitors like Tab, Settle Up, and Splid, which all offer similar services that provide easy ways to split up bills and pay debts within groups. Splitwise, when used in conjunction with Venmo or Paypal, allows users to jettison paper money in favor of digital transactions. The global fintech industry has a long reach. According to Plaid, nearly nine out of 10 consumers had adopted a form of fintech into their lives by 2021. Public data regarding the company's user base is unavailable. Still, Splitwise has generated more than $30 million in investor funding over six rounds since its founding in 2011, suggesting outside interest in supporting the company's growth. In the sixth round of funding in April 2021, according to Crunchbase, the company raised $20 million. Splitwise may receive a portion of transaction fees paid by the user to facilitate payment transfers via PayPal or debit and credit cards. Still, it isn't easy to assess just how significant this source of revenue may be for the company, or even if it can be considered a major revenue stream, as Splitwise does not have publicly available financial reports. Nonetheless, because the transactions do not occur within the app itself, Splitwise can keep its service free to the user\u2014even if payments themselves incur separate fees to settle up debts owed. The cloud-based Splitwise app is available for iPhones, Android devices, and computers. Splitwise as a free limited app makes money through occasional advertisements. Its paid subscription upgrade service, called Splitwise Pro, is ad-free and unlocks advanced features. Although company documentation suggests that users of Splitwise's free service may experience advertisements, in reality, ads seem to appear sparingly, if at all. Because the company does not provide public financials, it is difficult to assess if Splitwise earns significant revenue from advertisements and, if so, what these figures may be. Plates by Splitwise is a separate free app offered through Splitwise that simplifies the process of splitting up a restaurant bill. This app allows diners to enter each dish ordered and split the cost of shared items, such as appetizers. The Plates app calculates the tax and tip, and each person in the group receives an email notification of the amount owed. This service can also link with the Splitwise app. The Providence, Rhode Island-based company was founded by Jonathan Bittner, Marshall Weir, and Ryan Laughlin, who handles the web design and development, in 2011. According to his bio, Bittner, a former astrophysics graduate student at Harvard, was interested in creating an app to assist quantitative fairness. The company aims to provide \"mediation advice about fairness.\" While the backstory isn't on the website, users can search through the archives of the company's blog posts back to 2011 to understand how they operate and create. As a free app, Splitwise does not charge users to download or utilize basic limited service and offers a service called Splitwise Pro for approximately $5 a month. In 2019, the company refreshed and redesigned its entire platform, including the homepage, logo, and mobile app. Company documentation suggests that users may see advertisements in the course of utilizing Splitwise, providing one source of revenue for the company. In April 2021, Splitwise Inc. announced they had raised $20 million in Series A funding led by global venture capital and private equity firm\u00a0Insight Partners. According to a company-approved press release, Splitwise will \"use the funding to grow its team, accelerate global customer growth, and create new partnerships with fintech and financial services platforms.\" Since its inception,\u00a0$90 billion\u00a0in total transactions have been split on the Splitwise platform, and in April 2021, Splitwise launched a significant refresh of its Android app. The new round of funding for Splitwise indicates a continued demand by consumers for fintech applications. Splitwise does not provide exact metrics on its active users, but the company appears poised to grow, and an app that helps groups of friends and family keep track of money owed, most likely will continue to be in demand. You can use Splitwise using its mobile app on your phone. It acts as a digital IOU, and it easily calculates what each person in a group owes. You can also make payments using third-party apps like Venmo or through a linked checking account via your Splitwise app. Splitwise is free for limited use but you can sign up for Splitwise Pro for around $5 a month. You cannot link Splitwise to a bank account as it does not support cash transactions. Splitwise only keeps track of expenditures and IOU debts. Splitwise offers a range of fairness calculators on its website from a calculator for splitting the rent to a travel calculator. Splitwise does not handle any cash transactions, nor does it link to personal banking details, making it safer than other apps. SettleUp, Tab, and Splid are all similar to Splitwise.

            "url": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rate-of-adoption.asp",
            "title": "Rate of Adoption: How it Works, Examples",
            "content": "Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. The rate of adoption is the pace at which a new technology is acquired and used by the public. This rate can be represented by the number of members of a society who start using a new technology or innovation during a specific period of time. The rate of adoption is useful for making comparisons. One group's rate is compared to the adoption rate of another, often of the entire society. The adoption rate is part of the diffusion of innovations theory. That theory seeks to explain how the use of new technologies, processes, and innovations spread through a society, and why they are adopted over old methods. It often determines when and how early adopters exist as well. Network effects strongly influence the rate of adoption. Many technologies become more useful as other people adopt them. These technologies are said to benefit from network effects. The rapid growth of the Internet is perhaps the best-known example of a network effect boosting the rate of adoption. Between 1969 and 1994, the Internet was mostly used by the U.S. military and academics, with limited adoption elsewhere. The difficulty of accessing the Internet over the command-line text-based Telnet protocol limited the rate of adoption. As the Internet became easier to use thanks to web browsers, the rate of adoption increased, and more services sprung up. However, computer equipment still cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars in the 1990s and required some skill to set up. There was concern over a digital divide in the early 21st century, as the poor often lacked access to the Internet. Fortunately, smartphones brought hardware costs down below $50 and also made getting on the Internet easier. The result was a higher rate of adoption among the poor. Attributes of an innovation that affect the rate of adoption include the advantages of adopting the innovation and the ease with which it can be added to daily life. Furthermore, the ability of other members of society to see those who have already adopted the innovation and the expense associated with trying the innovation also impact the adoption rate. Another major factor that influences the rate of adoption is the type of society that is being introduced to an innovation. Closed cultures and societies without clear communication between adopters and non-adopters are less likely to take on a new technology. Rates of adoption vary dramatically over time and go down as well as up. Facebook is an example where status emulation and network effects combined to create a high rate of adoption. Facebook started as a way for Harvard students to network. It later spread to other colleges, where the lure of networking with Harvard's elites drew in users. Popularity on college campuses helped make Facebook's rate of adoption high. It soon became the biggest social network, making it the go-to choice for most users. Facebook had over 2.91 billion monthly active users (MAU) as of September 30, 2021. While the pricing of new technology can be a factor in the rate of adoption, the features offered with innovation can influence the overall demand for the product or service. For example, smartphones, particularly the iPhone, were initially priced as luxury items. That made them exclusive items, with the cost factor as a potential hindrance to the adoption rate. The features and appeal of the iPhone nonetheless created demand among the public, which led to an accelerated rate of adoption for smartphones as a whole. As demand continued to grow and prices went down, smartphones spread rapidly among the public. Not every innovation enjoys high rates of adoption. The complexities and limits of new technology can diminish demand and appeal with the target audience. For instance, virtual reality (VR) technology was offered to the public through a variety of formats and platforms between the 1990s and 2020. Despite improvements to the technology and more ways to access it, the rate of adoption remained relatively low as of 2021. The advent of the so-called \"metaverse,\" however, may renew interest in VR. A slow rate of adoption occurred with 3D television, which had promised to bring the cinematic visuals of 3D movies to the residential market. The constraints of 3D technology and its limitations in content for the home audience led to dwindling demand and minimal adoption rates by the public. Eventually, major manufacturers discontinued 3D television production as the rate of adoption never rose to anticipated levels.

Digital Transaction Management (DTM) is a cloud computing service that allows users to digitally manage document-based transactions. DTM services aim to speed up the signing of business agreements and contracts by digitizing the process in a way that is fast, accurate and secure. In addition to faster execution, other benefits to DTM technology include fewer mistakes and lower operating costs, as documents can be signed and transmitted instantly online rather than printed, physically signed, scanned and emailed, or returned by post. Providers of DTM services include DocuSign (DOCU), Adobe (ADBE) and OneSpan (OSPN).\ufeff\ufeff \ufeff\ufeff \ufeff\ufeff DTM technology creates digital signatures that are highly secure and authenticated which, according to DocuSign, makes them more legally enforceable than traditional signatures.\ufeff\ufeff Furthermore, because DTM services are cloud based, the technology allows businesses to access key documents and do business anytime, anywhere, on any device. Proponents say businesses can more easily adopt DTM if they switch existing paper workflows to a completely digital process from start to finish. They also argue that paper-based processes, while more familiar and comfortable for many users, are not as safe or reliable as many think. Paper documents can be lost, aren't as secure and can be difficult to control. A business choosing to implement DTM can start in a single department or make the switch company-wide. DTM benefits organizations by reducing transaction times and improving the customer experience. The xDTM Standard sets requirements for DTM providers, which must address security, assurance, privacy, validity, availability, scalability, universality and interoperability.\ufeff\ufeff DTM requires industry experts to create and implement best practices for practitioners in different fields, from doctors to lawyers to government workers. For example, when DTM is used in a healthcare setting, the privacy standard might be paramount, whereas in finance the security standard might be more important.\u00a0Every aspect of a business can reap the benefits of DTM. DocuSign, Adobe and OneSpan (formerly VASCO Data Security International) are three major players in the DTM market and specialize in digital signatures. Other major DTM companies include Box (BOX), which provides cloud storage, team collaboration, and workflow automation for businesses; Fluix, which stores files, facilitates document collaboration, and converts paper documents to digital files, in addition to offering e-signatures; and Mi-Corporation, which provides mobile-based solutions to help employees collect data, GPS, photos, barcodes and signatures in the field. There are a number of other DTM companies, so potential users should perform a comparison of costs and features, which change frequently. Some companies cater to small businesses while others focus on enterprise-level solutions. DocuSign. \"The Global Standard for Digital Transaction Management.\" Accessed Dec. 6, 2020.

Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. andresr / Getty Images A split payment involves using multiple payment sources to settle the whole cost of a single transaction. A person using two different credit cards to pay for an item or a table of restaurant guests splitting the bill three ways are both common examples of split payments. Technologically advanced products are rapidly shifting the commercial landscape from a physical one to a digital engagement sphere. In the financial industry, traditional services and products that could only be obtained in a physical location and by conversing with a human financial professional can now be acquired online, thereby foregoing costs of transportation and minimizing valuable time expended meeting with a human. Fintech, financial technology, has disrupted the norm of storing and transferring value, making paying for services and goods possible for everyone in real-time and at a minimal cost. Innovative mechanisms, such as digital split payments, are being implemented for consumers that have a need to split payments across multiple forms. Split payments are already used in traditional brick-and-mortar facilities. A consumer can go to a store and purchase groceries worth $100, paying with either cash, credit cards, debit cards, or a mixture of all three to conclude the transaction. With a digital transaction, the payment technique is a little bit trickier. Although e-commerce platforms accept a growing array of payment forms, including gift cards and closed-loop reward cards, very few accept split payments involving multiple credit or debit cards. One of the few is Crate and Barrel\u2019s online retail site, which specializes in furniture and home accessories. The online site\u2019s checkout page includes three ways the customer can pay for a basket of goods: a gift card, redeem rewards, or a credit/debit card. The latter option also has an optional feature to pay with two credit cards. Most online retailers don\u2019t have the option to pay for an order with multiple cards but are finding new ways to split payments. For example, to make a split payment on an order of $100 from Amazon, a customer with a $60 spending limit on a credit card can purchase a $40 Amazon Gift Card using a debit card. At checkout, the customer\u00a0can then proceed to use both their credit card and gift card for the purchase amount of $60 and $40, respectively, to finalize the transaction. Another use of split payments is to split a payment across multiple cards owned by different parties. This feature can normally be seen in a restaurant setting or a ride-share service program. For example, split payment apps enable a group of people dining at a restaurant to receive one bill through the app. Each member of the group can then pay their portion of the bill with their individual credit cards using the app installed on their mobile devices. Another company that implements split payment is the ride-sharing company, Lyft. Two Lyft users on the same ride can split the bill using the Lyft app on their mobile devices, as long as the ride is still active and they haven\u2019t been dropped off at their final destination. Popular financial and payments app Venmo also allows individuals to easily calculate and split bills for restaurants or other shared purchases. Split payment is a convenient mechanism to share costs and for customers that don\u2019t want to go above their credit card limit, or who have a daily spending limit on their debit cards. If one order has a dollar amount that is greater than each of the imposed limits on both cards, the ability to split the payments would mean that the customer can acquire the goods without going over the limits."

            "content": "CHIPS UID stands for Clearing House Interbank Payments System Universal Identifier. This is just a fancy name for an electronic clearinghouse database system, which facilitates the transfer of funds from both individual consumers and institutions. It is the back end of the automated clearing house (ACH) network, which is run by the National Automated Clearing House Association. It provides the platform that allows exchanges to take place quickly and accurately. Developed in the 1970s, the key to the CHIPS UID system is that its database contains all the necessary information to identify specific participants, such as name, address, routing number, account number, etc. However, all of this information is kept confidential within the system, and each participant's information is linked to a six-digit code, which is referred to as the CHIPS UID. Because the CHIPS UID number can be used by the clearing system to look up the needed banking information of a payment's recipient (e.g. routing number and account number), payment orders can be entered into the system simply with the CHIPS UID number. This simplicity reduces the occurrence of errors in transaction entry and speeds up the process for all parties. Also, because the CHIPS UID number is linked to (but does not reveal) banking information such as an account number, the structure of this clearing system prevents a biller from knowing a payer's banking information.\u00a0This increases the security and confidentiality of the system. The CHIPS UID system processes both domestic and international transactions, and has long been the foremost method of moving U.S. dollars among the world's banks."

Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. Aggregation in the futures markets is a process that combines of all futures positions owned or controlled by a single trader or group of traders into one aggregate position. Aggregation in a financial planning sense, however, is a time-saving accounting method that consolidates an individual\u2019s financial data from various institutions. Aggregation is increasingly popular with advisors when servicing clients\u2019 accounts, as they are able to discuss the accounts with the client in a cleaner, more easily understood way before they break down the account into its respective categories. Financial advisors\u00a0use account-aggregation technology to gather position and transaction information from investors\u2019 retail accounts held at other financial institutions. Aggregators provide investors and their advisors with a centralized view of the investor\u2019s complete financial situation, including daily updates. Financial planners handle both managed and non-managed accounts. Managed accounts contain assets under the advisor\u2019s control that are held by the advisor\u2019s custodian. The planners utilize portfolio management and reporting software to capture a client\u2019s data through a direct link from the custodian. It is important for the planner to have all the accounts because aggregating them without the complete collection would paint an inaccurate picture of that client's finances. Additionally, non-managed accounts contain assets that are not under the advisor's management but are nevertheless important to the client\u2019s financial plan. Examples include 401(k) accounts, personal checking or savings accounts, pensions, and credit card accounts. The advisor\u2019s concern with managed accounts is lack of accessibility when the client does not provide log-in information. Advisors cannot offer an all-encompassing approach to financial planning and asset management without daily updates on non-managed accounts. Account aggregation services solve the issue by providing a convenient method for obtaining current position and transaction information about accounts held at most\u00a0retail banks or brokerages. Because investors\u2019 privacy is protected, disclosing their personal-access information for each non-managed account is unnecessary. Financial planners use aggregate account software for analyzing a client\u2019s total assets, liabilities, and net worth; income and expenses; and trends in assets, liability, net worth, and transaction values. The advisor also assesses various risks in a client\u2019s portfolio before making investment decisions. Many aggregation services offer direct data connections between brokerage firms and financial institutions, rather than using banks\u2019 consumer-facing websites. Clients give financial institutions their consent by providing personal information for the aggregate services."

            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. The term Electronic Payments Network (EPN) refers to a financial clearinghouse\u00a0that handles a variety of electronic funds transfers for the private sector. It is one of the automated clearinghouses (ACHs) in the United States, along with the Reserve Banks. Funds are transferred using the EPN between accounts at the same or different financial institutions. Examples of transfers under the EPN include deposits for payroll, Social Security benefits, and tax refunds, as well as debit transfers like loan payments and insurance premiums. The automated clearinghouse is a network that facilitates the electronic transfer of money from one account to another by allowing financial institutions to execute bulk transfers electronically\u2014either credit or debit transactions. There are two systems used across the United States\u2014the Federal Reserve Bank and the Electronic Payments Network. Both of these systems process all of the ACH transactions in the country. The network was originally used to process recurring payments but now facilitates one-time debit transfers, such as payments made over the telephone and the internet. Many individuals and businesses prefer ACH payments because they are easy, convenient, and secure. For instance, the EPN is likely a key part of direct payroll deposits made by most employers, saving employees from a trip to the bank to deposit their paychecks. Automatic clearinghouse payments are also ideal for things like recurrent billing, allowing for much faster processing and lower fees compared to checks and credit cards. Here's how the system works: Credit transactions settle in one to two business days while debit transactions settle in one business day. The EPN is owned and operated by The Clearing House Payments Company, a private corporation owned by some of the largest commercial banks.\ufeff\ufeff This makes the EPN a bank consortium of sorts. The network was created in 1981 when the Clearing House Payments Company pioneered\u00a0the use of an evening processing cycle to permit overnight delivery of time-critical corporate ACH debits. This system made funds available much sooner than ever before, replacing the use of the older depository transfer checks. The EPN has been responsible for some of the most important ACH innovations\u2014including the creation of the first all-electronic transfer environment. This pivotal invention has increased the efficiency and timeliness of business operations in all corners of the financial marketplace including the facilitation of credit and debit transactions. As mentioned above, credit transactions include things such as payroll, social security, tax refund, and dividend deposits while debit transactions include withdrawals like loan payments, insurance premiums, mortgage payments, and utility bills.

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Micropayments are small transactions or payments usually of less than a dollar\u2014and, in some cases, only a fraction of a cent\u2014that are mainly made online. Micropayments are seen as a way to leverage the internet to facilitate the immediate distribution of digital rights, royalties, in-game purchases, online tipping, and even to coordinate devices connected via the internet of things (IoT). The definition or size of a micropayment differs across payment processors and businesses: some companies recognize all transactions below a dollar as micropayments, whereas others classify micropayments as amounts below $5.00, $10.00, or sometimes $20.00. The latest technology advancements have brought about more exposure and inclusion into the digital world. Fintech, technology in finance, is an emergent sector that is focused on making financial products available to all consumers at a negligible price. These technological efforts are seeing consumers\u2019 costs diminish to as low as a few cents. The problem with such low fees is that they may not feasibly be processable through credit card companies and their traditional transaction fee-based system. Micropayment systems have emerged to meet those needs. The term \"micropayment\" was coined by technology futurist and philosopher Ted Nelson in the 1960s\u00a0as a way to pay for individual copyrights on online content. Nelson envisioned micropayments\u00a0in the neighborhood of\u00a0one\u00a0ten-thousandth of a penny. Such payments would allow users to\u00a0pay for online content and allow the creation of\u00a0low-cost networks as opposed to an advertising-based model. While the World Wide Web\u00a0now works on an advertising-based model, Nelson's idea laid the foundation of the now-ubiquitous hypertext transfer. Currently, micropayments are not yet a common way of paying for internet content. Micropayment platforms built for handling small transactions work in a number of ways. One way is for a seller or service provider to have an established account with a third-party micropayment provider who collects, stores, and distributes the payments made. Through a digital wallet managed by the provider, payments are stored until they accumulate to a larger amount, at which point they are then paid out to the recipient. For easier facilitation of payments, it is necessary for consumers to also set-up an account with the same micropayment provider. Let's look at an example. Upwork is a website that matches freelancers with companies that have temporary projects. A company may hire a video editor from Upwork to edit a few of its commercial videos for a rate of $5/hr. If the freelancer completes the project in four\u00a0hours, the company makes payment to Upwork, who collects its fees and stores the remainder in a digital wallet for the freelancer. As the freelancer gets more jobs, Upwork racks up IOUs until the wallet holds a large amount of say, $1,000. At this point, Upwork makes the payment to the freelancer\u2019s account. Another way that micropayment systems work is through the implementation of a prepaid system. A user sets up an account with a micropayment processor and pays an average or large sum of money into the account. If the provider is also used by the e-commerce platform where the user makes small purchases, the user\u2019s account with the provider is easily debited for the dollar amount of the purchase. In effect, the user makes payments through a micropayment processing account. PayPal offers this type of service. A user can open an account with PayPal and deposit say, $150. Later, if this same user spends $7.99 in a digital store such as iTunes, the funds would be debited from the PayPal account and used to pay for the purchase. PayPal defines micropayments as transactions that are less than $10. A micropayment is mostly limited to the realms of digital payment. Making a $0.99 purchase of a music CD with shipping and handling cost of $25.00 may not make sense to an average consumer. But paying $0.99 for the digital content of the same music album could be a more rational transaction for the buyer as no physical delivery is necessary. Even still, many business owners and e-commerce sites have issues finding a credit card processor as the fee for processing transactions may be more than the micropayment. Also, micropayment processors may handle micropayments differently, so companies have to choose the system that works better for them and save them the most in fees."

Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. Financial innovation is the process of creating new financial products, services, or processes. Financial innovation has come via advances in financial instruments, technology, and payment systems. Digital technology has helped to transform the financial services industry, changing how we save, borrow, invest, and pay for goods. While large banks continue to invest in mobile banking, FinTech companies, like Stripe, help small businesses conduct online payments, and investment broker Robinhood seeks to democratize investing and finance. These innovations have increased the number of financial providers available to consumers, borrowers, and businesses. Financial innovation is a general term and can be broken down into specific categories based on updates to various spheres of the financial system. While the following is not an exhaustive list, major financial innovations have come in the raising of equity capital, remittances, and mobile banking. Investment crowdfunding has begun to open up and make the process of raising equity capital more democratic. While investing in early and growth-stage companies used to be reserved for a privileged few (generally institutional investors), new infrastructure and regulations have allowed individual retail investors to invest in projects they are passionate about and/or have other connections to for a small sum. Individuals receive shares of the new company commensurate with the amount they have invested. Two popular platforms for equity crowdfunding are SeedInvest and FundersClub. In addition, micro-lending platforms such as LendingClub and Prosper allow for debt financing similar to crowdfunding. In this asset class, instead of owning part of the company, individuals become creditors and receive regular interest payments until the loan is eventually paid back in full. Also, P2P lending marketplaces enable both people and companies to buy whole or fractional loans. Remittances are another area that financial innovation is transforming. Remittances are funds that expatriates send back to their country of origin via wire, mail, or online transfer. Given the volume of these transfers worldwide, remittances are economically significant for many countries that receive them. In the early 2000s, the World Bank established a database where people could compare the prices of different transfer services. The Gates Foundation subsequently began tracking remittances in 2011. Western Union and Moneygram once monopolized remittances; however, in recent years, startups such as Transferwise and Wave have competed with their lower-cost apps. Given the onset of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Stablecoins, and Blockchain technology, remittances are becoming more affordable. The lower costs are in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the World Bank to reduce the cost of remittances from 7% to 3% by 2030. Finally, mobile banking has made major innovations for retail customers. Today, many banks like T.D. Bank offer comprehensive apps with options to deposit checks, pay for merchandise, transfer money to a friend, or find an ATM instantly. It is still important for customers to establish a secure connection before logging into a mobile banking app in order to avoid their personal information being compromised.

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Distributed Applications (\u0110Apps) are software applications that are stored and executed mostly on cloud computing platforms and that run on multiple systems simultaneously. These distributed systems operate on the same network and communicate with each other in an effort to complete a specific task or command\u2014unlike a traditional app, which utilizes one dedicated system to achieve an assigned task. A \u0110App is designed to allow users of a network to collaborate and share ideas, co-ordinate on tasks, access information, and exchange apps through a server. They are mostly used on client-server networks where the user\u2019s computer accesses information from the server or cloud computing server. The different computer systems that have been distributed across the network are normally tasked with similar or different objectives. For example, in an e-commerce platform, each of the computers may be responsible for specific tasks, such as: Each of these tasks will be carried out by one or more systems on the network, but all systems communicate with each other to ensure that the customer buys and receives the product that is beneficial to them. The popular music-streaming platform Spotify is a decentralized app that utilizes user's storage and computational power to operate efficiently and with low-latency. Companies in the financial sector are constantly seeking new ways to incorporate \u0110Apps into their work processes through the blockchain. One reason for adopting a blockchain system is to improve the transparency of the firm\u2019s operations in order to meet the stringent requirements of financial regulators. Other reasons why a firm in the financial sector may want to integrate \u0110Apps include reducing the number of intermediaries involved in a financial transaction, providing clients with access to cryptocurrencies, and creating access to groups such as peer-to-peer (P2P) lending groups. \u0110Apps might also be utilized to improve verification on historical transactions, simplify AML and KYC processes, improve trade finance and supply-chain finance, and enable open banking. In the cryptoeconomy, the blockchain used by most cryptocurrencies utilizes \u0110Apps to maintain an efficient digital marketplace. Rather than the conventional client-server network adopted by most centralized organizations, blockchains run on a peer-to-peer network where transactional information carried out between two parties is recorded and shared across multiple computers on the network. These computers, referred to as nodes, each act as an administrator in the bitcoin markets and join the network voluntarily for the opportunity to receive bitcoins as a reward. Each node has a duplicate copy of an original transaction, which gets continually reconciled by the network. So whatever entry that node A has on its record for a bitcoin transaction between Jane and John cannot differ from what nodes B, C, D, E, and F have. This means of verifying each transaction by multiple nodes is called distributed ledgers. Since a version of events can be verifiable with different computers, a hacker would need to get into all the systems spread across various geographical locations in order to tweak the transaction and corrupt the recorded data. This feat is impossible, making the bitcoin blockchain transparent and incorruptible. Also, by storing blocks of information across various nodes on a blockchain network, the blockchain cannot be brought to ruins by the failure of one system. When a computer or system fails, the other systems act as backups and keep running regardless of the down system. Once all active nodes have received and verified a transaction as valid, the block (i.e. the transaction) is added to the chain\u2014the general ledger\u2014for public access. The ability of all nodes to keep functioning, even when one or two nodes drop out of the network,\u00a0ensures that users are constantly getting their transactions recorded and confirmed in an uninterrupted and timely manner."

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. A micro-investing platform is an application that allows users to regularly save small sums of money. Micro-investing platforms aim to remove traditional barriers to investing, such as brokerage account minimums, and encourage people to invest even if they have limited incomes and assets. Micro-investing platforms are the digital-age equivalent of saving in a jar all the spare change from your purchases and then taking the full jar of change to the bank. For example, you could sign up for an account with a platform and register your debit card. Each time you make a purchase, the platform rounds up your purchase to the nearest dollar and deposits the difference into an investment account. Robo-advisors, such as Acorns, helped pioneer this concept. You are unlikely to notice the extra $0.50 missing from your account when you pay $3.50 for a cappuccino. But over time, you will notice the growing sum in your brokerage account. If you buy that same coffee 20 times a month (basically, every workday), you will have effortlessly invested $10 by the end of the month or $120 by the end of the year. Of course, a\u00a0better solution would be for you to make your own cappuccinos at home for $0.50 and invest the $3.00 savings per cup and end up with an extra $60 a month and $720 a year to invest, but for individuals who don\u2019t want to change their behavior, micro-investing offers a superior alternative to investing nothing at all. Micro-investing makes investing sums as low as a few pennies possible by eliminating per-transaction fees and investment minimums. Consumers don\u2019t need to save up $100 for one share of a stock or mutual fund, and they don\u2019t need to pay a brokerage fee to purchase that share. Instead, they pay the micro-investing platform a nominal fee, perhaps $1 per month, and it invests their money in fractional shares. Because those fractional shares are in exchange-traded funds (ETF), the consumer\u2019s investment is diversified across many different stocks and/or bonds, helping to protect against market swings in a way that investing in a single stock does not. Even for people who save regularly, micro-investing platforms can improve their situation. Saving $50 a month for 10 years in a savings account with 0% interest rate results in $6,000, which actually has less intrinsic value after 10 years since savings accounts usually pay interest at a lower rate than inflation. Investing $49 a month (after the $1 platform fee) for 10 years with an average annual return of 7%, however, results in $8,580 before taxes and inflation. Automatic investment is not a required feature of a micro-investing platform. The ability to invest very small amounts of money is. To that end, some micro-investing platforms aim to help users to not only get in the habit of saving and investing but also to learn about investing. The platform might teach them how to choose an ETF based on their goals, risk tolerance, interests and beliefs, for example. A notable micro-investing platform is Acorns Inc. which automatically invests a user's spare change through a smartphone app.\ufeff\ufeff Micro-investing platforms must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) and as a broker-dealer.\ufeff\ufeff \ufeff\ufeff Acorns. \"Ways to invest.\" Accessed Sep. 3, 2020.

Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. The Interledger Protocol is a suite of protocols programmed to create a decentralized and universal network for sending money regardless of its type. Interledger lets participants send and receive money in the currency of their choice and automates currency exchanges. Its design allows anyone anywhere to connect to send and receive payments through a network of connecting nodes. It is not a blockchain and doesn't have any tokens, but it can be used to send and receive them. The traditional process for cross-border transfers between banks involves navigating multiple payment protocols used by digital ledgers to process transactions. The protocols communicate using connectors, but the tools and standards used in such systems are fragmented and siloed, which is inefficient and expensive. The Interledger Protocol (ILP) suite was created to make payments faster, easier, and cheaper and to allow users to exchange currencies of all types. Digital fiat currency, cryptocurrencies, or anything else of value that can be digitally transferred can be sent and received using the ILP. The most significant advancement the ILP made was to allow anyone to send value anywhere using a system similar to sending files or email over the Internet\u2014you select an amount to send and a recipient, and the system initiates the transaction. It verifies there is money to send, validates that it is received, and only transfers it if both parties receive the proper hashed information. This system uses packets, similar to the internet protocols, that make information transfer work. This technique reportedly makes it reliable, fast, and secure to send value to anyone, anywhere. The ILP requires applications to be built outside of its protocols. These applications can be no different than a program with an interface you might use to select who you want to send money to and how much you want to send. The ILP network has the following participants/nodes: The Interledger Protocol consists of four layers that work together: The Protocol serves as a way for settlement systems to connect. The Interledger Foundation refers to all settlement systems as ledgers, which include banks, blockchains, automated clearing systems, and more. These ledgers (the settlement systems) must settle payments according to their agreed-upon terms, such as time limits and the amount owed. The ILP doesn't do this for the parties involved in a transaction; the protocol only facilitates the transactions by transferring the amounts and tracking them. The ILP is reportedly able to handle much more traffic than blockchain networks and traditional payment systems\u2014up to 1 million transactions per second. This is due to the way it handles sending transactions. Using a technique similar to transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP), the ILP breaks information into small packets, sending them to a web page that automatically receives payments. The Interledger Protocol is a suite that allows users to send payments to each other using packets of information, similar to the way the internet currently works. The Interledger Protocol is not a blockchain and doesn't have a native token. It also doesn't use tokens but allows people to send payments to each other using any payment method, including XRP. The Interledger Protocol was created by Ripple (the company) and Stefan Thomas when he was Ripple's chief technology officer. The Interledger Protocol is more of an intermediary payment method than a blockchain service or payment protocol. It allows users to route payments through an existing and fast network using protocols similar to those used by the Internet.

            "content": "A dual interface chip card is a credit or debit card with a single embedded chip that allows the card to be used in both contact and contactless transactions. The \u201ccontactless\u201d part means it has an RFID or NFC chip that enables it to obtain the card\u2019s identifying information and make payments through radio-frequency identification (RFID) or near-field communication (NFC) technologies. The \u201ccontact\u201d part means it can be used with physical readers, either via a traditional magnetic stripe or because the chip can be dipped into an EMV reader. Credit and debit cards have traditionally required a user to swipe the card through an electronic terminal. This allows the terminal to read the magnetic strip on the back of the card, which contains identifying information about the account. The dual interface chip card is a type of smart card with an embedded chip that can facilitate both contact and contactless transactions (aka tap-and-pay). Equipped with a hidden antenna, a contactless card allows users to wave their card in front of a reader to pay for an item. The credit card number and user\u2019s name and expiration date are still contained on the face (or increasingly, the back) of the card, and an EMV chip (Europay, MasterCard, and Visa chip) may still be included, to provide added security in transactions. Overall, having a contactless chip and/or an EMV chip, and a magnetic strip allows the cardholder to complete transactions on a wider variety of machines in a highly secure manner. The chip component of the dual interface card is typically embedded in an outer layer of PVC, polycarbonate, or polyester. Contactless\u00a0chip\u00a0cards\u00a0allow identifying information to be easily read by a sensor. Contactless\u00a0terminals are\u00a0commonly used by employees who have identification badges that must be tapped or waved past a sensor in order to gain access to a building or room. Merchants that want to take advantage of dual interface chip cards must upgrade their card terminal so that it can accept both contact and contactless chip cards. Many merchants have upgraded their terminals to allow for contactless payment transactions because they are faster and can help decrease waiting times for stores with high volumes of transactions. Dual interface chip cards provide greater payment processing convenience. They can be used with both contact and contactless payment terminals. Many card issuers are now producing dual interface chip cards for their customers and phasing out ones with older technology. Terminals have added new chip functionality and also begun to allow for both chip transactions and contactless transactions. Generally, dual interface chip cards may also be known as integrated\u00a0circuit cards. Dual interface chip cards are being produced by more issuers as technology advances across the industry. Many issuers have begun to issue these cards, which make the checkout process much faster with merchants, as they can be used with both contact and contactless payment terminals and handheld devices. The size of the smart card market in 2021. It's predicted to grow to $16.9 billion by 2026, according to a report published by MarketsandMarkets. While dual interface chip cards are becoming more popular, their added costs are one reason they were slow to take off. Dual interface cards generally cost approximately twice as much to produce as a chip card. While high volume production helps to keep manufacturing costs down, the added cost was a consideration\u2014at least, until 2020. Last year saw increased demand for contactless connectivity, as World Health Organization (WHO) and governments across the world advocated the use of smart cards to support social distancing recommendations when conducting point of sale purchases."

Oscar Wong / Getty Images Social payments are the use of social media or an app to transfer money to another person or business. The trend was first popularized by PayPal, but the sector now includes other applications like\u00a0Venmo, Google Wallet, Cash App, and Apple Pay. Social payment servicers link directly to the user's bank account or debit/credit card information via a website or an app. The companies draw money from the user when making a payment and deposit money into the account when the user receives money. A user connects with \"friends\" through the service and can select a person and an amount and either pay or charge accordingly. Businesses also capitalize on social payment. Apple Pay allows users to load their card information onto their phone and pay by scanning the phone or Apple Watch at stores and venues. Banks have versions of social payment, like Zelle, allowing a user to send money directly to another bank account. Already popular outside the U.S., the Super-App is being explored by Elon Musk of Tesla and X Corp. (formerly Twitter, Inc.), and other tech companies. These apps integrate messaging, media, shopping, and banking. Social payments are an example of peer-to-peer, or P2P payment and provide users with: Social payment via smartphones allows users to avoid carrying valuable bank access cards like debit or credit cards. As technology advances and the opportunity to exchange money online becomes easier, digital currency brings risks that include: Social payment services must maintain the highest cybersecurity standards. Many people avoid using social payments even though they are generally safe. It's wise to use extra security on a phone if it's connected to a social payment app by installing a phone PIN and logging out of the app when it's not in use. A payment app is a tool to pay for goods and services and send money to vendors, friends, and family. Users may not get the same financial protection they get from FDIC-protected\u00a0banks\u00a0or other financial institutions. However, many apps offer authentication technologies such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), digital certificates, and RSA encryption to protect personal and business information. Many payment apps are free, while others charge fees to receive money quickly. Users may be charged credit card processing fees\u00a0when using some payment apps. A social payment exchanges money between two parties using a social media platform or apps like Venmo, PayPal, or Apple Pay. Encryption protocols for social payment apps keep accounts private and safe. Social payments can be completed between friends or used for transactions in-store or online.

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. A collaborative economy is a marketplace where consumers rely on each other instead of large companies to meet their wants and needs. Collaborative economies\u00a0consist\u00a0of giving, swapping, borrowing, trading, renting, and sharing products and services for a fee, between an individual who has something and an individual who needs something\u2014generally with the help of a\u00a0web-based middleman. A collaborative economy may also be known as a\u00a0\"shared\u00a0economy,\" \"sharing economy,\" or a \"peer-to-peer economy.\" Essential to a collaborative economy is\u00a0a company or group that acts as a middleman to facilitate consumers\u2019 ability to rely on each other. For example, through Uber, individuals with cars can provide rides to other individuals who want an inexpensive alternative to taxi service; through Craigslist, individuals buy used vehicles and rent out extra living spaces to each other; and consumers on Etsy buy jewelry and other handmade items from individual crafters. The model behind many collaborative economy businesses may be best exemplified by that of eBay Inc., which has been linking buyers and sellers on the internet since 1995. As a \"network orchestrator,\"\u00a0eBay creates a peer-to-peer network where participants interact, exchange items or services for money, and create value. Collaborative economy may be a more accurate term for what many refer to as a \"sharing economy,\" because the middlemen that facilitate such economic activity do so for a fee. A 2015\u00a0Harvard Business Review article posited\u00a0that when a market is mediated, it should be considered more of an \"access economy\" than a sharing economy. Companies in the collaborative economy are often disruptive to established businesses (think Uber and the taxi industry or Airbnb and the hotel industry), and many have experienced rapid revenue growth. They rely on the digital space and smartphone apps to connect buyers and sellers. Online reviews and, in some cases, background checks facilitate trust to make these exchanges possible. The collaborative economy encompasses many types of businesses. There are services like Taskrabbit which lets consumers hire individuals to complete tasks ranging from running errands to assembling furniture; Crowdfunding services like Lending Club which connect people who need to borrow money with numerous individuals who collectively fund loans; Room rental services like Airbnb that lets property owners earn extra income by renting out their spare rooms or entire homes to travelers; and peer-to-peer marketplaces such as Poshmark, used for reselling high quality used clothing. Rideshare apps, crowdfunding platforms, room rental services, and peer-to-peer marketplaces are all examples of collaborative economies. Businesses that rely on customers who buy something rather than share it face a significant threat from businesses in the collaborative economy. Research shows that customers will consider sharing instead of buying if it will result in cost savings of at least 25%, if it is more convenient, or if it offers access to brand-name items. Likewise, sharers can be converted to buyers for the same reasons. Ownership-based companies can join forces with borrowing- or sharing-based companies so that both benefit, for example, specialty grocer Whole Foods\u2019s collaboration with Instacart, a grocery delivery service provided by independent contractors who work on their schedules. A big uncertainty surrounding many collaborative economy companies is regulation. Collaborative platforms like Uber and Airbnb have faced well-publicized regulatory battles in numerous cities where their long-established competitors have tried to use fear of consumer harm as a premise, sometimes valid and sometimes overblown, to implement regulations to put these new companies out of business or to make doing business more difficult."

(\"Kakao\") is a South Korean entertainment company that offers a variety of products, including KakaoTalk. KakaoTalk is a mobile messaging app for smartphones. KakaoTalk was launched in 2010 and as of Q2 2023, had 53.5 million monthly active users globally, 48.2 million of which were in Korea. As Kakao does not report financial information solely for KakaoTalk, this article will discuss the financials for Kakao Corp. overall. Kakao released the financials for its second quarter on Aug. 3, 2023. For Q2 2023, the company had total revenues of $1.5 billion. This was a 15% increase from the same period in 2022. The growth came from both of its reporting segments: Platform and Content. Kakao reported a net income of $41.4 million for Q2 2023; a 44% decrease from $74.5 million in the same period last year. The decrease is a result of increases in operating expenses. Kakao has two business segments: Platform and Content. It reports revenues for both segments but only reports consolidated net income. The Platform segment consists of three segments: Talk Biz, Portal Biz, and Platform-Others. Talk Biz includes Advertising and Commerce segments. Advertising consists of its products Bizboard, Talk Channel, and Emoticon. Its Commerce segment consists of its products Gift, Store, Makers, and Kakao Friends Online. Portal Biz consists of its products Daum PC/Mobile, Kakao Story, Style, and Page. Platform-Others consists of its products Mobility, Pay, Enterprise, Blockchain, and Kakao Friends.

In business, this typically refers to an electronic data interchange (EDI),\u00a0a system used to communicate strictly formatted messages that represent documents other than monetary instruments. An interchange should not be confused with the interchange rate, or \"swipe fees,\" which are fees that a merchant is required to pay with every credit card and debit card transaction. An interchange of electronic\u00a0data can be transmitted using certain telecommunications or transported via electronic storage media. Many EDI transactions use the\u00a0extensible markup language (XML)\u00a0format instead of traditional EDI data formats such as X12 or EDIFACT. These transactions are sent via the internet using standard HTTPS protocol. In the coming years, it\u00a0may be interesting to follow how the development of blockchain technology affects traditional EDI applications. While some may think the blockchain\u2014a digitized, decentralized, public data ledger originally used to power cryptocurrencies like bitcoin\u2014may supplant EDI, it could actually boost its capabilities. Consider that transactions through EDI systems typically involve a buyer, a seller, and a third party. EDI systems depend on one-way, point-to-point communication, meaning that a third party is always left out. However, the blockchain's shared ledger would enable participation from all parties involved, making it easier to share information and increase efficiency. Advantages to the electronic data interchange include its cost-effective nature. For example, digitizing data transmission reduces paper waste and all that goes into paper processing. EDI, buffeted by the development of cloud computing\u00a0and machine learning, can dramatically eliminate the risk of human error and redundancies. EDI also enhances transparency in terms of real-time visibility into transactions. This enables companies to make decisions faster and improve their responses to changing market dynamics. EDI can also shorten lead times for product enhancements and new product delivery. In addition, EDI may be able to help companies adhere to environmental, social, and governance (ESG)\u00a0standards and promote corporate social responsibility. Drawbacks to EDI exist and can make certain processes more cumbersome, perhaps necessitating the exploration of different solutions. For one, EDI uses multiple standards, which can often limit how many devices can be connected to the network. Another issue with the XML web-text language that EDI uses is that it does not have strict standardization and\u00a0allows for multiple programmers to contribute to the coding. Too many document formats can lead to cross-compatibility issues that affect performance as well. For some businesses, the cost of EDI can be a barrier to entry. For others, EDI may limit the types of partnerships they can cultivate. An electronic data interchange is meant to essentially replace an intercompany communication of information that might have once been on paper and is now being transmitted digitally. Common examples of this include purchase orders, invoices, shipping status updates, payment information, and any other transactions involving commerce. The different types of EDI transmissions are point-to-point or direct, in which two computers or systems connect over the internet, without an intermediary, and value-added network (VAN), in which the connection is managed by a third-party network, often with a mail boxing function. Interchange rates are fees that merchants have to pay with credit card and debit card transactions. The fees are charged by payment processing companies, such as Visa or Mastercard and are usually a small percentage of the total. The fees are divvied up between the merchants' banks and the company that issues the credit cards. Interchanges allow electronic data to be transmitted from one system or computer to another, replacing a function that previously would have been carried out on paper. An electronic data interchange (EDI) is typically used in the business world to facilitate transactions between two companies. Examples include invoices, shipping updates, and purchase orders.

The result of an eIDV search on an individual\u2019s identity could result in a match, non-match, or partial match. eIDV is used by banks, brokerage firms, financial advisers, and accountants to minimize fraud and comply with know-your-customer laws, privacy laws, anti-money laundering laws and Combating\u00a0the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) laws.\ufeff eIDV is also used by insurance companies, governments, retailers, casinos,\ufeff lawyers, employers, job recruiters, and real estate agents as part of their due diligence processes. Electronic identity verification matches the data provided by an individual, such as name, date of birth, address, and SSN, against various databases to determine if there is a match. While there is a cost associated with verifying an individual\u2019s identity, it can be less expensive in the long run to avoid doing businesses with individuals who are pretending to be someone they aren\u2019t. For example, eIDV can detect potential fraud if a Social Security number provided by a prospective customer comes back as belonging to a deceased individual. eIDV can also be used to identify prospective customers who are on international watchlists as individuals who are politically exposed, on government sanctions lists, or suspected or convicted of financial crimes.\ufeff eIDV can be used not only to verify new customers but also to stay up to date on existing customers. Businesses may need to follow different customer verification procedures depending on their line of business and their country of operation. Businesses pay money for eIDV services based on the number and types of databases searched to verify an individual\u2019s identity. For an eIDV service to be effective, it must rely on the most up-to-date and high-quality database possible. Some databases may be more accurate than others depending on whether they are updated daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly. Further, the success of a search will depend in part on how comprehensive a database is. Even in a best-case scenario, a database may only cover about 80% of a country\u2019s population."

The large value transfer system (LVTS) is an electronic wire payment system in Canada, facilitating the transfer of funds between large financial institutions, including the central Bank of Canada. It is a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) equivalent. Payments are not settled in real time but are settled the same day they are processed, in the evening. This makes the payments practically instantaneous. The large value transfer system (LVTS) processes most payments made in Canada and handles funds in Canadian dollars (CAD). On a typical business day, LVTS clears and settles about 28,000 payments a day worth CAD $153.5 billion. LVTS was launched in 1999 and is operated by Payments Canada. Sixteen Canadian banks, including the Bank of Canada, currently participate in the LVTS. LVTS transactions can be performed for banks or their clients. At the end of each day, all participating banks need to settle up their LVTS transactions. This process may leave some banks with extra funds, while other banks need more funds to cover their transactions. Banks that have extra money are allowed to use the LVTS to loan money to banks that need more funds to cover their transactions. This is an overnight loan that takes place in the overnight market, at the overnight interest rate. The overnight rate is set by the Bank of Canada, which aims to keep the rate within an operating band one-half of a percentage point wide. The target for the overnight rate is in the center of this band. So, if the operating band for the overnight rate 2.5 to 3.0 percent, the target for the overnight rate is 2.75 percent. The bank rate is at the top of the operating band, or, in this example, 3 percent, and this will be the rate that the Bank of Canada will charge on any overnight loans to banks in the LVTS system. The deposit rate is at the bottom of the operating band, or, in this example, 2.5 percent, and this will be the rate the Bank of Canada will pay on any surplus funds held overnight. The target for the overnight rate is comparable to the Federal Reserve\u2019s target for the federal funds rate. These transactions are instant, which improves the quickness and efficiency of business transactions. Once the transaction is sent through the system, it cannot be reversed. This prevents insufficient funds, stop payments and fraud. Because settlements through the LVTS system are guaranteed and irreversible, the system reduces the overall systemic risk for the Canadian economy."

Automated Confirmation Transaction (ACT) Service is an automated data system designed to document and report the clearing of trades on exchanges owned and operated by Nasdaq, which compares trade information entered by ACT participants and submits \"locked-in\" trades to National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) for clearance and settlement; transmits reports of the transactions automatically to the National Trade Reporting System, if required, for dissemination to the public and the industry; and provides participants with monitoring and risk management capabilities to facilitate participation in a \"locked-in\" trading environment.\ufeff\ufeff Designed to increase transparency, the Automated Confirmation Transaction (ACT) Service is a technology platform that provides faster access to trade information, increase the efficiency of trade reconciliation and back-office transactions and provides online access to the status of all trade entries. The FINRA/Nasdaq Trade Reporting Facility\u00ae (TRF) is a regulatory compliance entity operated in partnership by FINRA and Nasdaq for reporting over-the-counter (OTC) transactions in equity securities. ACT is a proven and trusted post-trade technology, and is built on the INET platform, the industry standard for more than 90 marketplaces in 50 countries. For over 20 years, the TRF has been supporting OTC trade reporting in equity securities using ACT. ACTs are used in the Nasdaq electronic stock market.\ufeff\ufeff Prior to using the ACT, the Nasdaq utilized the Trade Acceptance and Reconciliation Service, or TARS. The ACT replaced TARS and assumed its functionality in the third quarter of 1998.\ufeff\ufeff According to the SEC, participation in ACT is mandatory for all brokers that are members of a clearing agency registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 17A of the Securities and Exchange Act, and for all brokers that have a clearing arrangement with such a broker. Participation in ACT as a market maker (MM) is conditioned on the MM's initial and continuing compliance with SEC requirements. Upon execution and receipt by Nasdaq of the ACT Participant application agreement, an ACT Participant may commence input and validation of trade information in ACT eligible securities. ACT Participants may access the service via Nasdaq terminals or Workstations or through computer interface during the hours of operation specified in the ACT Users Guide. Prior to such input, all ACT Participants, including those that have trade report information submitted to Nasdaq by any third party, must obtain from Nasdaq a unique identifying Market Participant Symbol (\"MMID\" or \"MPID\"), and use that identifier for trade reporting and audit trail purposes.

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Banknet is a global payments network operated by Mastercard that facilitates authorization of credit card transactions from almost any point in the world. Banknet is one of the world's largest global telecommunications networks and links all Mastercard members and data processing centers into a single financial network. Banknet launched in 1997. Today, Mastercard runs on of the world\u2019s largest credit and debit card networks. The company holds over 20 percent of the global market share within its industry, with more that 190 million cards in circulation throughout the world. Banknet enables Mastercard's side of an authorization transaction to be performed within seconds. Before Banknet arrived, a payment through Mastercard took approximately 650 milliseconds to process. Banknet has since cut down that time to just 210 milliseconds. The network's hub is located in Mastercard's Global Technology and Operations headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri. According to Mastercard, the network\u2019s hub and data warehouse are considered, \u201cone of the most robust data centers in the world.\u201d The St. Louis facility houses 80 terabytes of data on past transactions. Whenever the system undergoes a change or upgrade, the company tests the new system on 30 million practice transactions before implementing the change. Banknet operates as a virtual private network (VPN) that all of its nodes are linked into. In this way, the network is capable of completing over two million transaction per hour while keeping both parties\u2019 information secure. The network relies on over 1,000 data centers located throughout the world that function as endpoints or nodes in the network. Each of these data centers is furthermore equipped with dual router technology. The redundancy of this technology provides automatic backups of transaction in the event that a shutdown occurs. Banknet\u2019s technology uses asynchronous data transfer for transactions, allowing the network to regulate the use of its bandwidth\u00a0to match demand at any given time. This function allows the system to function optimally when demand is highest. For this communication technology, Banknet primarily partners with AT&T. Unlike Banknet\u2019s peer-to-peer (P2P) network, Visa handles transactions through a centralized, or \u201cstar-based/hub & spoke\u201d system. This type of network connects its many endpoints to only a few main data centers. In this way, Banknet functions more efficiently, with greater flexibility and less risk of failure. If one of Banknet\u2019s data centers fails, there remain many others still online and functional, taking over the functionality of the crippled node. If, however, one of the data centers on Visa\u2019s network fails, a larger portion of its transactions will be adversely affected. This can create bottlenecks for incoming data and difficulty in isolating the point of the failure."

Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications. Data anonymization seeks to protect private or sensitive data by deleting or encrypting personally identifiable information from a database. Data anonymization is done for the purpose of protecting an individual\u2019s or company\u2019s private activities while maintaining the integrity of the data gathered and shared. Data anonymization\u00a0is also known as \"data obfuscation,\" \"data masking,\" or \"data de-identification.\" It can be contrasted with de-anonymization, which are techniques used\u00a0in data mining that attempt to re-identify encrypted or obscured information. Corporations generate, store, and process enormous amounts of sensitive data in the normal course of their business operations. Advancement in technology has thrived because of relevant information found in data that has been generated and shared across various sectors and countries. Financial innovation in technology (fintech) has made boundless progress in the way financial services are customized to clients, thanks to data that has been shared from sectors such as social media and e-commerce establishments. Data shared between digital media and e-commerce firms has helped both sectors better advertise products on their sites to a specific user or consumer. However, in order for shared data to be useful without compromising the identities of clients compiled in the database, anonymization must be utilized. Data anonymization is carried out by most industries that deal with sensitive information such as the healthcare, financial, and digital media industries while promoting the integrity of data sharing. Data anonymization reduces the risk of unintended disclosure when sharing data between countries, industries, and even departments within the same company. It also reduces opportunities for identify theft to occur. For example, a hospital sharing confidential data on its patients to a medical research lab or pharmaceutical company would be able to do so ethically if it keeps its patients anonymous. This can be done by removing the names, Social Security Numbers, dates of birth, and addresses of its patients from the shared list while leaving the important components required for medical research like age, ailments, height, weight, gender, race, etc. Anonymization of data is done in various ways including deletion, encryption, generalization, and a host of others. A company can either delete personally identifiable information (PII) from its data gathered or encrypt this information with a strong passphrase. A business can also decide to generalize the information collected in its database. For example, a table contains the exact gross income earned by five\u00a0CEOs in the retail sector. Let's assume the recorded incomes are $520,000, $230,000, $109,000, $875,000, and $124,000. This information can be generalized into categories like \u201c< $500,000\u201d and \u201c\u2265 $500,000\u201d. Although, the data is obfuscated, it will still be useful to the user. Data anonymization\u00a0is whereby classified information is sanitized and masked in such a way that if a breach occurs, the data acquired is useless to the culprits. The need to protect data should be held in high priority in every organization, as classified information that falls into the wrong hands can be misused, intentionally or unintentionally. Lack of sensitivity when handling sensitive client information can come at a great cost to businesses due to regulatory authorities cracking down on gross negligence. Legal and compliance requirements like PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) impose hefty fines on financial institutions in the event of a credit card breach.\ufeff\ufeff \ufeff\ufeff\u00a0PIPEDA, a Canadian Law, governs the disclosure and use of personal information by corporations.\ufeff\ufeff There are other multiple regulatory bodies that have been formed to monitor an organization\u2019s use or misuse of private data. Decoding anonymized data is possible through a process known as De-anonymization (or \"re-identification\"). Due to the fact that anonymized data can be decoded and unraveled, critics believe anonymization provides a false sense of security.

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Mass payment is a method of paying multiple recipients online simultaneously. Instead of typing in each recipient's payment information separately, users can upload a spreadsheet containing all the relevant data or use a mass payments application programming interface. Mass payments can be set up as one-time transactions or, if the payment amount is always the same, as recurring automatic payments. Mass payments may also be referred to as \"mass payouts.\" Mass payments are a faster, easier and potentially more cost effective solution to sending out checks (though there is a fee to use a mass payment service), and recipients appreciate receiving their money faster and more securely, which helps protect and boost the payer's reputation. Instead of waiting to receive a check in the mail, recipients receive a link via email or mobile phone to claim their payment through a secure online account. They can then transfer the money to their bank account, receive it on a payment card, collect it at a cash pickup location, or use it to make online purchases, depending on what options the mass payments provider offers. Mass payment services are typically available from money transfer companies such as PayPal. Payment logs allow senders of mass payments to keep track of their complete payment history, and senders can easily export payment data to spreadsheet or accounting applications. Payments may be sent to recipients in different countries and in different currencies, too. In this way, mass payments allow businesses to reap the potential benefits of expanding the scope of their customers and vendors worldwide without creating a drag on accounts payable. Situations where mass payments can be a huge time saver include paying affiliate commissions, customer rebates, survey incentives, and employee benefits, especially when these payments are sent out frequently. Batch processing is a common form of mass payment. It is the processing of\u00a0transactions\u00a0in a group or batch. No user interaction is required once batch processing is underway. This differentiates batch processing from transaction processing, which involves processing transactions one at a time and requires user interaction. While batch processing can be carried out at any time, it is particularly suited to end-of-cycle processing, such as for processing a bank's reports at the end of a day or generating monthly or biweekly\u00a0payrolls. Mass payments shift the payment model from sender directed to receiver directed. Instead of the sender of the payment offering limited payment options, the recipient can choose how to get paid and exercise greater control over the payment process. Furthermore, the organizations sending the payment can save money, especially when it comes to making international payments, which traditionally incur significant wire transfer and foreign exchange fees plus the fees for paperwork associated with doing business with many financial institutions in many countries. Mass payments can also save senders time as recipients can provide their personal information to the mass payments vendor rather than to the sender. The freed up resources like time and money can be redirected to core business activities or freed up to keep costs down. Senders should make sure their mass payment vendor employs strong security practices to protect their platform against data breaches and other security threats."

Financial portals are websites or apps that provide a variety of financial data and information all in one place. They act as information hubs for users or clients, who are often individual investors and provide up-to-date financial news and data to make their investment decisions. Financial portals are often cloud-based platforms that are customizable for both the financial institution and the investor client. Most online brokerages now offer their customers financial portals in addition to trading services, but non-brokers also provide portals either for free or by subscription. Investors need the latest information in order to stay current with the markets and make educated trades. Although there are many sites to choose from when deciding where to get your news, some make more sense than others depending on the information you need. Financial portals are intended to give clients all of the finance-related information they need in one place. Often the portals will provide visitors with quotes, research, articles, analyst recommendations\u00a0and so on.

            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. The corporate trade payment (CTP) was a form of transferring funds electronically that is no longer in use today. The CTP system was utilized by corporate and governmental entities to pay creditors using the automated clearing house (ACH) system. The CTP payment network became obsolete\u00a0due to its lack of flexibility and since been replaced by more modern systems. The corporate trade payment (CTP) system was introduced in 1983 to address the limitations of the automated clearing house (ACH) system, which had been in place since 1974. The ACH system used a 94-character format to encode payment data in electronic form. Data encoded in this format typically included the institutions and account numbers of both payor and payee, as well as the relevant dates, payment amounts and processing codes. The ACH system left 30 to 34 of the 94 available characters for messages, which was found to be insufficient. Further problems with the ACH system included the lack of standardized rules or procedures for passing any included messages on to the recipient of the transaction. Neither were there any standardized procedures for encoding message data or processing it. When the CTP system was introduced, it expanded the message attachment capability of an electronic payment to up to 4,999 additional 94-character messages. In theory, this allowed the payor to include with their payment information any necessary payment advice, or information that served to identify the reason for a payment and explain the amount of the payment. Benefits of the CTP system for both payor and payee included the elimination of postage and handling costs and the reduction of bank fees. However, the costs of the CTP system meant that it was not ideal for sending or receiving simple, single-invoice payments, but was better suited to more complex remittances. The CTP system was phased out with the passage of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996. The corporate trade exchange (CTX) system replaced the CTP system, with features that sought to rectify its predecessor's flaws. The CTP system failed in part because of the requirements of its format, which made it difficult to package payment advice information into the addenda records. The CTP system also lacked a data content standard that would have made it easier for corporations to automate accounts receivable information. The CTX system provides for easier tracking of payments, and allows for the addition of more extensive and adequate payment advice records with each payment. The CTX system also corrects the problem of a data content standard that plagued the CTP, using X12 to automate the receipt of payments.

            "content": "The Dave mobile app wants to be your financial pal Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications. Los Angeles-based Dave.com was built on the premise that financial products should be easy and approachable, and that bank overdraft fees are the worst thing that was ever invented. Now Dave has launched its own bank, and they won\u2019t charge overdraft fees. And you can use the app to get a quick advance on your paycheck, avoiding the deep gouges inflicted by payday lenders. Dave\u2019s first iteration, launched in 2017, was as a mobile app that helped users avoid overdraft fees by looking over past banking activity to predict future cash flows. Users link bank accounts, let Dave know when to expect payday deposits, and tag rent and other regular payments.\u00a0Just because your bank balance says $750 today doesn\u2019t mean you have $750 to spend tomorrow. Your rent might be due today, so when you put that cup of coffee on your debit card in the morning, you\u2019ll find that it cost you upwards of $30, once your bank has whacked your account for an overdraft fee. Paying a huge fee for a $5 cup of coffee is not an effective financial management technique. So the app was set up to alert its users about problems that might arise before the next paycheck is deposited.\u00a0Jason Wilk, co-founder and CEO, says, \u201cWe wanted to build a product that was your financial friend. We felt banks were kicking people when they were down.\u201d Wilk also says that the name Dave, besides being a friendly sound, represents David in his battle against Goliath in the Old Testament.\u00a0\u201cWe help our clients take on big banks and huge fees,\u201d Wilk states. In 2019, Dave launched its own bank, so its users can avoid Goliath entirely. Customers that have their paychecks directly deposited to Dave\u2019s bank, or the bank attached to their Dave app account, will be alerted when the cash flow projections indicate the balance might drop below zero, and opt for a $100 advance to bridge the gap. The loan is automatically repaid on the user\u2019s next payday.\ufeff\ufeff Banking clients also get a debit card, and the option to have Dave report regular on-time real estate rent payments to the various credit bureaus to help lift their credit scores. Credit bureaus recently started accepting rent payments as a way to raise scores, so they\u2019re filing those reports for customers who opt into the service, for free.\u00a0Rent payment history reporting requires that client directly deposit their paychecks. There are services that report your rent to credit bureaus for you, but they're not free. Either you or your landlord (or both) will have to pay for the privilege. You can also use the app to find side gigs through partnerships Dave has established to find local short-term jobs. Partners include Airbnb, Instacart, DoorDash, and Rover. Using the app costs $1 per month, which is deducted from your bank account when your first monthly paycheck hits.\u00a0You can earn free credits towards your Dave subscription fee by making debit card purchases from partnering retailers; they are detailed in the app.\u00a0This feature works best when location services are turned on. If you get an advance, the cost is up to you. Borrowers choose how much they want to tip Dave after getting the advance.\ufeff\ufeff As Wilk says, \u201cYou\u2019re avoiding what might be a $38 fee. What is this advance worth to you?\u201d Besides funding Dave\u2019s ability to provide advances in the future, Dave plants a tree in Africa based on the percentage of tips received. Sound too good to be true? There are a few small problems that could spoil your fun. Dave can only connect to bank accounts with sole owners, and only one mobile device is allowed per Dave account. It\u2019s an app-only service; you can\u2019t check on your account on the web. If you regularly deplete your checking account within a couple of days after you get paid, you won\u2019t be eligible for advances. Dave looks for a bit of a cushion before making you a candidate for an advance. Also, it can take up to 3 days for an advance to show up in your checking account; you can pay a fee to get the advance in just 8 hours. If you don\u2019t pay your advance back on the due date, you\u2019re ineligible for future advances. And users who connect the same Dave account to multiple devices are dropped from the service.\u00a0So play by the rules, and be as friendly to Dave as Dave is to you. There are prescribed steps to follow should you want to cancel your Dave app subscription that are trickier than merely deleting the app from your device, so be sure to follow them if you want to unfriend Dave.\ufeff\ufeff Business Wire. \"Banking for Humans: Dave Raises $110 Million, Launches Credit-Building Banking to 3.5 Million Users.\" Dave.com. \"Side Hustle by Dave.\" Dave.com. \"Why Am I Paying Back More Than I Borrowed?\" Dave.com. \"How to Cancel My Dave Membership.\""

            "content": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia. A Mastercard acquirer is a merchant bank or other financial institution that accepts and processes transactions made with a Mastercard. Mastercard partners with institutions all over the world to offer Mastercard-branded payment cards. Mastercard payment cards exclusively use its network for processing all transactions. Payment cards may be credit, debit, or\u00a0prepaid cards. A Mastercard acquirer is a merchant bank or financial institution licensed to work with merchants, process and settle transactions, and resolve issues involving transactions. Acquirers work with issuers to ensure that a payment card transaction is authorized. When a cardholder swipes a Mastercard for payment, this initiates a series of steps to authorize the transaction. A request is made to the Mastercard acquirer, which in turn places a request to the card issuer\u2014not Mastercard\u2014to authorize the transaction. If the cardholder's account holds sufficient funds, the card issuer sends an authorization code to the acquirer, who then authorizes the transaction to be made by the merchant. Payment card industry (PCI) compliance is an important priority for Mastercard and its acquirers. Mastercard offers a training program for acquirers, called the PCI 360 Education Program. This program helps acquirers engage with merchants to strengthen and expand the enforcement of PCI Security Standards. Mastercard acquirers provide a number of services that allow a merchant to accept Mastercard payments. The acquirer is ultimately responsible for building a PCI compliant system for managing card and financial information, which involves ensuring that transactions and card information are secure. Because the acquirer works with merchants accepting Mastercard transactions, they should ensure merchants understand how to keep transactions secure and PCI compliant. Mastercard acquirers also work with merchants to ensure they have chosen the correct merchant level, which is based on transaction volume from the most recent 52-week period. The merchant level may change over time according to the needs of the business. The amount a merchant receives from a credit card payment is less than the amount charged. This is because both the card issuer and Mastercard acquirer subtract service fees. The fee subtracted by the issuer is called the interchange rate, and the fee subtracted by the acquirer is called the discount rate. Mastercard also imposes an acquirer license fee that businesses must pay as part of the expense involved with credit card processing. These fees are usually calculated as a percentage of the sale plus a fixed fee. For example, 1.80% + $0.10. This ensures the issuer and acquirer receive the optimal payment amount, even if the original transaction was for a high or low dollar amount. Mastercard interchange rates are usually updated semiannually and published on its website. This is just one example of the variety of fees that a business pays when they accept Mastercard, or any other credit card, as payment for products or services sold.

            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. Liberty Reserve was formerly a company based in Costa Rica that allowed people to send and receive secure payments without revealing their account numbers or real identities. Liberty Reserves (LRs) were the company's electronic currency, which could be converted back and forth between U.S. dollars or Euros. Headed by Arthur Budovsky, who renounced his American citizenship to create a new life in Costa Rica, the company operated from 2006-2013 until authorities cracked down on it when they discovered that it was a massive multi-billion dollar money laundering business. Customers used Liberty Reserve's online exchange service to process payment transactions and add or withdraw funds from their accounts. An account could be set up simply with a name and birth date, both of which did not have to be verified, and an email address. With little or no oversight of international financial transactions in Costa Rica, Liberty Reserve was free to build a money exchange business where legitimate, albeit unregulated, transactions could take place, but also where illegal money laundering could easily escape the eyes of the law. Each transaction fee was 1% of the processed amount or $2.99, whichever was less. At its peak, Liberty Reserve served more than one million customers worldwide, including 200,000 in the U.S. and processed around 12 million transactions a year, which enriched Budovsky and his associates. The Patriot Act enabled U.S. authorities to go after Liberty Reserve because the company handled USD overseas. Part of the mandate of the Patriot Act was to make sure terrorists were unable to use USD to finance their activities. In 2013 the U.S. seized and shut down Liberty Reserve, and a year later Budovsky and several other former Liberty Reserve workers were arrested in Spain and extradited to the U.S. to face charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering. At first, Budovsky pleaded not guilty to the charges, but then several months later changed his plea to guilty in a deal with prosecutors. Some of the former workers of the company received relatively light penalties and sentences. The mastermind, Budovsky, on the other hand, was sentenced in 2016 to 20 years of incarceration."
