            "content": "College students and their parents may qualify for low-cost federal loans Investopedia / Candra Huff Every college-bound person and/or their parents need to know how the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) process works. Some may dismiss the idea of applying for financial aid for college because they think they make too much money to qualify. But regardless of their family earnings, they may be eligible for some form of financial assistance, including federal, state, and school-based aid as well as merit-based scholarships. In fact, it makes sense for almost all families with a college-bound child to fill out the FAFSA. The primary purpose of the FAFSA is to determine how much financial aid a student qualifies for, including both need-based and non-need-based aid. It determines eligibility for federal need-based grants, including: To determine a family's financial need, the FAFSA asks a series of questions about the parents' and student's income and assets as well as other factors, such as how many children there are in the family. It then comes up with a Student Aid Index (SAI). The Expected Family Contribution (EFC) was renamed the Student Aid Index (SAI) for the 2024\u20132025 school year forward to clarify its meaning. It does not indicate how much the student must pay the college. It is used by the school to calculate how much student aid the applicant is eligible to receive. The FAFSA is the official form that students or their families use to apply for financial assistance for college from the federal government. States, individual colleges and universities, and private scholarship programs rely on the information provided in the application as well. In terms of assets, the FAFSA assumes that 20% of a student\u2019s assets and 5.64% of the parents\u2019 assets should be available for spending in any one college year. Those assets include bank accounts and investments but exclude the value of retirement accounts, life insurance policies, and annuities. Any equity in the family home is also excluded. The information you supply on the FAFSA determines whether you qualify for need-based aid, non-need-based aid, or some combination of the two. If you aren't ready to fill out the FAFSA itself, you can get an estimate of your SAI and likelihood of receiving financial aid by using the office of the Department of Education's Federal Student Aid Estimator. Here are some of the programs that require filling out the FAFSA. Grants are the most attractive type of financial aid because they do not need to be repaid. Pell Grants, the main federal grants for college, are intended for students who demonstrate exceptional financial need. They are primarily awarded to undergraduates, but some teacher certification programs are also eligible. The maximum award is $7,395 for the 2024\u201325\u00a0award year\u00a0(July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025). A college or university's financial aid office determines how much money students qualify to receive, based on their family's SAI and the school's cost of attendance (COA). These grants also do not need to be repaid, but they are only available at certain schools. The amounts range between $100 and $4,000 per year. As with Pell Grants, these supplemental grants are meant for students with few other financial resources. These loans are subsidized by the government, which means they will not be required to pay interest on them while you are in school and for a grace period of six months after you graduate. Loan amounts that can be subsidized range from $3,500 to $5,500 per year, depending on your year in school and whether you are considered a dependent or independent student as defined by the office of Federal Student Aid. These subsidized loans are not available for graduate study. The federal work-study program makes paid part-time jobs available through participating colleges and universities. Both undergraduate and graduate students may be eligible. Federal loans, whether subsidized or unsubsidized, tend to be less costly than private student loans and have more flexible repayment options. Unsubsidized loans are similar to their subsidized counterparts with one big exception: The government doesn\u2019t pay the loan interest while the student is in school or during a six-month grace period afterward. If students or their parents don't pay the interest during this time period, it will be added to the principal of the loan. Schools can offer these loans as part of a financial aid package regardless of a family's financial situation. Dependent students are eligible for a maximum of $31,000 in subsidized and unsubsidized loans over their undergraduate years unless their parents are ineligible for federal PLUS loans, in which case the limit may be higher. These loans are intended for parents or graduate students. They aren't subsidized by the government, so the interest that accrues during the college years will be added to the principal if it isn\u2019t paid\u00a0while the student is in school. Students who are training to become teachers can qualify for these grants\u2014up to $4,000 per year\u2014even if they don\u2019t meet need-based criteria. To qualify, the student must take certain classes and, within eight years of\u00a0graduation, have worked for at least four years in an elementary or secondary school or educational service agency that serves low-income families. These grants don't have to be repaid unless the student fails to fulfill the requirements, in which case the grant is converted into a direct unsubsidized loan. Fortunately for most prospective students, the actual process of applying for financial aid is relatively straightforward. For added peace of mind, you can refer to the step-by-step guide below to make certain that you're staying on top of your financial aid during your (or your child's) academic career: The U.S. Department of Education uses the FAFSA to determine a student's eligibility for need-based federal\u00a0financial aid\u00a0for college based on their financial situation. Federal financial aid may include federal grants, scholarships, work-study, and/or loans. The\u00a0FAFSA is not a\u00a0loan or free money. It is simply an application that you fill out in order to determine your eligibility for receiving a federal\u00a0loan, grant, or work-study. There are three main types of financial aid that a student may be deemed eligible for after completing the FAFSA. Some of this money is free money, some must be earned through work, and some must be repaid. The most general eligibility requirements to qualify for the various forms of federal student aid include that you have financial need, are a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen, and are enrolled in an eligible degree or certificate program at a college or career school. However, there are more eligibility requirements you must meet to qualify for federal student aid and these requirements are specific, based on the type of aid. The majority of students are eligible to receive some type of financial aid from the federal government to help pay for college or career school. The student's age, race, and field of study\u00a0are not taken into account when determining their eligibility. Most families\u2014regardless of how much they earn or have accumulated in assets\u2014will find it useful to fill out the FAFSA for loans, scholarships, and grants. If it turns out that they are ineligible for free money in the form of grants or scholarships, they are still likely to be eligible for non-need-based aid in the form of direct unsubsidized loans from the federal government. Federal student loans typically have more favorable terms than loans from private lenders and offer a variety of flexible repayment options.

            "title": "Student Loan Interest Rates",
            "content": "Current student loan interest rates and ranges for 2024 damircudic / Getty Images The interest rate on a federal undergraduate student loan for the 2023\u20132024 academic year is 6.53%, up from 4.99% in the previous academic year and the highest level reached since 2008. If you're looking to take out a new private student loan, your rate for a\u00a0 fixed-interest loan will range between 3.49% and 17.99%, according to lending marketplace Credible. Before taking out student loans, there are important things to consider, particularly in this volatile economic climate. In June 2023, the Supreme Court blocked a plan by the Biden administration to grant broad debt forgiveness to student loan borrowers. Two months later, the White House responded by unveiling the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, which also has been blocked pending the outcome of court challenges. Private lenders set a range for interest rates. Your actual rate will be based on the creditworthiness of you and your co-signer. In the table below, you can see the current rates from the loan marketplace Credible. Annual percentage rates (APRs) on Credible start at 3.49% for a fixed-rate private student loan as of August 2024.\u00a0These rates reflect the rates offered by a variety of lenders on the marketplace. Individual lenders will each have their own range, which may be a bit narrower. Federal student loans don't take into account credit scores and income. However, these factors play a big role in private lenders\u2019 decisions. Students who don\u2019t meet lenders\u2019 credit requirements will need a co-signer. About 90% of private student loans are made with a co-signer. However, even if you don\u2019t have a good credit score or a co-signer, there are lenders that offer student loans for bad credit and student loans without a co-signer. Try to take out no more in student loans than what you expect to make in your first year out of school. Between July 1, 2023, and June 30, 2024, federal student loan rates for new undergraduate loans are 5.50%. New graduate loan rates are 7.05% and new parent PLUS loan interest rates are 8.05% during that same time period. These rates change annually. There is an origination fee of 1.057% for federal direct subsidized loans and direct unsubsidized loans. The origination fee is higher at 4.228% for parent PLUS loans. This fee isn\u2019t added to your repayment. Instead, it\u2019s deducted from your initial loan disbursement. In response to the pandemic, the federal government paused student loan payments and set interest rates set to 0%. This relief came to an end in 2023. Interest resumed on September 1, 2023, and the first student loan payments were due in October. Fewer people are enrolling in post-secondary education. In the fall of 2020, colleges and universities re-opened their classrooms and dorm rooms after going remote due to the pandemic. But within weeks, many schools had to once again postpone sports and other activities as widespread quarantines forced them to switch from in-person classes back to virtual ones. As the pandemic dragged on, many thought that community colleges would see higher enrollment, but data showed that fall enrollment was up for some large public universities, while enrollment at community colleges was down as much as 30% at some institutions. By the spring of 2022, enrollment continued to exhibit worsening trends, with total post-secondary enrollment falling to around 16.2 million, a one-year decline of 4.1%. This followed a 3.5% drop the year prior. The bulk of the drop was in undergraduate enrollment, down 4.7% from the previous year. The number of individuals enrolled in undergraduate programs was down 9.4% from before the pandemic. Enrollment began to stabilize in fall 2022, but combined undergraduate and graduate enrollment was still 5.8% lower than in 2019. By the spring of 2023, enrollment dipped another 0.5%. Following the 2007\u20132008 Great Recession, state higher education funding fell a full 25%. The share of higher education revenues paid by students rose from 36% in 2008 to 47% in 2012. This led to student loan debt that has surpassed $1.6 trillion. The debt may get worse if the education system is forced to undergo more budget cuts and as enrollments struggle to recover from the pandemic. While student debt is an ongoing issue, some borrowers may be able to get relief through student loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers working toward forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program and on an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan may get their remaining balance forgiven after 120 qualifying payments are made. The Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan would set monthly payments for undergraduate student loan borrowers at 5% of discretionary income, unpaid interest would not be capitalized, and those with balances under $12,000 could receive loan forgiveness after 10 years of payments. However, on July 18, 2024, a federal appeals court blocked the SAVE plan until two court cases centered around the IDR plan can be resolved. The Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into an interest-free forbearance while the litigation is ongoing. It has also outlined options for borrowers who were nearing PSLF\u2014borrowers can either \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if they reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan. The interest on student loans can be calculated as either compound or simple interest, depending on the lender. Federal student loans and most private student loans use a simple interest formula to calculate student loan interest. This formula consists of multiplying your outstanding principal balance by the interest rate factor and multiplying that result by the number of days since you made your last payment. The interest rate factor is used to calculate the amount of interest that accrues on your loan. It is determined by dividing your loan\u2019s interest rate by the number of days in the year. Federal student loan interest rates are determined by the 10-year Treasury note auction every May, plus a fixed increase with a cap. Private student loan interest rates are determined by each lender based on market factors and the borrower\u2019s and co-signer\u2019s creditworthiness. Most private lenders also offer a variable interest rate, which typically fluctuates monthly or quarterly with overnight lending rates such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). Federal student loan rates for the year between July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025, are: Federal student loan rates are relatively low when compared to historic levels. If you need student loans to pay for a college education, learn what the interest rates are and how they work before applying. Always exhaust all your options for federal student loans first by using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), then research the best private student loans to fill in any gaps. Whether you choose federal or private loans, only take out what you need and can afford to repay. If you have student loans and need help paying them, you may want to consider a refinance\u2014but know that this could cause you to lose any protections you receive from having federal loans. If refinancing is right for you, review all of the best student loan refinance companies, which offer competitive rates and can cater to unique debt situations.

            "content": "Here are the pros and cons of two types of student loans Federal student loans are provided by the government. There are two kinds: subsidized and unsubsidized loans. On the other hand, the best student loans offered by private lenders are usually from specific student loan lenders or financial institutions. Interest rates tend to be lower on federal student loans than on private loans, but it's always smart to consider all of your options. Investopedia / Amelia Manley Private college loans can come from many sources, including banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions. You can apply for a private loan anytime and use the money for whatever expenses you wish, including tuition,\u00a0room and board,\u00a0books, computers, transportation, and living expenses. Unlike some federal loans, private loans are not based on a borrower's financial needs. You may have to pass a credit check to prove your creditworthiness. If you have little or no credit history or a poor one, you might need a co-signer on the loan. Private loans can come with higher borrowing limits than federal loans. The repayment period for student loans from private lenders may also be different. While some may allow you to defer payments until after you graduate, other lenders might require you to begin repaying your debt as you attend school. The U.S. Department of Education administers federal student loans. They tend to have lower interest rates and more flexible repayment plans than private loans. To qualify for a federal loan, you will need to complete and submit the government's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA asks questions about the student's and parent's income, investments, and other relevant matters, such as whether the family has other children in college. Using that information, the FAFSA determines your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). That figure is used to calculate how much assistance you're eligible to receive. The confusingly-named EFC has been renamed the Student Aid Index (SAI) to clarify its meaning. It does not indicate how much the student must pay the college. It is used to calculate how much student aid the applicant is eligible to receive. The relabeling will be implemented by the 2024-2025 school year. The financial aid offices at colleges and universities decide how much aid to offer by subtracting your (SAI) EFC from your cost of attendance (COA). The cost of attendance includes tuition, required fees, room and board, textbooks, and other expenses. To help make up the gap between what college costs and what the family can afford to pay, the financial aid office puts together an aid package. That package might include some combination of federal Pell Grants, federal loans, and paid work-study jobs. Schools can also draw on their own resources to offer\u2014for example, merit scholarships. The fundamental difference between grants and loans is that grants never have to be paid back (except in rare instances), while loans eventually do. The federal government made provisions to help student loan borrowers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, passed in March 2020, halted mandatory payments on federal student loans and froze the interest charged on them. A separate Biden administration plan to forgive part of the student loan debt of millions of student loan debtors was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2023. The administration immediately rolled out a new plan called Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE), allowing eligible borrowers to reduce their monthly payments, shorten the maximum period for loan repayment, and avoid some interest charges. The application for the SAVE plan became available in August 2023. People already enrolled in the REPAYE plan were automatically placed on the SAVE Plan. It's important to note that these proposed changes only applied to federal student loans, not private ones. Borrowers who need help with their private loans should approach their lenders for any provisions they may offer. On July 18, 2024, a federal appeals court blocked the SAVE plan until two court cases centered around the income-driven repayment (IDR) plan can be resolved. The Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into an interest-free forbearance while the litigation is ongoing. It has also outlined options for borrowers who were nearing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)\u2014borrowers can either \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if they reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan. The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program is\u00a0the largest and best-known of all federal student loan programs. These loans are sometimes called Stafford loans, the name of an earlier program. There are four basic types of federal direct loans: Note that a provision in the American Rescue Plan makes all student loan forgiveness federally tax-free from Jan. 1, 2021, to Dec. 31, 2025. Some states may tax the amount of a student loan forgiven as income. These loans are given to students depending on financial need. The government subsidizes the interest on the loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time. You are not charged interest on subsidized loans until you graduate, and you have a six-month grace period after leaving school before you need to begin making loan payments. If your loan is deferred, you will not be charged interest during that period. Unsubsidized loans are available to students regardless of financial need. Unlike subsidized loans, their interest begins accruing once you receive the funds and continues until the loan is repaid in full. Independent students who apply for a direct loan (as opposed to dependent students applying with their parents) can qualify for a higher amount of unsubsidized funds. Direct loans have several attractive benefits, including: However, they also have some downsides, such as: PLUS loans are designed for the parents of college students and are not based on\u00a0financial need. They have several appealing features, including the possibility of borrowing the total cost of attendance (minus any other financial aid or scholarships). They also carry a relatively low, fixed interest rate (but higher than the rates on other direct loan types) and offer flexible repayment plans, such as\u00a0the ability to defer payment until the\u00a0student graduates. PLUS loans require that the parent applicant pass a credit check (or obtain a co-signer or endorser) and reapply for funds each academic year. The parent is also legally responsible for repaying the loan. In addition to the parents of undergraduate students, PLUS loans are available to graduate and professional students. When it comes time to repay student loans, the government offers direct consolidation loans, which you can use to combine two or more federal education loans into a single loan with a fixed interest rate based on the average rate of the loans you are consolidating. You can't consolidate private loans using the federal program, but private lenders can consolidate your loans, both private and federal, by paying off your old loans and issuing you a new one. Consolidating with a private lender can get you a lower interest rate in some cases, but you'll lose the flexible repayment options and consumer protections that come with federal loans. If you have both federal and private loans, it makes sense to consolidate the federal ones through the government program and refinance the others with a private lender. Private college loans come from sources such as banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions. Federal student loans, administered by the U.S. Department of Education, usually have lower interest rates and more flexible repayment plans. Unlike government loans, private loans aren't based on financial need. Borrowers may have to pass a credit check to prove their creditworthiness. Borrowers with little or no credit history or low credit scores may need a co-signer on the loan. Private loans may have higher borrowing limits than federal loans. To qualify for a federal loan, you will need to complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. You'll answer questions about your and your family's income and financial circumstances. Using that information, the FAFSA determines the Expected Family Contribution, which is being rebranded as the Student Aid Index. That figure is used to calculate how much assistance you're eligible to receive. Loans are among the resources available to help students and their families pay college bills. Private and federal loans have advantages and disadvantages, depending on your situation. Private loans, administered by banks and credit unions, are much like any other kind of loan, meaning a credit check will be required. Federal loans are often needs-based, with lower interest rates and repayment flexibility. Those who do the necessary legwork will find options that best meet their needs.

            "content": "A beginner's guide to getting the loans you need to graduate Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University. Unless their parents have somehow saved enough money\u2014or earn massive salaries\u2014most students need to borrow to pay for college today. Working your way through college is also largely a thing of the past. Few students can make enough to pay for college while they're also taking classes. For that reason, student loans (and debt) have become increasingly common. Here's what you need to know about applying. The first step in applying for student loans is to fill out the government's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA asks a series of questions about the student's and parents' income and investments, in addition to other relevant matters. Based on the information you supply, the FAFSA will calculate your Student Aid Index (SAI), formerly known as the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). That's the amount of money the government believes you should be able to pay for college for the coming school year out of your own financial resources. You can complete the FAFSA online at the office of the Federal Student Aid website. To save time, round up all of your account information before you sit down to start work on it. You must not only complete the FAFSA when you first apply for aid but every year after that if you hope to continue receiving aid. The confusingly-named Expected Family Contribution (EFC) was renamed the Student Aid Index (SAI) in July 2023 as part of the FAFSA Simplification Act. It does not indicate how much the student must pay the college. It is used by the school to calculate how much student aid the applicant is eligible to receive. The transition is not just a name change. The SAI will not consider how many other children in the family may be in the higher education system and creates a new rubric for how Federal Pell Grants are awarded. The financial aid offices at the colleges you apply to will use the information from your FAFSA to determine how much aid to make available to you. They compute your need by subtracting your EFC from their cost of attendance (COA). Cost of attendance includes tuition, mandatory fees, room and board, and some other expenses. It can be found on most colleges' websites. In order to bridge the gap between your EFC and their COA, colleges will put together an aid package that may include federal Pell Grants and paid work-study, in addition to loans. Grants, unlike loans, do not need to be paid back, except in rare instances. They are intended for students with what the government considers \"exceptional financial need.\" Award letters can differ from college to college, so it's important to compare them side by side. In terms of loans, you'll want to look at how much money each school offers and whether the loans are subsidized or unsubsidized. Direct subsidized loans, like grants, are meant for students with exceptional financial need. The advantage of subsidized student loans is that the U.S. Department of Education will cover the interest while you're still at least a half-time student and for the first six months after you graduate. Direct unsubsidized loans are available to families regardless of need, and the interest will start accruing immediately. Payments and interest on these loans were suspended in 2020 during the economic crisis. Payments resume Oct. 2023, and interest will begin accruing on Sept. 1, 2023. If you qualify, a college might offer you both subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Federal loans have a number of advantages over student loans from banks and other private lenders. They have relatively low, fixed interest rates (private loans often have variable rates) and offer a variety of flexible repayment plans. However, the amount you can borrow is limited. For example, most first-year undergraduates can only borrow up to $5,500, of which no more than $3,500 can be in subsidized loans. There are also limits on how much you can borrow in total over the course of your college career. If you need to borrow more than that, one option is a federal direct PLUS Loan. PLUS loans are intended for the parents of undergraduates (as well as for professional and graduate students). PLUS loans have higher limits\u2014up to the full cost of attendance minus any other aid the student is receiving\u2014and are available regardless of need. However, the parent borrower must generally pass a credit check to prove their creditworthiness. Private student loans lack the flexible repayment options available with federal loans. Another option if you need to borrow more money than federal student loans can provide is to apply for a private loan from a bank, credit union, or other financial institution. Private loans are available regardless of need, and you apply for them using the financial institution's own forms rather than the FAFSA. To obtain a private loan, you will need to have a good credit rating or get someone who does have one, such as a parent or other relative, to co-sign on the loan. Having less-than-stellar credit can make it difficult to qualify for student loans. Private lenders will consider your income and credit history, and as a college student, you likely have poor credit or no credit at all. However, some lenders offer student loan options for borrowers with bad credit. Generally, private loans carry higher interest rates than federal loans, and these rates are variable rather than fixed, which adds some uncertainty to the question of how much you'll eventually owe. Private loans also lack the flexible repayment plans available with federal loans and are not eligible for loan consolidation under the Federal Direct Consolidation Loan program. However, you can refinance your private loans after you graduate, possibly at a lower interest rate. Each college will notify you of how much aid it is offering around the same time that you receive your official acceptance. This is often referred to as an award letter. In addition to federal aid, colleges may make money available out of their own funds, such as merit or athletic scholarships. How much you'll have to borrow to attend one school versus another may not be the most important factor in choosing a college. But it should definitely be high on the list. Graduating from college with an unmanageable amount of debt\u2014or, worse still, taking on debt and not graduating\u2014is not only a burden that might keep you up at night; it can limit\u2014or even derail\u2014your career and life choices for years to come. Also factor in the future careers you are considering when you choose to pay more for college. A career with a high entry-level salary will put you in a better position to repay your loans and justify taking on more debt. To qualify for a federal loan, you will need to complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Borrowers must answer questions about the student's and parents' income and investments, in addition to other relevant matters. Using that information, the FAFSA determines the Student Aid Index (SAI). That figure is used to calculate how much assistance you're eligible to receive. Federal loans have relatively low, fixed interest rates (private loans often have variable rates) and offer a variety of flexible repayment plans. Private loans, unlike those from the government, aren't based on financial need. Borrowers may have to pass a credit check to prove their creditworthiness. Borrowers with little or no credit history, or a poor score, may need a co-signer on the loan. Private loans may also have higher borrowing limits than federal loans. Like grants, direct subsidized loans are meant for students with exceptional financial need. The U.S. Department of Education will cover the interest while you're still at least a half-time student and for the first six months after you graduate. By contrast, direct unsubsidized loans are available to families regardless of need, and the interest will start accruing immediately. Student loans are among the resources available to help families pay college bills. Private and federal loans have advantages and disadvantages depending on your situation. Private loans, administered by banks and credit unions, are much like any other kind of loan, meaning a credit check will be required. Federal loans are often needs-based with lower interest rates and flexibility in repayment. Those who do the required legwork will find options that best meet their needs.

            "title": "The Impact of Canceling Student Debt",
            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Tom Werner / Getty Images President Joe Biden\u2019s efforts to cancel student debt for eligible borrowers would be welcomed relief and life-changing for many U.S. adults and families. Canceling this debt would be of particular benefit to households of color. However, for people who have never gone to college or have already paid off their loans, the impact would be minimal, and the economic impact may not be as positive as some think. On Aug. 24, 2022, the Biden-Harris administration announced its long-term student debt relief plan, but it was overruled by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2023. The plan featured three prongs: The application process for student loan forbearance was briefly opened, but legal challenges prompted the U.S. Department of Education to stop accepting applications indefinitely and pause processing applications that already were submitted. While the debt forgiveness plan was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court, the administration continued to pursue alternative measures for debt relief through loan forgiveness and income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. The pause on student loan interest ultimately ended on Sept. 1, 2023, and payments resumed on Oct. 1, 2023. Student loan forgiveness would apply to certain federal loans held by the Department of Education. Private loans are ineligible for forgiveness. President Biden announced the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan on June 30, 2023, which officially became available to student loan borrowers in August 2023. The plan cuts payments on undergraduate loans in half, reduces some borrowers\u2019 monthly loan payments to $0, ensures that balances don\u2019t grow as long as payments are kept up to date, and provides early forgiveness for low-balance borrowers. On July 18, 2024, a federal court blocked the operation of the SAVE plan until court cases centered around the IDR plan can be resolved. In the meantime, the Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into forbearance, whereby they will not need to make payments, nor will interest accrue on their loans.   Options exist for borrowers nearing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Borrowers can \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if they reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan. Note that while the American Rescue Plan makes student loan forgiveness granted from Jan. 1, 2021, to Dec. 31, 2025, tax-free at the federal level, some states may see it differently. Currently, forgiveness is expected to be taxed as income in Arkansas, California, Indiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. Though plenty of borrowers owe more than $10,000, any sort of student loan forgiveness would benefit them financially. Some economists believe loan forgiveness also would stimulate the economy as borrowers could use that money for other purposes, such as buying a home. For example, if you have $35,000 in student loan debt with a $300 monthly payment at a 4.66% interest rate, you\u2019ll pay almost $12,000 in interest over the course of 13 years. By canceling $10,000 of that student debt, you could save about $6,000 and pay off the rest of your debt five years sooner. Canceling student debt could be of particular benefit to lower-income borrowers, especially women and people of color. An academic paper in 2020 maintained that the \u201cmedian wealth for Black households overall, not just borrowers, would instantly increase by 42% with $75,000 in student debt forgiveness and around 34% with $50,000 in forgiveness.\u201d Those are higher amounts than President Biden has suggested but would be in keeping with his administration\u2019s initiatives to address racial equity. Refinancing your federal student loans into private student loans could mean losing eligibility for student loan forgiveness. Critics argue against canceling any amount of student loan debt, in part because it would unduly benefit a relatively privileged class of people: college students. While more than 45 million Americans have at least some student loan debt, they represent only approximately 13.5% of the U.S. population. In addition to concern regarding the fairness of the plan, it also is not without its costs. Fiscal experts estimate that loan cancellation would cost $519 billion over the course of a 10-year budget window. Add another $16 billion in forbearance for 2022 and potentially another $450 billion for the new IDR program, and the total sticker price could be near $1 trillion. That potential trillion dollars in forgiveness has to come from somewhere. Current estimates state that forgiveness will cost roughly $2,500 per taxpayer, whether they went to college or not. While forgiving student loans may have an impact on current borrowers, an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said they would expect student loan debt to return to $1.6 trillion by 2028. Since the plan does nothing to dampen higher education costs, it has no impact on current and future students facing historically high education costs. Student loan debt cancellation may have another negative impact: higher inflation rates. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the influx of $10,000 to $20,000 for millions of borrowers could push inflation rates even higher, with personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation increasing by 15 to 27 basis points. If federal student loan forgiveness does not go through and you are not able to get relief, then you may want to consider loan consolidation or student loan refinancing. Yes. The student debt relief plan applies only to federal loans held by the U.S. Department of Education. Those loans include undergraduate and graduate direct loans, Federal Family Education Loans (FFELs) and Perkins Loans held by the Department of Education, and certain defaulted loans held by the Department of Education. Three of the major arguments in favor of broad student debt cancellation are: It depends. Borrowers already enrolled in the Revised Pay as You Earn (REPAYE) plan were automatically enrolled in the new Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. Other borrowers had to submit an application to qualify. However, on July 18, 2024, a federal court blocked the SAVE plan from operating until court cases regarding the income-driven repayment (IDR) plan can be resolved. The Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into forbearance, meaning borrowers will not need to make payments, nor will interest accrue on their loans. Although there is a consensus that higher education reform, particularly regarding costs, is desirable, experts are divided on whether canceling some or all student loan debt is the best way to go about it. While those receiving forgiveness will see a financial benefit, there may be longer-reaching ramifications that will be more costly for all taxpayers in the long run.

            "title": "How to Afford America\u2019s Best Colleges",
            "content": "South_Agency / Getty Images Parents who want to have a handle on the costs of higher education would be wise to research tuition and fees for America's best colleges, as well as financial aid and private funding options that can help foot the bill. Read on for an overview of average costs for some of America's top schools, plus strategies families can use to reduce their out-of-pocket expenses, including investing in 529 accounts and similar plans, seeking help from employers, and applying for student aid. America's best colleges aren't inexpensive to attend, and that's especially true when you factor in costs for room and board, textbooks, and other necessary expenses. Here's a breakdown of some of these costs across the nation's best institutions. For the purposes of this article, the \u201cbest colleges\u201d are the 25 top colleges featured in Niche\u2019s 2025 Best Colleges in America list. Any figures from the National Center for Education Statistics cited in relation to these institutions is limited to out-of-state, full-time beginning undergraduate students attending four-year colleges during the 2023\u201324 academic year. The average cost of tuition and fees was $11,260 nationally for public, in-state, four-year schools for the 2023\u201324 academic year, according to the College Board. Meanwhile, the average cost of tuition and fees at private, nonprofit four-year schools was $41,540, which was up $1,600 from the 2022\u201323 academic year. Remember, these figures only account for one year of school. Tuition and fees at America's best colleges range from $44,524 per year at the University of California-Los Angeles to $69,045 at Columbia University. Additional schools with tuition and fees at the lower end of the scale include University of Michigan-Ann Arbor ($58,072) and Rice University ($58,128). Costs for room and board can be difficult to gauge and compare, especially when you break down the costs of both on-campus and off-campus housing. The College Board found that, for 2023\u201324, the average cost of room and board was $12,770 for public, in-state four-year schools. Room and board at private, nonprofit four-year schools, meanwhile, cost $14,650 on average. Data from the National Center for Education Statistics showed that room and board costs for America's best schools range from $11,182 for off-campus housing at Harvey Mudd College to $21,710 for on-campus housing at the same university. On average, textbooks and necessary supplies cost $1,250 for both public, in-state four-year schools and private, nonprofit four-year schools. The annual costs for books and supplies varied a bit more widely at America's top schools. These costs range from a low of $800 at Harvey Mudd College to $1,800 per year at the University of Chicago. Other potential expenses while in school will vary by student, but they may include transportation, clothing, leisure, and more. According to the CollegeBoard, on average, the combined cost of transportation and other expenses was $3,560 for public, in-state four-year schools and $2,980 for private, nonprofit four-year schools. Students at America's top schools can expect to pay as little as $1,400 per year toward personal expenses at both Carnegie Mellon University and Harvey Mudd College, or as much as $6,255 each year at Harvard University. The total cost of attendance (COA) for America's best schools includes tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, and potential personal expenses that pop up throughout the year. Per the College Board, the average COAs for public, in-state four-year schools and private, nonprofit four-year schools were $28,840 and $46,730, respectively. The National Center for Education Statistics found that the COA totals for America's best schools came in at $68,808 on-campus and $69,854 off-campus at the University of California-Los Angeles at the low end and as high as $91,290 per year at Northwestern University. While attending America's best colleges won't be cheap, most students and their families won\u2019t pay anything close to the sticker price. This is mostly because many students qualify for financial aid that reduces their out-of-pocket costs for school. That said, data from the Brookings Institution shows that more savings go toward students with demonstrated financial need, with less going to higher-income families. Paying for college becomes easier when you have a plan. Consider the following tips to help cover tuition and fees, living expenses, and other costs associated with earning a college degree. Financial aid can have a profound impact on the net price of college, which is the amount students and their parents actually pay for college. Consider the following financial aid options to help you fund a higher education: When it comes to applying for financial aid, there are a couple standard forms all families ought to fill out. Scholarships and grants can be considered the best type of financial aid, as these funds typically don\u2019t need to be repaid. After that, federal student loans are typically better than private student loans since they come with federal protections, including deferment and forbearance and access to income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. College Board data shows that the states with the lowest average tuition and fees for public two-year schools for the 2023\u201324 academic year were California ($1,440) and New Mexico ($2,130). Meanwhile, the states with the cheapest average tuition and fees for public four-year institutions during this same period were Florida ($6,360) and Wyoming ($6,700). The most affordable Ivy League school will vary based on each student and what kind of financial aid package they can qualify for. However, recent data suggests Princeton can be considered the most affordable Ivy League school due to its comparatively low cost of attendance (COA) and generous financial aid packages. America's best colleges tend to be expensive, so it's easy to see why so many students take out federal and private student loans. Figuring out how to pay for college, especially to attend one of these pricier institutions, tends to be more of a marathon than a sprint. The process can require years of diligent saving and planning, and many families have to use several strategies to keep costs down and avoid crushing student debt in the future.

            "title": "Are Direct Consolidation Loans Eligible for Forgiveness?",
            "content": "Vithun Khamsong / Getty Images Direct consolidation loans are eligible for federal student loan forgiveness, whether through an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), or Teacher Loan Forgiveness for qualifying teachers. Each of these forgiveness options has certain criteria you\u2019ll need to meet if you want to have your consolidated debt canceled. Direct consolidation loans combine\u2014or consolidate\u2014multiple federal student loans into one new loan. Private student loans aren\u2019t eligible for federal consolidation. Direct consolidation loans are one way to gain access to federal forgiveness options. In fact, if you have any student loans in default\u2014which are ineligible for forgiveness\u2014they can eventually qualify for debt cancellation if you consolidate them. The types of student loans eligible for consolidation include: Parents who take out direct PLUS loans on behalf of dependent students can\u2019t consolidate these with other federal loans that the student\u2014not the parent\u2014received. Under certain conditions, FFEL consolidation loans and direct consolidation loans can also qualify for further consolidation. Consolidating may reduce your monthly payment, which can be helpful if you\u2019re struggling to pay down your student debt. But you\u2019ll also likely end up making payments for longer than you would if you don\u2019t consolidate. There are four basic income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. Under each of them, your monthly payments are based on a percentage of your discretionary income. Your remaining balance is forgiven after 20 or 25 years of payments, depending on your plan. You\u2019re required to recertify every year to remain eligible for an IDR plan. You can also make changes throughout the year if your income or family size changes, ensuring your payments accurately reflect your household size and what you can afford to pay. Depending on what types of loans you have, you may have to consolidate them into a direct consolidation loan first before you can enroll in an IDR plan. Currently, direct consolidation loans are only eligible for the SAVE and IBR plans, as the PAYE and ICR aren\u2019t accepting new enrollments. However, if a direct consolidation loan was used to repay any parent PLUS loans, then it\u2019s eligible for the ICR plan (and only that plan). On July 18, 2024, a federal court blocked the operation of the SAVE plan until court cases centered around the IDR plan can be resolved. In the meantime, the Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into forbearance, whereby they will not need to make payments, nor will interest accrue on their loans. Options exist for borrowers nearing PSLF. Borrowers can \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if they reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan. If you work full-time for the government or a nonprofit organization with a qualifying employer, you might be eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). This program will require you to make 120 qualifying payments under an accepted repayment plan, after which any remaining balance on your loans is forgiven. All direct loans are eligible for PSLF. Qualifying repayment plans include: Teachers who have taught full-time for at least five consecutive years in a low-income school might qualify for forgiveness of up to $17,500 on direct loans, which can include direct consolidation loans. Subsidized direct loans, unsubsidized direct loans, subsidized federal Stafford loans, and unsubsidized federal Stafford loans are all eligible for Teacher Loan Forgiveness. Reachers with direct consolidation loans only qualify for forgiveness of whatever outstanding portions of the consolidation loans were used to repay any of the aforementioned direct and federal Stafford loan types. You can consolidate your loans after you graduate, leave school, or drop below half-time enrollment. You can also consolidate your loans while in repayment or during your grace period, which is the six-month period after you leave school but before you start repaying your student loans. Your new interest rate for a direct consolidation loan is the weighted average of the interest rates on the student loans being consolidated, rounded up to the nearest one-eighth percent. If your loans are currently in default, you can still consolidate them. You\u2019ll either need to make at least three consecutive monthly payments on your student loans prior to consolidating or agree to repay your direct consolidation loan under an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. No, consolidating your loans with a direct consolidation loan won\u2019t impact your credit score. Your new interest rate is the weighted average of your existing interest rates. As such, a lender isn\u2019t pulling your credit history or checking your credit report in order to calculate a new rate. Direct consolidation loans have a few different avenues for federal student debt forgiveness, including IDR plans, PSLF, or Teacher Loan Forgiveness. If you\u2019re hoping to get a direct consolidation loan forgiven, then the right option for you will depend on your financial situation, career, and what you can qualify for.

            "title": "What Happens if You Default on Private Student Loans?",
            "content": "Maskot / Getty Images Falling behind on private student loan payments could result in student loan default. When you default on your private student loans, lenders report this to the major credit bureaus, causing your credit score to drop. Those lenders may also hire collection agencies to go after your outstanding debt and/or sue you for outstanding payments. Private student loans are loans from private lenders, including banks, credit unions, online lenders, and agencies other than the federal government. As with federal student loans, you can use private student loans to pay for school and other education-related expenses, such as tuition and fees, room and board, technology and supplies, transportation, child care, etc. While you can only receive federal student loans by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) within a specific time frame, you can apply for private student loans at any point while you\u2019re in school. Federal loans offer deferment, forbearance, income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, and debt forgiveness opportunities. Private student loans don\u2019t. There\u2019s no universal timeline for when unpaid private student loans are considered to be in default, but private lenders will typically wait at least three months. Many lenders are willing to help borrowers avoid falling behind on their payments. If you\u2019re at risk of defaulting, call your lender and explain your situation. You may be able to work out a temporary payment plan. You\u2019ll have to be willing to compromise on a solution that works for both of you, though it\u2019s still worth asking what options are available before agreeing to anything. Some lenders offer hardship programs, while others might be willing to temporarily modify your loans while you\u2019re going through a difficult time. You may want to look into government or nonprofit agency assistance programs that offer repayment help at the local, state, and federal levels. Refinancing your student loan means taking out a new loan that pays off your older, outstanding debt. By refinancing, you\u2019ll get a new repayment term and interest rate. Sometimes, this new repayment term will be longer or the interest rate will be lower, which would reduce your monthly payment. Refinancing doesn\u2019t guarantee a lower monthly payment, however. Private student loans, defaulted or otherwise, aren\u2019t eligible for any federal forgiveness options. If you\u2019ve defaulted on a federal student loan, you\u2019ll no longer be eligible for federal loan forgiveness. You can become eligible again by consolidating your defaulted federal student loan into a direct consolidation loan. Bankruptcy can potentially discharge private student loan debt. Not all borrowers will be able to get their student debt discharged in bankruptcy, however, as it depends on the type of bankruptcy filing, the kind of loans taken out, and each borrower's case. When you miss payments or default on your private student loan, your credit score drops\u2014and so does your co-signer\u2019s. A co-signer is just as responsible for a loan as the original borrower, so they could also face legal trouble if you can't or won\u2019t repay your debt. If you default on a private student loan, you can face both short- and long-term financial consequences. Your credit score can decline, and you may have trouble qualifying for other lending products. A defaulted loan will also stay on your credit report for several years. If you have a co-signer, defaulting on your loan can have a negative financial impact on them as well. Carefully consider the downsides of defaulting before you take out a private student loan.

            "content": "Is it better to pay off student loans early, or should you focus on other goals first? Tom Werner / Getty Images Is it better to pay off your student loans early? On the one hand, you could be out of debt sooner and save on interest, but on the other hand, you might miss out on opportunities to invest or get ahead on your savings. Additionally, you might miss out on student loan forgiveness if you pay down your debt too quickly. Understanding your current financial situation and long-term goals can help you decide whether to tackle student debt immediately or work on other financial goals first. There are two main types of student loans: Carrying student debt can impact your ability to accomplish other financial goals, especially if it takes a long time to pay off your student loans. For example, student loans affect your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, potentially reducing how much you can borrow for a mortgage. Missing payments can also affect your credit score, making it difficult for you to get other loans. However, even though student loans can impact your finances, deciding whether to pay them off early can be a tough choice because it comes with an opportunity cost. Interest savings Psychological benefits Increased financial flexibility Opportunity cost Liquidity concerns Loss of tax benefits Deciding to pay off your student loans early can have benefits, depending on your situation and financial goals. If you want to\u00a0pay off student loans early, review your budget to see where to cut expenses. Put the savings toward extra principal payments. Make sure you make extra payments separately and designate them toward the principal rather than having them go toward interest and fees first. Yes, you can pay off your student loans at any time. Both private and federal student loans can be paid off early, typically without any prepayment penalties. Refinancing your student loans can potentially reduce your interest rate and help you pay off your debt faster. However, if you refinance federal loans, you lose access to loan forgiveness and income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. Carefully consider whether you think you'll need these programs before deciding to refinance your student loans. It depends on what kind of loans they are. For example, private student loans usually have terms ranging from five to 20 years. Federal loan repayment is based on the type of plan. The standard repayment plan is 10 years, but IDR plans and federal direct consolidation loan have longer terms. Before paying off your student loans early, consider your situation and long-term financial goals. Weigh the advantages of paying off your loans early against the opportunity cost and loss of tax benefits to determine what makes the most financial sense for you.

            "title": "Fixed vs. Variable Student Loans: Which Is Right for You?",
            "content": "Could you get a better deal with a private variable-rate student loan? JGI / Jamie Grill / Getty Images If you need loans to pay for school, you have two basic choices: federal or private student loans. Federal student loans have fixed interest rates set by a formula, while private student loans can have fixed or variable rates. Fixed rates remain the same throughout the loan term, while variable rates can change based on market rates. Here's what you need to know about fixed vs. variable student loans. When you borrow money, the lender charges you a cost for using their capital. This cost is called interest. The amount you pay in interest is an annual percentage of your loan balance. A fixed interest rate is set for the entire loan term. When you have a fixed interest rate, your payment will remain constant, allowing you to budget effectively. You always know exactly how much you will pay each month. However, because fixed rates don't change, you don't benefit if interest rates drop in the future. Federal student loans always come with fixed rates, which are set each year using a formula approved by Congress and based on the 10-year Treasury note. Each year, a new student loan rate is set for loans disbursed that year. For the 2024\u201325 academic year, the rate for direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans is 6.53%, up from 5.50% for loans disbursed during the 2023\u201324 academic year. Variable student loan rates change based on market conditions. Each lender regularly examines a benchmark rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). Then, the loan's interest rate is adjusted up or down based on this benchmark's movement. Your loan agreement indicates how often the rate changes and includes caps on how high it can go. While many private student lenders offer fixed-rate options, some offer variable-rate student loans. Your initial rate is set based on your credit score, income, and market conditions. Depending on your situation, you might qualify for a lower rate than you'd get with a fixed-rate federal loan. However, since all variable-rate student loans are private loans, a major advantage of fixed-rate student loans you'd be missing out on are their benefits and protections. For instance, federal student loans have access to income-driven repayment (IDR) plans that base your monthly payment on your discretionary income. At the end of the plan's term, any remaining loan balance is forgiven. Additionally, if you're struggling to repay your debt, federal student loans have forbearance and deferment options, in addition to other forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). While you can save money initially with a variable-rate student loan, your payment doesn't remain predictable, and you risk paying more over the long term if rates head higher. When evaluating fixed vs. variable student loan rates, it's important to consider your financial situation and weigh potential long-term costs. For example, consider $20,000 in student loans to be paid off in 20 years. As you can see, a fixed vs. variable student loan can make a big difference, depending on whether you qualify for a low initial rate and market conditions. Predictable payments, making it easier to budget Maintain a lower rate, even when interest rates trend higher If rates fall, you still pay a higher interest rate Payments could be lower if rates fall Could pay more in interest over time if rates rise high enough Harder to plan a budget when payments might change Won't have access to the benefits and protections of federal student loans You usually can't switch between fixed and variable rates during your loan term. Instead, if you want to change whether you have a fixed or variable rate, you usually need to refinance into a new student loan. Yes, you can pay off a fixed loan early, including federal student loans. When you pay off your federal student loans early, you generally won't face any prepayment penalties. For fixed-rate private student loans, you'll need to check with your lender as to whether they levy a prepayment penalty or not. Federal student loan rates are fixed. However, each year the fixed rate for loans disbursed that year is set by a formula. If you decide to consolidate your student loans into a direct consolidation loan, your new fixed rate will be the weighted average of the loans you're consolidating, rounded up to the closest one-eighth of 1%. When deciding between fixed- vs. variable-rate student loans, it's essential to consider whether you can afford the potential changes to your budget that might come with variable rates adjusting upward. Additionally, you need to determine whether you want have access to the benefits of federal student loans. If you choose federal loans, you'll have a fixed rate that isn't influenced by your income or credit.

            "title": "When Do I Start Paying My Student Loans?",
            "content": "Your repayment period can differ depending on the type of loans you have and your lender Damircudic / Getty Images Most federal student loans start repayment six months after you leave school. Private student loans, however, might require immediate payments. Additionally, other types of loans might come with different repayment rules. Here's what you need to know about when to start paying student loans. Your student loan agreement usually lets you know when you can expect to start repayment. It's important to read the terms carefully in order to understand whether you need to make payments while you're in school or can wait until after you leave school. When you begin repaying student loans depends on your loan type. Most student loans begin repayment after you leave school, which means it's not contingent on graduation. If you don't graduate or if you drop below half-time enrollment, the time period for repayment begins. Many student loans come with a grace period. This period begins when you leave school or drop below half-time enrollment, and it ends when you make your first student loan payment. For federal student loans, that grace period is six months. You're not required to make a student loan payment during the grace period. As your grace period ends, your student loan servicer will contact you to explain how to make your first payment. You might also receive information on setting up an online payment account. If you know you won't be able to afford your student loan payment after the grace period ends, you should review alternate payment plans. Federal loans are eligible for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans that reduce how much you pay based on your disposable income. In some cases, your monthly payment can be $0. You can also ask your servicer about student loan forbearance or deferment if you have financial hardship. With direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans, you don't need to make student loan payments while enrolled in school at least half-time. However, six months after you leave school\u2014either through completing your program or dropping below half-time enrollment\u2014you're supposed to start repaying your debt. Your loan servicer should provide you with a repayment schedule at least 30 days before your first payment is due at the end of your grace period. Your first bill should arrive at least 21 days before your first due date. PLUS loans that are issued to graduate and professional students technically enter repayment as soon as they're disbursed. However, PLUS loans are automatically deferred while you're attending school at least half-time. Parent PLUS loans, which parents use to cover the cost of their child's schooling, also enter repayment immediately after being disbursed. Parents can request deferment until their child leaves school, including deferment for the six-month grace period. If you decide to consolidate your federal student loans under a direct consolidation loan, you can push your first payment due date out a little further. Once the new loan is disbursed, your first payment will be 60 days later. You can wait until near the end of your grace period to consolidate. Your loan servicer will let you know when your first student loan payment will be. Private student loans operate differently because non-federal entities provide them. Each lender determines its own policies. Read the loan agreement carefully before signing the paperwork to understand what to expect. Some private student lenders require you to make payments once you receive the funds. If your parent took the loan on your behalf, immediate repayment might also be required. If your loan does require immediate repayment, make sure your budget can handle the monthly obligation. You might be able to get an in-school deferment, allowing you to wait to make payments until you leave school. Additionally, some private student lenders allow a grace period after you leave school. Talk to your lender about the options and how you can reduce some of your financial stress while attending school. Not every private student lender offers hardship programs if you can't make your first payment. To find out if that may be an option for your private loans, talk to your servicer if you're uncertain whether you can make your student debt payments. How long it takes to pay off student loans depends on the type of loan and your repayment plan. Federal student loans have repayment terms ranging from 10 to 30 years, and private lenders usually have terms ranging from five to 20 years. You can also make additional payments to repay your debt early. If your financial situation changes, contact your servicer to determine your next move. Federal student loans come with income-driven repayment (IDR) options, in addition to forbearance and deferment possibilities. For private student loans, talk to your lender to find out whether have a hardship program. Because student loans are a type of debt, missing payments can be reported on your credit history and impact your credit score. If you miss too many payments, you might be considered in default. If you go into default with federal student loans, it can affect your ability to receive federal benefits. When you get student loans, you're expected to repay the debt. However, in many cases, you have a grace period before your first payment. Check your repayment schedule and watch for information for your servicer to ensure you make your payments on time.

            "title": "What Is Capitalized Interest on a Student Loan?",
            "content": "SDI Productions / Getty Images Capitalized interest is unpaid interest that gets added to your student loan\u2019s principal balance. Because that balance has increased, subsequent interest may be charged on that new, larger amount. For student loans, capitalization only occurs under certain conditions, such as if you\u2019re in a forbearance period or on an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. Learn more about capitalized interest on student loans as well as how to manage the impact of student loan interest. There are two types of student loans: subsidized and unsubsidized. With subsidized loans, the government covers the interest charges while you\u2019re in school, so interest won\u2019t accrue until you graduate or drop below half-time enrollment. Both the federal government and private lenders offer unsubsidized loans, in which interest accrues while you\u2019re in school, even if you aren\u2019t required to make payments during this time. Depending on the details of your loan (i.e., whether they\u2019re federal or private, if the United States Department of Education is managing them, etc.), the circumstances under which capitalization can occur on your student loans may include: Suppose you\u2019re attending a four-year college. In order to fund your education, each year you borrow $10,000 from a private lender at a 5% interest rate. Payments aren\u2019t required while you\u2019re in school, but interest will still accrue during that time and will capitalize once you graduate. You can calculate your daily interest charge by dividing 5% by 365, which equals 0.000136. Next, multiply this amount by $10,000 to get your daily interest charge of $1.36. Each day after taking out the initial loan, you\u2019re being charged approximately $1.36 in interest. That\u2019s $40.80 in interest charges per month, or $489.60 per year. Below is how much capitalized interest will have accrued on all four of those $10,000 loans by the time you graduate, assuming no early payments. After capitalization, your new principal balances will be $11,958.40, $11,468.80, $10,979.20, and $10,489.60, respectively. All four loans will now have higher daily interest rates, significantly increasing the cost of your loans in the long term. If your student loans had been subsidized, you would\u2019ve had the same $1.36 daily interest charge after you graduated. Capitalization goes into effect when unpaid interest charges are added to your principal balance, and then subsequent interest is calculated on the new, higher amount. As such, you\u2019ll be charged interest on your interest. Capitalization increases your total loan balance due to the added interest becoming part of your outstanding loan balance. Since you\u2019ll owe more than you originally borrowed, your monthly payment may also increase. Having to put more money toward paying a capitalized student loan means saving less for other things, including emergencies, retirement, or a major purchase. This likely won\u2019t be a concern for borrowers on IDR plans, which base their monthly payments on a percentage of your discretionary income. While unpaid interest will still capitalize if your monthly payments are less than what accrues each month, any remaining loan balance after the repayment period ends is ultimately forgiven. If you\u2019re concerned about capitalized interest on your student loans, the best way to lessen or negate it entirely is to keep making payments, even if they aren\u2019t required. If you have the funds, putting even a few dollars toward your unsubsidized loans every month while you\u2019re in school, during your grace period, or while in deferment can help you avoid higher capitalization costs in the long term. If the Education Department isn\u2019t managing your loans and they\u2019re in forbearance, the same advice applies. To calculate a student loan\u2019s interest, you\u2019ll first need to calculate its daily interest rate by dividing the annual interest rate by the number of days in a year (365). Next, you\u2019ll multiply the result of the prior calculation by the loan\u2019s outstanding principal. Finally, multiply that amount by 30 (representing the number of days in a typical month) to get the monthly interest charge. Because capitalized interest becomes part of your loan\u2019s principal balance, it doesn\u2019t really affect loan forgiveness programs. If you qualify for a forgiveness program, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), your capitalized interest will be included in that forgiven balance. Outstanding interest refers to interest charges on your student loans that you have yet to pay. Capitalized interest on a student loan can significantly increase how much you owe on your student loans by the time you start repayment. If you can avoid capitalization by getting a subsidized loan, it could save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars in the long run. If you can't avoid it, try making payments while you're in school (or whenever else you aren\u2019t required to make payments) to lessen the impact of capitalization down the line.

            "title": "Are Student Loans Predatory?",
            "content": "Gerardo Huitr\u00f3n / GettyImages Predatory lending refers to a range of lending practices that can harm consumers\u2019 finances. For example, predatory loans may obscure the true loan obligation, or they might come with a slew of hidden fees and fine print. These loans typically aren\u2019t based on the borrower's ability to repay, and they often have no consumer protections that apply to other types of borrowing. Student loans aren\u2019t predatory, but they can still potentially lead to financial problems if they\u2019re not managed correctly. Outstanding student loan debt in the United States reached $1.61 trillion in the third quarter of 2024, and many students struggle to repay. Add in the fact that student loans are difficult to discharge in bankruptcy, and it's easy to see where problems can arise for borrowers who take on too much. Some of the best student loans offer more protections than others, however, so it's important to understand which types are available to consumers. There are two main types of student loans: federal student loans and private student loans. The chart below highlights some of the differences between these loans, the way they work, and the protections they provide. Federal student loans have fixed interest rates that are set by Congress each year and vary by loan type. Borrowers can easily find out the exact interest rate they'll pay on these loans, in addition to any funding fees that apply. They can also choose their repayment plan upfront to lock in a monthly payment they can afford. Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans for federal student loans can even help borrowers get a monthly payment as low as $0 based on their income, and they lead to forgiveness of remaining loan balances after 20 to 25 years (depending on the chosen plan). When it comes to private student loans, however, the terms aren't quite as standard. These loans can come with fixed or variable interest rates depending on the lender, and borrowers can choose from several different repayment terms. Unlike federal student loans, private student loans typically require borrowers to have a proven income and a good credit score or better. Borrowers who cannot meet the requirements for private student loans may have the option to apply with a co-signer. While student loans can lead borrowers into financial peril, they aren\u2019t predatory. Student loans may come with fixed or variable interest rates, but rates and all fees are disclosed upfront with both federal and private student loans. This isn't the case for predatory loans like payday loans that hide various fees that leave consumers paying the equivalent of almost 400% annual percentage rate (APR), per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Examples of predatory lending include not only payday loans, but also loans with hidden balloon payments, asset-based lending, steering into expensive subprime loans, loan flipping, and more. The Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School also says that predatory loans often feature high interest rates and fees, fail to disclose important information, disclose false information, or use risk-based pricing. True predatory lending uses fraud and deception to hide the true terms of a loan, which isn't the case for federal or private student loans. Federal student loans in particular come with a range of protections for consumers, including federal deferment and forbearance as well as access to IDR plans. Unfortunately, student loans are notoriously difficult to discharge in bankruptcy, which means borrowers who get in over their heads have little recourse when it comes to getting out of debt. Government agencies have put some restrictions in place to protect against predatory lending practices, although these often vary by state. For example, according to the CFPB, some states limit loan fees on payday loans. Average student debt in the U.S. reached $38,175.36 per borrower as of the third quarter of 2024. Student loan debt hurts your credit if you make late payments or let your loans lapse and go into default. If you always make on-time payments on your student loans, however, paying them off should help boost your credit score over time. Student loan forgiveness could have a diverse impact on the economy, and predictions largely depend on who you ask. Forgiving student debt would inevitably add to the federal budget deficit and the national debt, which is largely seen as a negative impact. However, some economists (and the Biden administration) agree that forgiving student debt would lead to more consumer spending and an overall boost to the economy. Student loans aren't predatory in the same way other types of lending can be, but these loans can still wreak havoc on your finances. This is especially true if you overborrow for a degree that doesn't have a solid return on investment (ROI), or if you find yourself unable to repay your loans but also unable to discharge them in bankruptcy. Then again, federal student loans have IDR plans with monthly payments as low as $0 for those who qualify. These plans can be a lifeline for borrowers who have low incomes and can qualify for affordable monthly payments, and the benefits apply regardless of the loan balance.

            "content": "skynesher / Getty Images Under certain federal programs, it\u2019s possible to get your student loans forgiven after 20 years of qualified payments. Private student loans, however, typically don't have forgiveness options, regardless of how long you pay them. Learn about how private student loans work and your options for managing them. While federal student loans come from the government, private student loans come from private lenders, such as banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Loans from your school might also be private student loans. You usually need a pretty good credit score to qualify for a private student loan on your own. Alternatively, you can get a co-signer to help you qualify, so long as they have good credit and are willing to become liable for the debt in the event you cannot pay it back. Most federal student loans don't require a credit check, but most private student loans do. The better your (or your co-signer's) credit score and history, the lower your interest rate. For federal student loans, interest rates are set by Congress annually. For federal student loans, you might be able to secure forgiveness through Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), Teacher Loan Forgiveness, an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, or situation-dependent discharges (such as if your school closed or misled you).\u00a0 While some IDR plans will forgive your student loans after 20 years of payments, that's not true for private student loans. This is because there's no universal private student loan forgiveness program. Private lenders may offer loan forgiveness programs if they'd like to do so, but they aren\u2019t required to. Student loans from state agencies, which are considered private loans, may be forgiven under specific circumstances. For instance, the state of New York offers loan forgiveness programs for borrowers in certain qualifying fields, including farming, teaching, and social work. Your private student loans may be forgivable if you become permanently disabled or pass away. However, whether or not this option is available will also depend on the lender, as lenders aren\u2019t legally required to cancel debt in these circumstances. Private student loans aren't eligible for federal student loan forgiveness options. If you have private student loans, refinancing them can lower your interest rate, lengthen your repayment term, or both. Your lender will pay off your old, outstanding loans, and then you'll start paying for your new loan with a new interest rate and repayment terms. Refinancing could lower your monthly payments. However, if you refinance federal student loans with a private lender, you lose access to federal benefits like deferment, forbearance, IDR plans, and debt cancellation. Lenders typically want you to stay current on your loans. If you\u2019re behind on your student debt payments, call your lender and ask if they\u2019re willing to lower your payments, interest rates, or both. Bear in mind that private lenders aren't required to help you out, so you may need to show some proof of hardship to get them to approve your request. If your lender offers you a compromise, make sure you get the terms in writing. Student loan bankruptcy should be an option of last resort, as it can have long-term adverse effects on your credit. In many cases, however, your student loans won\u2019t qualify for being discharged in bankruptcy. You may have a better chance of getting private student debt discharged compared to federal loans, since the former can be used for things other than \u201cqualified higher education expenses,\u201d but this is still far from guaranteed. If you file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the court liquidates your assets to pay off your outstanding debt.\u00a0 If you have assets you don't want to lose, such as your home, you can file Chapter 13 bankruptcy. This option is more like a restructured payment plan where you'll pay off your outstanding debt within three to five years. The court decides if your private student loan debt will be included in this repayment plan. Bankruptcy has long-lasting effects on your credit report and history. Before declaring bankruptcy, consider talking to a nonprofit credit counselor or your lender. Your federal student loans might be eligible for forgiveness depending on what type they are, their repayment plan, how long they\u2019ve been in repayment, and where you work. Private student loans aren't eligible for federal debt forgiveness. If you\u2019re able to secure a lower interest rate, refinancing should lower your monthly payments. You could also refinance to get a longer repayment term, which would also mean smaller monthly payments, though you may end up paying more over the life of the loan. Refinancing doesn\u2019t guarantee you a lower interest rate. Unless you can check what rate you\u2019ll be offered by getting pre-qualified for a refinanced student loan, you could end up with a higher interest rate than what you\u2019re paying on your current loans. Unlike federal student loans, private student loans aren't eligible for forgiveness at the federal level. Private lenders aren't required to offer any forgiveness programs, regardless of how long a borrower has been in repayment. With fewer benefits and no path to forgiveness, private student loans are typically best left as a last resort when you\u2019re still left with fund gaps after taking all of your other sources of financial aid into account.

            "content": "FG Trade/Getty Image Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) is a federal program that allows eligible borrowers to have some of their education debt forgiven. The program was established in 2007 for the benefit of borrowers pursuing careers in the public service sector and began accepting applications in 2017. In addition to working in an eligible career field, borrowers must satisfy other conditions to qualify for PSLF, including making a set number of qualifying payments. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 was introduced as part of an effort to make higher education more accessible and affordable for low-income students. The act expanded Pell Grant funding and introduced the PSLF program. This was meant to serve two purposes: The Department of Education estimates that borrowers who qualify for PSLF receive close to $70,000 in relief, on average. Borrowers who are ineligible for PSLF may still qualify for student loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years of payments by enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan. There are a number of eligibility requirements borrowers must meet to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. You must: Serving in the Peace Corps or as a full-time AmeriCorps volunteer also counts as qualifying employment for PSLF. You can use the Department of Education's employer search tool to find out if your employer is PSLF-eligible. To apply for PSLF, you'll need to begin working for an eligible employer and make sure that you're enrolled in either an income-driven repayment plan or a Standard 10-year Repayment plan. If you meet those requirements, you'll next need to submit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Certification and Application form annually. You must provide information about your employer on the form, and your employer must certify the information in Section 5A. After you've made 120 qualifying payments on your Direct Loans, you'll submit the form again to apply for forgiveness of your remaining loan balance. Forms can be mailed to the Department of Education or submitted online via the StudentAid.gov website. You can use the PSLF Form help tool to: Once you submit your form, the Department of Education will review your payment history to determine whether you're eligible for PSLF. You can track the status of your application through the StudentAid.gov portal. A qualifying monthly payment is any payment you make while employed full-time by a qualifying employer under a qualifying repayment plan and for the full amount due that's shown on your bill. Payments you would have otherwise had to make during qualifying periods of deferment or forbearance also count toward the total. Qualifying periods include deferments or forbearance related to: You'll still need to certify your employment during these periods to have your payments included in your total. Payments don't need to be consecutive. If you move from a public service job to a private sector one, for instance, any payments you make during your period of private sector employment wouldn't count. But you could resume qualifying payments once you return to a public service job. Enrolling in automatic payments is a simple way to ensure you're paying as agreed, and you may also qualify for a rate discount with your loan servicer. Annual employment certification is necessary to ensure that the payments you're making qualify for your PSLF eligibility. When you fill out the annual certification form, your employer must verify certain information, including: If you submit your PSLF form without this information or with incomplete employer information, the Department of Education may contact your employer to verify its accuracy. Once you have completed 120 payments on your Direct Loans and met the other requirements, you are ready to submit a final PSLF form to the Department of Education. It will then review your payment history to determine your eligibility for forgiveness. When you submit the final PSLF form, you'll need to be sure that the employment period is checked as \"still employed\" or certified by your employer in the same month as your employment end date. Once your loans are forgiven, you won't owe anything else to the remaining balance. The Internal Revenue Service doesn't consider student loan debt forgiven through PSLF to be taxable income, as it does with some other types of loans. However, your state could still tax you. You may want to talk to a tax professional about how PSLF could affect your filing that year. Public Service Loan Forgiveness can offer financial relief to borrowers, but qualifying can be an obstacle for some. The program has strict requirements regarding employer eligibility, loan eligibility, and annual certification. That puts a burden on borrowers to ensure that their work, loan type, and payment history qualify them for PSLF. Borrowers who are denied PSLF can submit an appeal for reconsideration, though that isn't a guarantee. You'll still need to prove that you checked off all the boxes to satisfy PSLF requirements. The Department of Education offers a variety of online tools and resources to help borrowers better understand their PSLF eligibility and how to apply. The PSLF Help Tool, for example, can help you to: If you need direct help from a person, you can contact the Department of Education by phone, email, or chat. Changes in PSLF regulations now allow borrowers to \"buy back\" certain months in their payment history to have them count toward their 120 qualifying payments. If you were enrolled in a deferment or forbearance period that didn't count toward your total, you can buy those payments back to make them count. To do that, the Department of Education explains, \"You must make an extra payment of at least as much as what you would have made under an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan during the months you're trying to buy back.\" However, you are eligible for a buyback only if: The Biden administration's Saving for a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan was introduced in 2023 as a new income-driven repayment option for PSLF-seekers. However, litigation has halted the program's implementation, forcing many borrowers into forbearance. Until the litigation is resolved, payments that borrowers would otherwise have been required to make will not count toward their PSLF totals. Qualifying payments for PSLF include those made under an income-driven repayment plan or a Standard 10-year Repayment plan. If you're making payments under a Graduated or Extended Repayment plan, they wouldn't be eligible for your 120 qualifying payment total. Payments must also be made monthly to qualify, though they do not need to be consecutive. The IRS has said that it will not include student debt forgiven through PSLF as part of your taxable income. However, your state could still assess taxes on forgiven balances. Talking to a tax expert can help you better understand potential tax impact. PSLF doesn't involve a credit check so it wouldn't impact your score that way. The payments you make toward your loans can affect your scores, however. On-time payments on student loans can help your scores, while late or missed payments can hurt them. Public Service Loan Forgiveness may be available to you if you're working in a public service field, have Direct Loans, and make 120 qualifying payments. If you have private student loans or you're working in a field other than public service, you likely won't be eligible. The best resource for learning more about PSLF is the Department of Education's StudentAid.gov website. There, you can learn about the eligibility requirements and how to apply, and also get the latest updates on regulatory changes or litigation that may impact PSLF borrowers.

            "title": "The Student Loan Debt Crisis: Its Impact on the Economy May Be More Than You Think",
            "content": "High levels of student loan debt can impact financial decisions Student loan balances can have a significant impact on the economy because they prevent borrowers from moving forward with other financial plans like buying a home or a car. Student loan debt also hinders spending by limiting the amount of free cash in consumers' pockets. Learn about the different ways the United State's economy could be affected with so many people burdened by student loan payments. As of Q3 2024, more than 42 million Americans held outstanding federal loan debt totaling more than $1.6 trillion. The amount of debt has led to concerns about potential economic impacts. On a personal level, student loan debt can impact your finances when it limits other activities like buying a home, starting a business, or simply spending money on goods and services. When a significant number of people carry either federal or private student loans, the effect on the economy is generally negative because of reduced spending and other factors. Here are several ways student loan debt can restrict your financial plans and impact the economy. An increase in student debt has been found to correlate with fewer new small businesses, which are often cited as the backbone of the economy, per data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. In fact, the rise in student loan debt in recent years has indeed contributed to a decline in the number of new entrepreneurs aged 20 to 34, according to a study by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. New businesses add to economic growth in many ways, including by providing jobs. Student loan debt impacts your ability to get business loans to start a new venture, as it increases your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. When you have to pay a student loan each month, you also have less cash to invest in your business. The drop-off in homeownership following the Great Recession was higher for those aged 24 to 32 than for the overall population. Student loan debt might have had an impact on that, with estimates indicating that every $1,000 in student loan debt reduces the homeownership rate by about 1.8% for those who attended public four-year institutions. Rising home prices combined with both higher interest rates and student loan payments create a delay in the milestone of homeownership. Indeed, since student loan debt can impact your DTI ratio, that makes it more difficult to qualify for a mortgage with high student loan balances. Carrying a lot of student debt can make it more difficult to keep up with payments during economic downturns. The need to repay your student loan can reduce your ability to build an emergency fund for necessary expenses should you lose your job or face unexpected bills. Many borrowers may turn to credit counseling services to help, but these businesses aren't always legitimate. Student loan debt can reduce people's ability to spend money, lowering consumer spending, which is a cornerstone of economic growth. Essentially, student loan debt lowers your disposable income, so you can't spend as much on discretionary items. In turn, businesses that sell these goods and services don't turn a profit. Student loan debt can also cause borrowers to delay important life milestones such as marriage, having children, and retirement, all of which require money. The state of Pennsylvania analyzed the potential impact on the state economy when student loan payments resumed in the fall of 2023, and a decline in tax revenue was expected as a result, including a drop of $125 million in state income from sales and use taxes. Meanwhile, the New York Federal Reserve estimated that student loan repayments resuming in 2023 would lead to a $1.6 billion monthly drop in U.S. consumer spending. When saving for retirement, those with student loan debt have a harder time than those without. Indeed, a 2019 study found that 84% of people with student loans said their debt limits their ability to save for retirement. When people have insufficient retirement savings and are more reliant on programs like Social Security, they have little choice but to live a more frugal lifestyle and spend less in retirement. In some cases, student loan debt burdens disempower some students by limiting their financial or life choices. These students may be forced to make decisions they might not make otherwise to afford a higher education, such as sacrificing time that could be spent studying or resting to work a part-time job, in the hopes of a better income down the line. Additionally, graduates who might otherwise seek work they'd find more fulfilling, such as lower-paid public service jobs, could turn away from this career path in favor of higher-paying jobs that will enable them to more easily make their loan payments. Even with some of the negative economic impacts of high levels of student loan debt, there are some positive aspects to consider as well. Research indicates that those with bachelor's degrees earned more over their lifetimes than those with high school diplomas, according to the Social Security Administration. Graduate degrees, which would mean taking on more debt, can potentially further increase a student's earning potential. For example, men and women with graduate degrees earned, on average, $1.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively, more over their lifetimes than their counterparts with high school diplomas. Student loan debt can lead to the delaying of milestones, such as buying a home and starting a family, that generally require expenditures. The absence of these expenditures limits the economic growth of businesses that would have profited from them. In general, if you have high amounts of student loan debt relative to your income, you are more likely to reduce your discretionary spending. With more money going to student loan payments, you have less to spend on other things. So, generally speaking, student loan debt reduces consumer spending. There are two factors that can be attributed to the negative correlation between student debt and homeownership. The first is that student loan payments strain a potential homeowner's budget, thus they may need more time to save up (and that's assuming they can even keep up with rising home prices). The second is that having outstanding debt increases your DTI ratio, which is a percentage that lenders often use to determine your borrowing risk. As such, a person with high student loan debt and a lower-paying job (which is likely to be the case for a recent graduate) may be unable to qualify for a mortgage. Large amounts of student loan debt can reduce economic activity in a consumer economy in many ways. For individuals, it can strain your personal budget, which can result in you spending less. As part of a larger trend, this would lead to less spending, which is a major factor in economic growth.

            "title": "How Is a Student Loan Different From a Scholarship?",
            "content": "Westend61 / Getty Images You can pay for college in a couple different ways, including using scholarships and student loans. While both are types of student aid, the former are monetary gifts that don\u2019t have to be repaid, whereas the latter are debt products that you typically will need to pay back. Depending on the cost of school, family contributions, and how much you can earn in free aid, you might need to take out student loans to cover any extra funding gaps. Learn more about how a student loan is different from a scholarship and other ways of paying for a higher education. Both federal and private student loans typically require repayment. Federal student loans let you start repayment six months after you leave school. Conversely, private student loans may require you to begin repayment while you\u2019re still in school. Scholarships are free aid, so they aren\u2019t meant to be repaid. In some cases, scholarships require recipients to maintain a certain GPA while in school, be part of a specific demographic group, and/or meet other eligibility criteria. Each scholarship has its own eligibility requirements and selection criteria. Because of this, it\u2019s important to read through the requirements before submitting an application. Some scholarships are awarded based on merit (i.e., grades and academics). These differ from grants, which are typically given out based on need. This isn\u2019t always the case for either type of financial aid, as need-based scholarships also exist, while some grants factor in a student\u2019s GPA. It\u2019s up to each entity funding a scholarship to determine what they require from applicants. Some federal student loans also require you to show financial need in order to qualify, such as direct subsidized loans. But neither direct subsidized nor direct unsubsidized loans require a credit check or co-signer, whereas many private student loans require one or both. Private lenders have minimum credit score requirements borrowers must meet to qualify for a student loan. If you don\u2019t have sufficient credit history to borrow on your own, you might need a co-signer\u2019s help. Parents often serve as co-signers for their dependent students, if they have strong enough credit to qualify. For scholarships, the exact application process will vary among each business, organization, nonprofit, individual, or other group offering them. Most applications are available online, making applying for and tracking awards easier. You can apply for federal student loans and all federal financial aid through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Any student can complete the FAFSA, regardless of income, and you\u2019ll be considered for federal scholarships, grants, student loans, and work-study programs. To complete the form, you must create a FSA ID. If you\u2019re a dependent student, a parent will also need their own FSA ID to complete their portion of the FAFSA. Some scholarships also require a completed FAFSA for eligibility. Private student lenders also often offer online applications, which makes it easy for borrowers to apply and receive results within minutes. Depending on where you complete your application, your money could come from the same source or from several different sources. You can get a scholarship from: The United States Department of Education funds federal student loans. Private lenders, including banks, credit unions, and online lenders, offer private student loans. You can use scholarships and student loans to pay for most of your education-related costs, including tuition, fees, room and board, books, transportation, food, and similar expenses. Some scholarships send money directly to your school, while others send checks to you directly. If you\u2019ve used all your scholarship money to pay for school-related expenses and have some left over, you might be able to use that money however you please. But some scholarships place restrictions on how you can use the awarded funds. Read through your scholarship conditions carefully to determine whether there are any guidelines on how you can (and can\u2019t) use your money. Both federal and private student loans let you use funds to pay for eligible school expenses. This is a broad category, since students have a wide range of costs. Aside from tuition, fees, supplies, books, and room and board, you can use your funds for many other expenses, including child care, off-campus housing, expenses to cover professional licenses and certification, disability needs, and more. There are some restrictions on student loan funds. For instance, you can\u2019t use them for debt repayment, illegal activities, vacations, and shopping that isn\u2019t a qualified education expense. Since scholarships are free, they aren\u2019t intended to be repaid. Student loans, however, are debt products with the expectation that you\u2019ll repay them. Federal student loans have repayment terms ranging from 10 years to over 30 years, depending on the repayment plan. Private student loans may have shorter repayment terms and don\u2019t base repayment on your discretionary income like federal student loans do. Monthly student loan payments could limit your ability to save for your future, whether that\u2019s for a big purchase, such as a car or home, or a long-term saving goal like expanding your family or retirement. You should try to get as much free money as possible to cover your college costs. If you have to borrow money, start with federal student loans. Your first choice should be direct subsidized loans, if you\u2019re eligible. Since the government covers the interest that accrues while you\u2019re in school, you\u2019ll pay less in the long run. If you have any funding gaps, move on to direct unsubsidized loans and parent PLUS loans. Private student loans should be a last resort if you still have funding gaps. The only impact scholarships have on your future financial aid is that all of your scholarships added together can\u2019t be greater than the total cost of attendance (COA) at your school. However, this is typically only for federally awarded scholarships. If you have private scholarships, you may not have to worry about any financial aid eligibility limitation. If you receive a scholarship and use it to pay for qualified educational expenses, it doesn\u2019t count as taxable income. However, scholarship funds may be considered taxable income in certain circumstances, such as if you have excess funding or if the scholarship is more of a stipend. For student loans, you can take a tax deduction on the student loan interest paid throughout the year. Scholarships and student loans are two possible sources of student aid you can receive to fund a higher education. Scholarships are the ideal form of funding, as they don\u2019t have to be paid back, typically only requiring you to maintain a specific GPA and/or meet some other eligibility criteria. However, many students won\u2019t be able to attend college on scholarships alone, which is where student loans come in. Whether federal or private, student loans generally have to be repaid, and private loans may require you or a co-signer to have a specific credit score or discretionary income.

            "content": "SDI Productions / Getty Images If you work for a government or not-for-profit organization and took out federal student loans while in college, you might qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Other types of federal loans, as well as private student loans, are ineligible for PSLF. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program is designed to relieve you of the burden of your direct student loan debt if you work for a government or not-for-profit organization. After you\u2019ve made 120 qualifying payments on your direct loans under an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan or the standard repayment plan while working full-time for an eligible employer, the remainder of your student debt will be forgiven. You\u2019ll need to meet specific eligibility criteria to qualify for PSLF, including: As long as you work for a qualifying employer, you\u2019re eligible for PSLF, regardless of what you do as part of your job. Before you can get PSLF, you'll need to ensure your loans are eligible for PSLF. Direct loans, including subsidized, unsubsidized, PLUS, and consolidation loans, are the only types of student loans that are eligible for PSLF. If you have any of these loans, check whether they\u2019re under a qualifying repayment plan. These are either the standard 10-year repayment plan or an IDR plan, including: Remember that while you\u2019re eligible for PSLF under the standard repayment plan, you might still need to be under an income-driven plan to benefit from PSLF. That's because if you have the standard repayment plan, your repayment schedule will fully repay your student loans after 10 years. PSLF doesn't kick in until after 120 qualifying monthly payments, which (assuming you don\u2019t miss any payments) would take a minimum of 10 years. On July 18, 2024, a federal appeals court blocked the SAVE plan until two court cases centered around the IDR plan can be resolved. The U.S. Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into an interest-free forbearance while the litigation is ongoing. It has also outlined options for borrowers who were nearing PSLF\u2014borrowers can either \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if they reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan. While direct loans qualify for PSLF, not all loans are eligible. If you took out private student loans to fund your higher education, these aren't eligible for forgiveness, as PSLF only forgives some federal student loans. At the federal level, some government-backed student loans also don't qualify for forgiveness, including: Non-direct federal loans may still be forgiven under PSLF if you first consolidate them into a direct consolidation loan. It can take years for your student loans to be forgiven, so if you want to get approved, you\u2019ll want to start making those qualifying monthly payments as soon as possible. Since not all loans are eligible for PSLF, it\u2019s important to confirm whether your student loans qualify before you apply. There\u2019s no limit to how much student loan debt gets forgiven under PSLF. After 120 qualifying payments, any remaining student loan debt will be forgiven. If you change jobs and end up working for a for-profit employer before finishing a PSLF application, your application could get denied. To remain eligible for PSLF, you must be working full-time for a qualifying employer while making the 120 qualifying payments, when you apply for loan forgiveness, and when you receive it. You don't have to consolidate your loans in order to qualify for PSLF, but if you want to move any non-direct federal loans into an IDR plan, you'll need to consolidate them first. PSLF can forgive several types of student loans, but not all of them. Some student loans, including private student loans and non-direct federal student loans, aren\u2019t eligible for PSLF. Knowing which student loans qualify for PSLF before completing an application can save you time and energy, which can be put toward devising a new repayment strategy for your ineligible loans.

            "title": "Are Parent PLUS Loans Eligible for Forgiveness?",
            "content": "Yes, in some cases, but the process is not always straightforward fstop123/Getty Images PLUS (Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students) loans are a type of federal student loan. Parents can apply for one to cover as much as the full cost of college for their children. If you have a Parent PLUS loan, here are your options for obtaining loan forgiveness. Parent PLUS loans must be consolidated into a Direct Consolidation loan to be considered for forgiveness. After that, several criteria will determine your eligibility for having some of the money you owe forgiven. As of the second quarter of 2024, there was $109.8 billion in outstanding Parent PLUS loan debt. The ICR and PSLF programs work differently. Here are the basic details: Parent PLUS loans are eligible for an ICR plan after they have been consolidated into Direct Consolidation Loans. ICR plans can lower your monthly payments and eventually lead to loan forgiveness. Payments are calculated as either what you would pay over a 12-year loan period or as no more than 20% of your discretionary income for the year. Under the ICR plan, your loan term will extend to 25 years. If you still owe money after that term ends, the remaining balance of the loan is forgiven. People who work for the government or certain nonprofit organizations may be able to seek Parent PLUS loan forgiveness through the PSFL Program. Eligible employers include: If your employer qualifies, your first step will be to consolidate your Direct PLUS loan into a Direct Consolidation loan. Then, you will need to apply for an ICR plan and begin making payments. Once you have made 120 monthly payments through a qualifying repayment plan, the remaining balance of your loan will be forgiven. Student loan forgiveness for Parent PLUS loans does have limitations and exceptions. Although there are a number of income-driven repayment (IDR) plans available for other federal student loan borrowers, Parent PLUS loans only qualify for the ICR program. (While that is the general rule, a possible loophole involving so-called SAVE plans recently came to light, as explained below.) Your employment is another factor to consider. You must work for an eligible employer to pursue loan forgiveness through the PSLF program. As mentioned, you must also consolidate your loan into a Direct Consolidation loan. If you don't, you must use the 10-year Standard Repayment plan or another plan in which you pay your balance in full. If loan forgiveness is not possible, Parent PLUS loan borrowers can explore other options that may make repayment more achievable: Parents who take out a Direct PLUS loan cannot transfer that loan to their child. If they wish to transfer the debt, their student must apply for a loan from a private lender, use that money to repay the original PLUS loan, and assume responsibility for the new loan going forward. Parent PLUS loan borrowers have to consolidate their loans with a federal Direct Consolidation loan to become eligible for an Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plan. Unless they then take additional steps (see next section for an example), the only IDR program they are eligible for is the Income Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan. Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plans are a type of IDR plan that can lower monthly payments. Parent PLUS loan borrowers may be eligible for this option, according to a number of sources, but it requires multiple steps. First, you need to have two or more federal loans. If you have two PLUS loans, you will need to consolidate each of them into a separate Direct Consolidation loan. Then, you have to consolidate those loans into a single Direct Consolidation loan by July 1, 2025. Once you have that single Direct Consolidation loan, you are eligible to apply for a SAVE plan. However, see the \"Important\" note immediately below. As of this writing, the Federal Student Aid website carries this note: \"On July 18, 2024, a Federal Court issued a stay preventing the Department of Education from operating the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan. We are assessing the ruling and will be in touch directly with borrowers about how this will affect them.\" Parents can apply to defer a PLUS loan, which results in a temporary pause in payment. Borrowers can qualify for deferment if their child is enrolled in college at least half-time or for another six months after the child is no longer enrolled at least half-time. If you defer payment, you will likely be responsible for the interest that accrues during that period. When you apply for a Parent PLUS loan, you are agreeing to shoulder some or all of the cost of your child's education. So it's important to weigh the benefits and risks of these loans. How could that debt impact your own financial goals and retirement plans? If you are struggling to repay a Parent PLUS loan, loan forgiveness may be possible. However, you will need to meet the eligibility requirements and take several steps to get there. Before you make any moves, it's a good idea to speak with your loan servicer about the process for consolidating your Parent PLUS loans and your likely eligibility for an ICR or a PSLF plan.

            "content": "SDI Productions / Getty Images Student loan consolidation can offer several unique benefits, although some perks vary based on the borrower\u2019s exact situation. Some types of student loan consolidation can result in a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, and long-term savings on student debt. However, in some other cases, consolidating student loans can lower the monthly payment but increase the cost of the loan in the long run. There are also differences between federal and private student loan consolidation, which is also called refinancing. This guide will break down the pros and cons of both types of consolidation for student loans and other details you should know. Student loan consolidation involves taking several different loans and combining them into a single loan with one monthly payment. However, the process is different for federal student loans when compared to loans from a private lender. Eligible federal student loans can be consolidated into another type of federal loan called a direct consolidation loan. Most types of federal student loans are eligible for being consolidated into a direct consolidation loan, and borrowers who take advantage of this option can change their repayment plan as part of the process. However, direct consolidation loans don't lead to interest savings because they use the weighted average of current loan interest rates (rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of 1%) to assign the new fixed interest rate. Most federal student loans, including direct consolidation loans, don\u2019t require a credit check. Private companies may also offer debt consolidation, which can apply to federal or private student loans. Also called refinancing, this process lets you combine all your current student loans into a new one with a new interest rate, monthly payment, and repayment term. While most federal student loans don\u2019t require a credit check, private student loans usually do. This means individuals with low credit scores or limited credit may not get approved unless they have a co-signer. Eligibility requirements for student loan consolidation depend on the type borrowers pursue: federal or private. Here's a rundown of the general requirements for each. Some benefits of student loan consolidation apply to both federal or private loans, whereas others are only applicable to one or the other. Student loan consolidation can help student loan borrowers simplify their financial lives by turning several loan payments into one. This can make paying bills and budgeting for student loans considerably easier and less stressful. Consolidating student loans can allow borrowers to qualify for a lower monthly payment, although this depends on the specific situation. Also note that getting a lower monthly payment often requires extending the repayment term, and this may lead to paying more in interest over the life of the loan. While borrowers who consolidate federal student loans with a direct consolidation loan won\u2019t benefit from a lower interest rate, those who consolidate with a private lender might. However, the best interest rates on private student loans are for borrowers with very good to excellent credit and high incomes. Borrowers with a co-signer who meets these criteria may also be able to qualify for these attractive rates and terms. Consolidating federal student loans with a direct consolidation loan can unlock access to various forgiveness options that might have otherwise been unavailable, such as income-driven repayment (IDR) plans or Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), per the United States Department of Education. There are also some potential downsides when you consolidate your existing student loans into a new one. Consider the following. First, you should know that consolidating federal student loans with a private lender means missing out on a range of federal benefits. These include federal deferment and forbearance options as well as access to federal student loan forgiveness programs. Alterations to your student loan payment or repayment term could lead to paying more interest in the long run. This is often the case when borrowers switch to a new repayment plan with a lower monthly payment and a longer repayment period. Also note that consolidating federal student loans with a direct consolidation loan means having outstanding interest on old loans added to the principal balance of the new loan. Unsurprisingly, this can further increase the amount of interest you\u2019ll end up having to pay. The impact to a borrower's credit score shouldn't be significant if they opt to refinance their student loans, but the final outcome will vary based on their circumstances. For the most part, making on-time payments on student loans is the best way to raise one's credit score over time. Consolidating federal student loans with a direct consolidation loan can also mean losing credit toward forgiveness programs. This can be a major setback for borrowers who\u2019ve diligently made their monthly loan payments in order to have them forgiven as soon as possible. The process for student loan consolidation depends on whether borrowers want to consolidate with a direct consolidation loan or with a private lender. Borrowers with eligible federal student loans can consolidate by filling out a direct consolidation loan application on the Federal Student Aid (FSA) website. Information required to apply includes: The exact process for consolidating private student loans (or federal loans with a private lender) varies between lenders. However, borrowers should start the process by comparing several private student loan companies based on their advertised interest rates and available repayment terms. Applying for private loan consolidation online may require the following information: Remember that private student loans generally require a credit check, and some lenders allow applicants to apply with a co-signer to get better loan terms. The new monthly payment you\u2019d have after consolidating your student loans will depend on the new repayment plan and interest rate, among other factors. Consolidating federal student loans with a direct consolidation loan can make them eligible for forgiveness through IDR plans or PSLF. However, each program has its own eligibility requirements you\u2019ll need to satisfy. The exact impact of a student loan consolidation on your credit score will vary. A hard inquiry on your credit report from a private lender could temporarily ding your credit, whereas federal loan consolidation won\u2019t require a credit check. Either way, so long as you make on-time payments on your newly consolidated student loan, your credit score will most likely improve over time. If you\u2019re comparing federal student loan consolidation and private student loan refinancing, then know that one isn\u2019t necessarily better than the other. The biggest thing to keep in mind is that refinancing would mean losing out on federal benefits (unless you\u2019re only refinancing private loans), but consolidation may mean paying more in interest in the long run. Consolidating student loans can make repayment simpler, and it can also result in a different student loan payment or repayment term. However, borrowers should crunch the numbers to determine what their interest savings might be if they consolidate, or whether they\u2019ll end up paying more in interest over the life of their loans. Also be aware that refinancing federal loans with a private lender means missing out on a range of federal loan protections most borrowers want to have. Before moving forward with consolidating your student debt, first consider the pros and cons of consolidation, specifically as they relate to your type of loan.

            "title": "What Is Discretionary Income on Student Loans?",
            "content": "juanma hache / Getty Images Discretionary income is the metric used to calculate how much a borrower will pay under an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. A borrower\u2019s discretionary income is based on a few different factors that gauge their overall financial situation, including their annual income and family size. Borrowers with higher incomes and smaller families can typically afford larger student loan payments based on this metric, whereas those with lower incomes, bigger families, or both can qualify for lower monthly payments. Required payments on income-driven plans can even be as low as $0 for borrowers with limited discretionary income, per the U.S. Department of Education. Read on for more information on how discretionary income on student loans works, how it applies to different IDR plans, and other details you should know. Discretionary income typically refers to the money you have left over after you pay your taxes and other necessary expenses. With federal student loans, this metric is used to determine the monthly payments due under an IDR plan. These plans base a borrower\u2019s discretionary income on the difference between their income and a percentage of the federal poverty guideline (based on family size and state of residence). Tax filing status can also affect the discretionary income calculation. The exact percentage of the federal poverty guideline used to calculate a borrower\u2019s discretionary income varies among IDR plans. Borrowers using the standard, 10-year repayment plan don't need to worry about discretionary income (in this context). Under this plan, monthly payments are based on how much is owed and the fixed interest rate that applies. Discretionary income only matters for IDR plans and loans repaid through the federal loan rehabilitation program,\u00a0Fresh Start, for borrowers in default. The chart below shows how discretionary income is calculated for an IDR plan. On July 18, 2024, a federal appeals court blocked the SAVE plan until two court cases centered around the IDR plan can be resolved. The Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into an interest-free forbearance while the litigation is ongoing. It has also outlined options for borrowers who were nearing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)\u2014borrowers can either \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if they reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan. Loan rehabilitation helps borrowers get their federal student loans out of default, and it requires a certain number of consecutive, on-time payments on student loans under a rehabilitation agreement. In the context of loan rehabilitation, a borrower\u2019s discretionary income is based on the difference between their annual income and 150% of the poverty guideline for their family size and state of residence. From there, the actual monthly payment made is based on the IDR plan utilized by the borrower. Note that through Sept. 30, 2024, loan rehabilitation has been replaced with the Fresh Start program. However, the same terms regarding discretionary income and getting on an IDR plan apply. While borrowers with federal student loans may not be able to help their income or family size, there are strategies they can use to manage their discretionary income and keep their student loan payments as low as possible. Consider the following tips to reduce the burden of student debt. First, make sure you select the right IDR plan for your needs\u2014one that comes with the lowest possible monthly payment you can get and a repayment term that makes sense for your goals. Choosing the right IDR plan is important because loan amounts left at the end of these plans are ultimately forgiven. Thus, having the lowest possible monthly payment you can get is paramount, even if you have to pay off student debt for 20 or 25 years. Start using a written monthly budget to account for student loan payments, rent or mortgage payments, transportation costs, utilities, and other expenses you may have. You could also look into budgeting apps, which help you manage your income and bills on your smartphone. Several specific budgeting strategies, like zero-sum budgeting or the 50/30/20 budgeting strategy, could also help you manage your money. Also note that your \"annual income\" for the purpose of determining discretionary income is the adjusted gross income (AGI) listed when you file your taxes. You could potentially reduce your AGI through a range of different moves, including making contributions to a tax-advantaged retirement plan like a 401(k) or a health savings account (HSA). In addition to lowering your AGI, there are other benefits to investing more for retirement or saving money in an HSA. These include having more funds available when you retire, having extra money set aside to cover health care expenses as they occur, and greater overall financial security. The 50/30/20 rule is a budgeting strategy that asks consumers to allocate 50% of their income toward needs and essential expenses, 30% toward wants, and 20% toward savings each month. The impacts of managing discretionary income depend on the strategy being used. For example, making contributions to a retirement plan like a 401(k) or an HSA to lower one's AGI\u00a0 will inevitably lead to more savings and greater wealth over time, whereas being selective on IDR plans for federal student loans can help consumers save money on their debt payments in the long run. Several discretionary income calculators for federal student loans can be found online, including one from Omni. In the context of federal student loans, discretionary income is based on how much you earn each year and your family size, tax filing status, and state of residence. This metric is compared to the poverty guideline level and is used by the Department of Education to determine how much student debt you can afford to repay each month.

            "title": "Does Tuition Reimbursement Cover Student Loans?",
            "content": "FatCamera / Getty Images With tuition reimbursement programs, companies help their workers earn a degree or finish one they already started for free\u2014or for a lower cost than they would pay without the reimbursement benefit. Current law lets employers use tuition reimbursement programs to cover student loan bills, but only through 2025. Learn more about how tuition reimbursement can cover student loan payments and other details on how these programs work below. Tuition reimbursement programs are offered by employers as part of their package of benefits. The requirements for these programs tend to vary by employer. For example, a worker may need to be employed by a firm for a number of years to qualify, or they may have to agree to a certain length of employment after they graduate from college. Current law allows tax-free benefits under tuition assistance programs in amounts up to $5,250 per employee each year. This means workers who take advantage of this benefit can receive up to $5,250 per year in tuition reimbursement without having to count amounts received in their taxable income. However, tuition reimbursement over that amount is considered taxable income. While these programs are typically limited to college tuition, fees, and other expenses, employers can now put the funds toward their employees\u2019 student loan principal and interest payments through Dec. 31, 2025. This benefit is tax-free for the employee, as if the money was being used for traditional tuition reimbursement, and employers receive tax benefits on their end as well. Tuition reimbursement programs help employees learn new skills and excel in their careers with higher education. After all, these programs can provide workers with the funds they need to finish a college degree or pursue an MBA or other graduate-level degree. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also notes that, in a tight labor market, employers who offer this benefit may get a leg up when it comes to attracting and retaining highly qualified employees. These programs can also help workers borrow less for college, thus lowering the amount of student loan interest they\u2019ll pay over the life of their debt. Through the end of 2025, employers can direct up to $5,250 toward each of their workers\u2019 student loan debt payments as part of their compensation. According to the IRS, tuition reimbursement programs offered through employers provide funding for typical educational expenses like college tuition, fees, books, equipment, and supplies. However, employers can also use these programs to pay their employees\u2019 student loans through the end of 2025. Note that, in either case, the amount of tax-free benefits employers can provide is limited to $5,250 per employee, per year. Some employers require workers to remain employed at the company for a certain period of time as a condition of tuition reimbursement. If an employee leaves before they agreed to, they\u2019re required to pay back the benefit amount received. Getting reimbursement for college tuition typically doesn\u2019t disqualify you from receiving other types of financial aid for college. You can apply for aid as you normally would and receive scholarships, grants, and access to federal student loans. Tuition reimbursement programs pay you back for tuition, fees, and other qualified higher education expenses after the fact. Some programs will send the payments directly to your college or university instead. Students who plan to take advantage of tuition reimbursement programs should still fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to find out what other types of aid they may be eligible for. Companies known for paying college tuition include major corporations like Amazon, Boeing, Chipotle, Discover, and Disney. Some of these companies offer tuition reimbursement programs, whereas others like Starbucks offer fully funded degree programs for their employees. Tuition reimbursement programs can be valuable for both employers and employees, though only for amounts of up to $5,250 per employee each year. They help companies attract and retain talented workers, all while helping employees reach their full potential through higher education. Furthermore, these programs can be used to repay student loan principal and interest through the end of 2025. This benefit can be useful for employees who don't need to pursue higher education any longer but still have lingering student debt to pay off.

            "title": "Are Student Loans Subject to Compound or Simple Interest?",
            "content": "SDI Productions / Getty Images When it comes time to repay your student loans, part of your monthly payment will go to your principal balance, or the amount you took out to pay for school. Another part will go toward your interest, or what you pay the lender for giving you a loan. You could have simple or compound interest, depending on which type of student loan you took out. Simple interest is calculated based on a loan\u2019s principal balance and doesn\u2019t compound. The United States Department of Education uses the following simple daily interest formula to calculate interest charges on a federal student loan: Outstanding Principal Balance * Interest Rate Factor * Number of Days Since Last Payment Simple daily interest is similar to simple interest, with the major difference being that the interest charged is based on the actual principal balance each day. Let\u2019s say you borrowed $20,000 at a 5% simple interest rate with the standard 10-year repayment plan. To determine the interest rate factor, divide the interest rate by the number of days in a year, which gives us 0.0136% (0.05 / 365 = 0.000136). Next, in order to determine how much interest is charged each day, multiply the interest rate factor by the original loan principal. This gives us a daily interest charge of $2.72 ($20,000 * 0.000136). Finally, multiply the interest rate factor by the number of days in the monthly billing cycle (we\u2019ll assume it\u2019s 30 days), which gives us $81.60 ($2.72 * 30). This is the amount of interest you\u2019d pay for the month. Compound interest accrues on both a loan\u2019s initial principal balance as well as the interest accumulated from previous payment periods. Interest can compound annually, monthly, daily, etc., and the number of compounding periods will determine how much compound interest will be charged. Here\u2019s how compound interest is calculated on the same $20,000 loan from earlier. For this example, we\u2019ll assume interest is compounded daily. On the first day of the loan, the daily interest charge is calculated by multiplying the principal balance by the interest rate factor, which gives us $2.72 ($20,000 * 0.000136). Your outstanding balance on the first day then becomes $20,002.72. On the second day, you\u2019ll multiply the new principal balance by the same interest rate factor, which gives us approximately $2.7204 ($20,002.72 * 0.000136). On the third day, your new balance will be $20,005.44. By the time your first monthly payment is due, the loan will have accrued $83.50 in interest. You\u2019ll typically pay more in interest with compound interest student loans compared to simple interest ones. Interest capitalization refers to unpaid interest being added to a loan\u2019s principal balance. Because capitalized interest becomes part of the principal, future interest will be charged on the new, larger amount. Capitalization can occur under the following circumstances, depending on the type of loan: You might also face capitalization under an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. If your monthly payments are less than the amount of interest that accrues each month, the difference will be added to the principal balance. Both subsidized and unsubsidized loans use simple daily interest. For subsidized loans, the federal government covers your interest payments while you\u2019re in school. For unsubsidized loans, you\u2019re responsible for the interest that accrues during that time, even though you\u2019re not required to pay until six months after you graduate. There\u2019s no compounding standard among private student loans. Interest rates on some private loans compound daily, while others compound monthly. Some might even use simple interest instead of compound interest. It\u2019s up to each lender to decide what kind of interest rate they want to use. Before taking out a new loan, be sure to check whether the lender uses a simple interest rate or a compound one so you know what you\u2019re on the hook for when it comes time to repay. Interest capitalization can significantly increase how much it\u2019ll ultimately cost to repay your student loan debt. It\u2019ll increase your total principal balance, which in turn increases your minimum monthly payment. If you don\u2019t plan accordingly, you might not be able to afford your monthly payments, which puts you at risk of falling behind. Missing payments causes your credit score to drop, which hurts your chances of borrowing in the future, whether that\u2019s for a credit card, an auto loan, or a mortgage. The U.S. Department of Education uses simple daily interest to calculate how much interest accrues each day on a student loan, while private lenders use whichever type of interest they prefer. If your lender prefers compound interest, then you\u2019ll likely end up paying more in interest over the life of your loan than you would with a simple interest rate.

            "content": "Milan Markovic / Getty Images Parent PLUS loan balances won't transfer to other family members if the parent passes away while still owing money. If a parent who borrows for college with a Parent PLUS loan dies, any remaining loan balances owed will be discharged. The same is true if the student passes away during the repayment period, per the United States Department of Education. Parent PLUS loans are federal student loans that are taken out by parents (biological or adoptive) instead of by the student. These student loans come with higher loan limits than other types of federal student loans, but they also have higher interest rates. Parent PLUS loans are for parents of students who are pursuing higher education, so they have different requirements, interest rates, and repayment options. For example, these loans have higher borrowing limits than most other federal student loans. In fact, parents can borrow up to the cost of attendance (COA) for the school the child attends, minus any other financial assistance received. These loans also have higher interest rates than other federal student loans, and parent borrowers need to pass a credit check to qualify. Because these loans tend to be more costly and less flexible than federal student loans geared toward student borrowers, they\u2019re primarily meant for filling in funding gaps after students have exhausted all other forms of aid. Forgiveness for Parent PLUS loans is a complicated process, but some forgiveness options are available. Parent PLUS loans can qualify for student loan forgiveness due to death in two separate scenarios: Families who need to apply for student loan discharge due to death can do so by contacting the loan servicer in charge of the loans and inquiring about next steps. Typically, they\u2019ll need to provide documentation of the borrower or parent's death, which can include an original death certificate, a certified copy of a death certificate, or a complete photocopy of either document. The tax implications of student loan discharge due to death are somewhat ambiguous at the moment, at least until after 2025. Essentially, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made it so student loan debt forgiven through discharge due to death or permanent disability doesn\u2019t count toward gross income through the end of that year. Income taxes aren\u2019t due on discharged loan amounts through the end of 2025. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expires at the end of 2025 if not renewed. For a Parent PLUS loan, the discharge process for students who pass away is the same as if the parent had passed away. Affected families need to reach out to the loan servicer to inquire about next steps, which will include providing a death certificate or similar documentation. All federal student loans are eligible for discharge due to death. A similar type of discharge can also occur when a borrower becomes totally and permanently disabled. Ordinarily, discharged debt is considered taxable income by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). As such, if a student loan borrower died before repaying their debt, the administrator of their estate would be responsible for paying the taxes on the forgiven amount, potentially using assets that would\u2019ve gone to the deceased\u2019s family. However, through the end of 2025, loan balances discharged due to death aren\u2019t considered taxable income. This could change after 2025 if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act isn\u2019t renewed. Federal student loans are forgiven if the student passes away, and this is just as true for parents who borrow for college with Parent PLUS loans. For the most part, qualifying for this discharge only requires families to submit acceptable proof of death. This type of discharge is also free of major tax consequences through the end of 2025, thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. However, this piece of legislation is set to expire at the end of that year, so it\u2019s uncertain how discharges will be treated for tax purposes thereafter.

            "content": "You might need to consolidate your Stafford loans to qualify for forgiveness If you have Stafford loans, then certain types of student loan forgiveness may only be available for you if consolidate said loans under the newer William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program. Review your options for student loan forgiveness to determine whether your Stafford loans are eligible. Stafford loans were part of the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, which ended in 2010. The Federal Direct Loan Program replaced the FFEL program, and no new Stafford loans have been issued since July 2010. However, some people might still refer to direct loans as Stafford loans, even though they aren't part of the current program. Similar to today's direct loans, there were two types of Stafford loans: Some people and schools also informally refer to subsidized and unsubsidized direct loans as Stafford loans. New federal student loans made today, whether subsidized or unsubsidized, aren't Stafford loans. Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) is a debt cancellation program that requires borrowers to make 120 qualifying payments while working full-time for an eligible nonprofit or government agency, after which their remaining federal student loan balance is forgiven. If you have Stafford loans, they're ineligible for PSLF unless you consolidate them into a direct consolidation loan first. Teacher Loan Forgiveness can result in forgiveness of up to $17,500, so long as your Stafford loans were issued after Oct. 1, 1998. You must teach for five consecutive academic years and be considered highly qualified. It's important to note that you can't be working toward both PSLF and Teacher Loan Forgiveness at the same time. If you pursue Teacher Loan Forgiveness, the qualifying payments for PSLF won't start until after you finish the required five-year period of academic service. There are additional forgiveness programs available for borrowers in certain professions or who meet other criteria. For example, you might be eligible for forgiveness under the NHSC Students to Service Loan Repayment Program if you work in a health care profession as a nurse, doctor, dentist, or other provider in a designated Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA). However, because you're required to be in school full-time during the application year, getting old Stafford loans forgiven might not be possible. There are various forgiveness and discharge programs for military members, lawyers, etc., though many are only available for direct loans. You may also be able to qualify for a debt discharge if your school defrauded you or if you become permanently disabled. Finally, you might be eligible for forgiveness using an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan after 20 or 25 years of qualifying payments. However, Stafford loans issued under the FFEL program aren't eligible for IDR plans unless you consolidate them into direct loans. Yes, if your employer meets the eligibility criteria of being a 501(c)(3) nonprofit or a government agency, your Stafford loan might be eligible for forgiveness under PSLF (if you first consolidate your Stafford loans into a direct consolidation loan). Check with your state to determine what forgiveness programs it currently offers. Additionally, if you're on an IDR plan, you can receive forgiveness after 20 or 25 years of qualifying payments, depending on the plan. You must consolidate your Stafford loans into a direct consolidation loan first in order to benefit from an IDR plan. Under current tax law, student loans discharged by Jan. 1, 2026, won't be considered taxable income at the federal level. This includes forgiven Stafford loans. However, state taxes might still be levied on the amount forgiven. After January 2026, only debts forgiven under PSLF are exempt from federal income tax. Even though new Stafford loans are no longer available, some borrowers are still making payments on the federal student loans they took out before 2010. If you're one such borrower, review your options to determine whether consolidating your Stafford loans to access more federal forgiveness programs would make sense for your financial situation.

            "content": "Most private student loans aren't eligible for forgiveness Tom Werner / Getty Images Private student loans are usually only forgiven when the borrower becomes permanently disabled or dies\u2014sometimes not even then. While there are several options for federal student loan cancellation and forgiveness, private programs for cancellation are less common. Learn more about your options for private student loan forgiveness. The United States government backs federal student loans and has approved servicers to handle the logistics of repayment. Banks, credit unions, and other lenders are responsible for all aspects of private student loans. Federal student loans don't require a credit check, and the interest rate is the same for every borrower, based on a formula set by Congress. Additionally, you can borrow the same amount, regardless of your credit situation. By contrast, private student loans vary based on your credit situation, income, and other factors. Private lenders set their own terms, and their terms aren't standardized like with federal student loans. This includes origination and repayment, in addition to whether debt cancellation is available. In most cases, private student loans aren't eligible for forgiveness. Private borrowers won't be eligible for federal forgiveness programs, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), or income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. Some of the best private student loan lenders might offer hardship programs for repayment, or you might be able to have your loan balance discharged in extenuating circumstances. Private student loan forgiveness is possible in very narrow circumstances. For example, some lenders will allow for debt cancellation in the event of total and permanent disability. Other lenders only forgive a loan balance if the borrower dies. In some cases, the co-signer or a spouse becomes responsible for a disabled or deceased borrower's private student loan debt, even in extreme circumstances. Some private student lenders will discharge your student debt if your school was involved in misconduct. This is similar to the U.S. government canceling federal student loan debt for borrowers who attended failed schools. Student loans can be complicated and confusing, especially if you have private loans. Here are some common misconceptions: You might be able to settle your private student debt for less than you owe. Talk to your lender about what programs it offers and set up a payment plan that's more likely to work for your budget. If your lender knows that you'll pay something, even if you can't afford the entire balance, it's more likely to work with you to reduce the total amount you'd pay through debt settlement. While difficult, it's not impossible to discharge some or all of your private student loan debt through bankruptcy. You need to determine whether Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy makes more sense for you, and you'll have to file an adversary proceeding for whichever one you choose. With Chapter 7 bankruptcy, you must pass a means test to show you can't afford to repay your student loan debt. With Chapter 13, you might be able to set up a payment plan that'll result in repaying much less than you owe. If you are having trouble paying down your student loan debt, refinancing your loans may help. If you can get a lower interest rate or a longer repayment term with a new student loan, you can reduce your monthly payment amount. Keep in mind that when you extend the term of the loan, you will most likely pay more in interest in the long run. Additionally, if you refinance federal student loans into a private student loan, you'll lose some of the benefits you'd have with the former, such as eligibility for student loan forgiveness programs. Yes, you can refinance private student loans to make payments more manageable. A loan with a lower interest rate or longer term can reduce your monthly payment amount. You'll have to speak with your lender about what its refinancing requirements are. Private student loans can be discharged at the discretion of the lender. Check with your lender to see whether your loan can be discharged in the event of death, disability, or fraud by your school. In some cases, your credit score might be affected based on how the lender reports modification to the credit bureaus. Additionally, forgiveness that results in having your loan paid off can impact your credit mix and history. Private student loan forgiveness is rare, so it's important to be open to alternative solutions if you're unable to repay your debt. If you're struggling with private student loans, contact your lender to determine whether debt cancellation is possible and, if not, what other options are available for you.

            "title": "Are Parent PLUS Loans Forgiven After 10 Years?",
            "content": "Sturti / Getty Images While a range of federal student loans are available directly for students, parent PLUS loans are more geared toward parents (biological or adoptive) of students pursuing a higher education. While most student loan forgiveness programs are only available for direct student loans, there's a workaround that allows some parent PLUS loans to be forgiven after 10 years. Read on to learn how this process works for your student loans and what steps parents can take to qualify. Parent PLUS loans are a type of federal student loan that\u2019s geared toward the biological or adoptive parents of students pursuing a higher education. These direct PLUS loans are unique from federal student loans taken out by students themselves in a few different ways, including the fact they require a credit check for approval. The borrowing limit on parent PLUS loans is also significantly higher than the loan limit on other types of federal student loans. In fact, the maximum amount parents can borrow is \"the cost of attendance at the school your child will attend minus any other financial assistance your child receives,\" according to the Federal Student Aid. However, parent PLUS loans have higher interest rates and more stringent terms than most other types of federal student loans. For example, parent PLUS loans never have subsidized interest, whereas some direct loans to students do. Parent PLUS loans are meant for filling in funding gaps after you have exhausted other federal student aid. There are several types of student loan forgiveness available, including Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for those who work in public service positions and Teacher Loan Forgiveness (TLF). A range of income-driven repayment (IDR) plans also lead to total loan forgiveness after 20 to 25 years of payments made under these plans. PSLF is one of the more popular student loan forgiveness plans for federal student loans, as it leads to forgiveness after 10 years of on-time payments on an IDR plan. This forgiveness program is also available for workers across a wide range of industries that provide a direct benefit to the general public. While the vast majority of forgiveness programs for federal student loans are for students and not parents, there's a workaround that can allow parents to get their parent PLUS loan balances forgiven after 10 years of payments. It's important to note that forgiveness of parent PLUS loans through PSLF is based on the parent being employed in a public service position, not the student. Additionally, parents are ineligible for most IDR plans that would qualify for this program, with the exception of the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan. Parents who want to have their parent PLUS loans forgiven through PSLF may be able to do so by taking the following steps: Remaining parent PLUS loan amounts forgiven through PSLF aren\u2019t considered taxable income by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This means you won\u2019t be taxed by the federal government, but your state may still tax you. No. Parent PLUS loans can only be forgiven through PSLF if the parent, instead of the student, is working in a public service position. The interest rate for a direct consolidation loan is based on a weighted average of the existing loans being consolidated. Thus, there will be no notable change in the rate charged during repayment. However, switching to the ICR plan to qualify for PSLF will result in a different monthly payment, which is based on the lesser of 20% of your discretionary income or how much you would pay with a fixed payment over 12 years, adjusted according to your income. While most forgiveness plans are intended for student borrowers and not parents, it's definitely possible to have parent PLUS loan balances forgiven after 10 years. The borrowing parent must work in a public service position for this to be possible, and they\u2019ll also have to consolidate their parent PLUS loans into a direct consolidation loan and then make payments under an ICR plan for 10 years. PLUS loans also can be discharged if either the student or the parent passes away.

            "title": "Are Student Loans Considered Income?",
            "content": "In most cases you don't have to report your student loans to the IRS Tom Werner / Getty Images Student loans aren't considered as taxable income by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Because your student loans come in a lump sum that feels like \"getting\" money, you might think that you're required to report them on your tax return. But, like with any loan, this funding isn't considered income for tax purposes. Let's take a closer look at student loans and taxes. The amount you receive in student loans isn't considered taxable income. The IRS doesn't generally require you to report the money you receive for student loans on your income tax return, so you won't have to pay taxes on these funds. However, some types of financial aid, such as scholarships or grant money that goes toward living expenses in addition to tuition and fees, might be considered taxable income. If you have a student loan, you might be able to claim a tax deduction based on the amount of interest paid. For those who qualify for the student loan tax deduction, you might be able to reduce your taxable income by up to $2,500. You can also claim education credits to help you reduce the amount of tax you owe through the Lifetime Learning Credit or the American Opportunity Credit. These tax credits can help you offset the cost of tuition, fees, and other required costs of attending school. A lender will want to verify your income when you take out loan, especially a mortgage. One measure they use is the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. Your DTI considers your monthly debt payments (including student loans) compared to your income. If you have a lot of student loan debt, your DTI might be higher, making it harder to qualify for a loan. Getting on an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan might help you lower your monthly payments, reducing the impact of student loans on income verification for other debt. To remain on an IDR plan, however, you'll need to recertify your income each year to confirm that you still qualify. In general, the IRS considers canceled or forgiven debt as income. Once that debt is canceled, the IRS considers that you received it and didn't have to pay it back, so it's counted as part of your income. However, with student loans, there are a couple different scenarios. If you meet the requirements for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), your remaining balance won't be considered income by the IRS. As such, you won't have to worry about paying federal taxes on the canceled balance. However, some states do levy taxes on forgiven student loan debt. Most IDR plans will cancel your balance if you're still making payments after 20 or 25 years. However, the IRS generally considers this forgiven debt as taxable income. However, through Jan. 1, 2026, canceled IDR balances don't have to be reported as income on your federal income tax return. As with PSLF, some states will still tax you for the amount canceled through IDR forgiveness. A tax professional can help you determine if you need to pay taxes on forgiven debt. Other than PSLF, most types of student loan forgiveness are taxed as income at the federal level. Depending on the state you're in, student loan forgiveness, including PSLF cancelation, might be considered taxable income. In general, receiving student loans won't impact your eligibility for other financial aid. You're usually offered other types of aid, such as scholarships and grants, before being offered student loans to cover any remaining expenses. As long as you meet the income requirements and you've paid interest on a qualified student loan, you might be eligible to claim a tax deduction of up to $2,500. Are student loans considered income? For the most part, you don't have to worry about reporting the amount you receive in student loans to the IRS. However, your student loan debt can impact your ability to get other loans later. Additionally, if you have a portion of your student loan balances forgiven, you might have to pay federal or state taxes, depending on your loan type and where you live.

            "content": "Pay your student loan on time to improve your credit score Tara Moore / GettyImages Your credit score is based on information reported in your credit history. And, as a type of debt, student loans are included in your credit report. Your student loans can influence your credit score, so it's important to manage your student debt as you manage your overall credit. Fortunately, many of the same ways you would improve your credit score with non-student loans, such as making on-time payments and diversifying your credit mix, still apply. Information in your credit report\u2014including student loans\u2014is used to create a credit score. FICO scores are the most commonly used type of credit score, so understanding how your credit report translates into scoring can help you make better decisions. Five main factors are considered when calculating your FICO score: The most significant way that student loan debt can impact your credit score is through your payment history. If you make your payments on time, that reliability will show on your credit report and can be a boon for your credit score. However, payment history is a major part of your credit score, so defaulting on your student loans can have a major negative impact. Your student loans can also help positively impact the portion of your score that deals with your credit mix. Your student loans are installment loans, so they are considered a different type of debt than credit cards, for example. If you keep up with your both credit card and student loan payments, lenders see that you can responsibly handle different types of credit. Finally, because student loans often have longer terms, they can also influence the portion of your score that reflects your credit history. If you have student loan debt, there are some steps you can take to improve your credit score. Making on-time payments is one of the most important things you can do for your credit score. When you pay on time and the full amount required each month, you build a positive credit history and avoid the negative hit to your score from missing payments. You can make your student loans more manageable and potentially lower your monthly payments by consolidating or refinancing them. It's important to understand the differences between consolidation and refinancing so you can choose the best strategy for your needs: In both cases, the longer repayment term leads to a lower monthly payment that you're more likely to be able to afford, reducing the risk of missing a payment and hurting your credit score. A lower interest rate can also lower your total interest costs. If you're not sure you can consistently make student loan payments, even after you've consolidated your loans, you may want to consider an IDR plan. These repayment plans apply only to federal loans and are based on your discretionary income. You can build a positive credit history while you have student loan debt. Start by: If you're eligible for a forgiveness plan like Public Service Loan Forgiveness, consolidating your federal loans and getting on an IDR plan can help you maintain your credit score until your balance is forgiven. Once forgiven, your original loans will remain on your credit history, but they will be reported as paid in full. Private student loans might be a little trickier, as there's no forgiveness program. If you're concerned about making payments, consider contacting your lender about hardship programs, such as deferral and forbearance. Getting into a hardship program can help you avoid the credit score consequences that come with missing payments. Federal student loan servicers won't report delinquency to the major credit bureaus until you're at least 90 days behind on your payments. After 270 days, your loans go into default. This can have a greater negative impact on your credit score. Additionally, if you're in default on your federal student loans, you're not eligible for further student aid. You also can't get onto an IDR plan or take advantage of forgiveness, deferral, or forbearance. If you're in default, contact your student loan servicer about bringing your account back into good standing. There are different payment plans available that are designed to help you rehabilitate your defaulted student debt. Once you're no longer in default, you can use other strategies to make sure you can afford your payments and begin rebuilding your credit score. You can also use the federal Fresh Start program. If you enroll in this program, the default can be removed from your credit report immediately, resulting in a potential credit score improvement. Your payment history is part of your credit report and is included in credit score calculations. If you miss payments, that information is reported to the credit bureaus and can lower your credit score. If you're struggling to make your payments in full, consolidation or refinancing might help you secure a longer repayment term. With a longer repayment term, your monthly payment will decrease, making it easier to meet your obligation and miss fewer payments. Getting a lower interest rate can save you money in interest over the long term. If you default on a loan, you'll likely see a big decline in your credit score due to a poor payment history. Additionally, if you default on federal student loans, you'll be ineligible for certain federal benefits, repayment plans, and future student aid until you rehabilitate your loans. As a type of debt, student loans are included in your credit report and can impact your credit score. Because missed payments are likely to be especially detrimental to your credit score, consider using strategies like IDR and consolidation to reduce your monthly payment, making it more manageable so you can remain in good standing.

            "content": "SDI Productions / Getty Images Whether or not you should consolidate your student loans depends on several factors, including whether you have federal student loans, private loans, or a combination of the two. You can consolidate federal student loans while maintaining federal loan protections. But you can also consolidate or refinance any type of student loan with a private lender. Federal loan consolidation with a direct consolidation loan won't change the borrower's long-term interest rates. However, consolidation with a private lender could. Learn about the advantages and disadvantages to consider when deciding whether to consolidate your student loans. If you have federal student loans, you can consolidate them with a direct consolidation loan, which is a type of federal loan that combines several eligible loans into a new loan amount. While direct consolidation loans help you combine several federal loans into one that may have a lower monthly payment, these loans use the weighted average of a borrower\u2019s current loan interest rates (rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of 1%) to come up with their new rates. This means direct consolidation loans don't lead to lower interest costs for borrowers\u2014even if interest rates for new student loans have dropped since the original federal loans were taken out. Most types of federal student loans\u2014including direct loans and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans\u2014are eligible for consolidation, and there\u2019s no fee to consolidate into a direct consolidation loan. Private student loan consolidation, also called student loan refinancing, can apply to federal student loans, private student loans, or both. Borrowers can compare several student loan companies to find a new loan with a rate and term that works best for them, and they can move all their current student loans to the new one and begin making payments. Private student loans can have fixed or variable interest rates, and repayment terms vary. However, private student loans give you the potential to qualify for lower interest rates if market conditions change and broader interest rates drop. Of course, only people with good to excellent credit and sufficient income can qualify for the best student loan refinancing rates. If you refinance federal student loans with a private lender, you give up certain benefits and protections like deferment and forbearance, access to federal student loan forgiveness plans, and access to income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. Consolidating a student loan has several potential upsides, but this strategy also has downsides to consider. Potential for a lower interest rate Potential for a lower monthly payment Flexible repayment plans Credit and income requirements apply May need a co-signer Loss of federal student loan benefits When it comes to federal student loan consolidation with a direct consolidation loan, you can't consolidate this type of loan more than once unless you're adding another eligible loan to the mix. However, private student loans may be refinanced multiple times as long as you can qualify. Direct consolidation loans are eligible for various student loan forgiveness plans, including forgiveness through IDR plans or Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). The terms \"consolidation\" and \"refinance\" are used interchangeably and essentially mean the same thing, although consolidation generally refers to moving multiple loans into one loan. Refinancing can apply to moving either a single loan or multiple loans into a new loan. With a consolidation or a refinance, you will have a new monthly payment, interest rate, and repayment plan. Student loan consolidation rates for private loans vary throughout the year and change often based on market conditions. Rates on direct consolidation loans vary by borrower since they\u2019re based on the weighted average of existing loan interest rates (rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of 1%). Carefully consider whether you should consolidate your student loans, and fully understand the benefits and downsides. Potential advantages of refinancing include getting a lower monthly payment or potential interest savings with a private lender. However, you may have to give up federal student loan benefits.

            "title": "Why Are Student Loan Interest Rates So High?",
            "content": "mapodile / Getty Images Student loan interest rates are particularly high right now, with the rates on federal undergraduate loans reaching a near-record high of 6.53%. There are several factors contributing to this. While some of these are specific to either federal or private student loans, one factor affecting both loan types is volatile market conditions. Learn more about why student loan rates are so high and the factors that contribute to high interest rates. In order to fully unpack why student loan interest rates are so high, it\u2019s important to first understand the differences between federal and private student loans. While interest rates on private student loans can change frequently and vary widely, the following rates are fixed for federal student loans disbursed after July 1, 2024, and before July 1, 2025. We mentioned that Congress sets interest rates on federal student loans using rates on 10-year Treasury notes as a guideline, but how are those rates set? The government sets rates for 10-year Treasury notes based on the current economic landscape and global market conditions, but rates are also partially set using a bidding system. When market conditions are unreliable and investors are looking for a safe place to store their money, rates for 10-year Treasury notes tend to increase. Meanwhile, these same rates tend to decrease when markets are less volatile and demand slows down. Due to the passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965, interest rates are set each spring for new direct loans being made for the upcoming award year (from July 1 to the following June 30). Private student loan rates are also set based on market conditions, and they can be variable or fixed. The interest rates on private student loans depend on the lender and loan details, including loan amount, repayment term, and the borrower's income and credit score. In contrast to private student loans, most federal student loans don\u2019t require a credit check and offer the same fixed interest rates to all borrowers regardless of their financial situation. Interest rates are higher compared to several years ago for nearly any type of loan, from auto loans to mortgages. Rising interest rates are directly correlated to Federal Reserve increases in the federal funds rate, which is the rate banks pay one another when they borrow money. While the Fed has raised and lowered the federal funds rate regularly over time, 11 separate rate increases took place throughout 2022 and 2023 in response to market conditions and heightened inflation in the United States. Private student loan rates may be higher or lower than rates on federal student loans. It depends on the rates being offered by private lenders, a borrower's income and credit score, and the loan terms. Current rates on direct PLUS loans for parents and graduate and professional students are set at 9.08%, compared to the 6.53% rate that applies to direct subsidized loans and direct unsubsidized loans for undergraduate students. Private student lenders require applicants to pass a credit check to be approved, and they set rates based on creditworthiness and income. Individuals with good or excellent credit (or a qualified co-signer) can qualify for lower interest rates, whereas those with less-than-stellar credit typically pay higher interest rates. You can pay off your student loans faster by refinancing to a new loan with a shorter repayment term, making additional payments toward the principal, or both. Student loan interest rates are so high right now compared to just a few years ago, similar to mortgage loans, auto loans, personal loans, and other types of commercial lending. This is especially troubling for federal student loans, as they're fixed for the loan duration, and refinancing with a private lender to hopefully secure a lower rate would mean losing out on several federal protections and benefits. Ultimately, students should borrow with a plan in mind regardless of interest rates. It may make more sense to refinance student loans when rates drop or make larger monthly payments to pay down debt faster.

            "title": "Standard Repayment Plan: What It Is, How It Works",
            "content": "Drazen Zigic / Getty Images The standard repayment plan is the default repayment option for federal student loans, which features fixed interest rates and monthly payments for 10 years (up to 30 years for consolidation loans). When you take out federal loans, you\u2019re responsible for paying them back not long after you leave school, and unless you apply and are approved for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, your loan service will automatically place you on the standard repayment plan. Learn more about how the standard repayment plan works and how to tell if it\u2019s the right repayment option for you. There are several different types of student loans. The most significant difference is between federal student loans and private student loans. The government funds federal student loans, while private student loans come from banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions. There are four primary types of federal student loans: Certain loans made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program were also automatically placed under the standard repayment plan. As this program ended in 2010, all new federal loans are made through the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program. You\u2019re automatically enrolled in the standard repayment plan if you don't select a repayment plan when you finish school. The standard 10-year repayment plan will help you pay off your loans faster than other repayment options, but it will likely also require higher monthly payments. If you consolidate your federal student debt into a direct consolidation loan, you could lower your monthly payments, but it may take longer to pay off (which could mean paying more in interest in the long run). While the standard repayment plan is the default repayment plan for most borrowers, other repayment options are also available. The graduated repayment plan starts with lower payments in the first two years and then gradually increases, typically every two years. As with the standard repayment plan, your loans will be paid off in 10 years. The goal is to pay less when you\u2019re just entering the workforce and then pay more as you earn more money. The expectation with the graduated repayment plan is that you\u2019ll earn lower incomes in entry-level positions and then earn more as your career advances. As such, the increase in your student loan payments is intended to match an anticipated pay raise. Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans are based on your discretionary income and family size. There are four types of IDR plans: Some student loans are ineligible for IDR plans. For instance, PLUS loans made to parents of undergraduate students are only eligible for ICR plans if they\u2019ve been consolidated into a direct consolidation loan. All IDR plans require annual updates to your income and family size. Your loans are then forgiven once you\u2019ve made payments for a set amount of time\u201420 or 25 years, depending on the plan. On July 18, a federal appeals court blocked the SAVE plan until two court cases centered around the IDR plan can be resolved. The Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into an interest-free forbearance while the litigation is ongoing. It has also outlined options for borrowers who were nearing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)\u2014borrowers can either \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit, if they would reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance, or switch to a different IDR plan. If you can\u2019t make payments under the standard repayment plan, you can contact your loan servicer about deferment or forbearance options. You can also ask about IDR plans that base your payments on your income and family size. No, you won\u2019t be eligible for loan forgiveness under the standard repayment plan. To qualify for student debt forgiveness, you\u2019ll have to apply and be approved for an IDR plan. Alternatively, there are also specialized loan forgiveness programs for borrowers working in certain public service, educational, or military professions. No, private student loans aren\u2019t eligible for the standard repayment plan. The standard repayment plan is for federal student loans only. The standard repayment plan is the federal student loan repayment plan you\u2019ll be placed in after you leave school unless you enroll in a different repayment plan.

            "content": "It Just Might Be Harder to Get Approved for a Mortgage Willie B. Thomas / GettyImages It's entirely possible to get a home loan while carrying student loan debt, so long as you still meet the lender\u2019s criteria. However, having student loan debt can make buying a home more difficult, as lenders will review your financial situation, including how your debt compares to your income, to ensure you can repay your loan. Carrying student loan debt generally makes qualifying for a home loan more difficult for several reasons. First, student loan debt increases your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, which lenders use to assess your risk as a borrower. Your DTI is essentially the proportion of debt payments you have each month compared to your monthly income. Many lenders require DTI ratios that are 36% or less, but some lenders have higher maximums. The higher your DTI ratio, the more difficult it will be to get approved for a home loan. Your credit score is based on several factors, including your payment history, credit utilization ratio, credit mix, the amount of new credit you've recently taken out, and the length of your credit history. Managing on-time payments on your student loan debt for a few years will demonstrate your creditworthiness, which can benefit your credit score. However, having student debt can also negatively impact your score. For instance, if you\u2019ve ever made late payments on your student loans or missed payments entirely, your credit score likely declined as a result. If your loans went into default, your score may have also taken a hit. It can take several years for your credit score to rebound from a default. Student debt also lowers your credit utilization ratio by increasing your debt. The less student debt you have in relation to how much you earn, the easier it will be to qualify for a home loan and get better rates. If your student debt has spiraled out of control, then working with one of the best credit counseling services may be able to help you get back on track. The terms \"home loan\" and \"mortgage\" are frequently used synonymously, but they aren't technically the same thing. A mortgage is a type of loan that's secured by the property it's taken out for. Meanwhile, a home loan is typically a mortgage used to buy a house. However, a home loan can also describe any kind of debt that's used to purchase a home. This includes unsecured personal loans as well as home loans that are secured by a different kind of asset. The main benefit of these types of home loans is that a borrower isn't at risk of their home being foreclosed on should they default. The ways in which student loan debt affects buying a home are more or less the same regardless of the type of home loan you opt to take out. You should keep in mind that unsecured home loans will likely have much higher interest rates than their secured counterparts. Additionally, it may be difficult to find an offer for the amount of funding needed to purchase a home without using a mortgage. If you have a sufficient amount of cash, you don't have to use a home loan to purchase a house and can instead buy one outright. This would save you the most money in the long run, as you won't be paying interest on your debt, but if you're repaying your student loans, this can make it harder to save for such a large purchase. If you have student loans and are worried about qualifying for a home loan, you should shop around for different loan options. Conventional loans, the most common home loan type, are private loans that come from banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Home loans backed by the federal government include Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, VA loans, and USDA home loans. (*As of July 2024. FHA and VA rates based on on latest Zillow data.) Lenders and loan types vary with the terms they offer, so compare different home loan offerings to find the one that best suits your needs. Be direct and honest with your potential lender when you fill out your home loan application. Lenders will have access to your financial documents and accounts, and they will verify your information with a hard credit check. If you can, provide any details and documents related to your student loan debt, including recent payments, lender information, and tax returns to show your previous loan payments and any paid-off debt you may have. Talking with a home loan provider about your situation and needs can help you determine which type of loan would fit your situation. By doing so, you may decide that you need more time to pay off your student loan debt before getting a home loan. Alternatively, you might realize you are financially ready to buy a home even with your student debt. If you decide to go with a mortgage, then the right one for you will depend on your circumstances. For instance, you might qualify for a VA loan, which doesn\u2019t require a down payment or a minimum credit score, or you might find that your DTI is too high to get a VA loan, so a conventional loan may be a better fit. As you'll have to manage both your student loan and home loan repayments at the same time, it may be a good idea to make the former easier to manage before applying for the latter. You might be able to reduce your monthly payments by consolidating, refinancing, or enrolling in a different repayment plan. For example, you may qualify for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan for your federal student loans (private student loans won't have this option). This type of plan calculates your monthly payments based on a portion of your income and household size. Enrolling in this type of plan may free up some cash that could be put toward repaying a home loan, which would make you a more appealing applicant to a lender. Your student loan debt can impact your credit score in several ways. The more debt you carry, the lower your credit score. If you miss a payment or default, your score could also suffer. However, making on-time payments on your student debt can help improve your credit, as it shows you\u2019re responsible with credit. Your ideal debt-to-income (DTI) ratio depends on the lender and the type of home loan. Lenders generally like to see a DTI lower than 36%, but some lenders may allow DTI ratios of 43% or even higher. The lower your DTI ratio, the more responsible you look to lenders, and the better your chances of getting approved for a home loan. You can still buy a home while paying off your student loans. However, the more money you have to put towards your home and related costs, the easier it will be to repay your debt and other expenses every month. Paying off your student loans can increase the chances you will qualify for a home loan with the best interest rate. You might be eligible for student loan forgiveness if you\u2019re a teacher or you work for the government or a not-for-profit organization. If you\u2019re been repaying your loans through an IDR plan, you might also qualify if you've made 20 or 25 years of on-time payments. You may want to contact your lender to see if you\u2019re eligible for forgiveness. You might be able to add your student loan debt into a mortgage by refinancing your current home loan, but not by taking out a new mortgage for a new home. However, refinancing to pay off your student loan can come at a cost. You might end up paying more in interest in the long term. If you have federal student loans, you would lose the opportunity to get deferred payments, forbearance, forgiveness, or alternative repayment plans. You can buy a home while carrying student loan debt, depending on your income and current debt obligations. The more debt you hold, however, the more difficult it will be to do so. Review all your options for home loans and calculate how a monthly payment may fit into your budget, considering you'll already be repaying your student loans. In some cases, you may have to pay down some of your debt before you can get approved for a home loan.

            "title": "FFEL Program Student Loans: What They Are, How They Work",
            "content": "Oscar Wong / Getty Images Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program students loans, which were loans facilitated through private lenders but guaranteed by the federal government, are no longer available for new borrowers. However, many people who took out these loans more than a decade ago still have them. Unfortunately, some student loan relief options, including most income-driven repayment (IDR) plans and public service loan forgiveness (PSLF) plans, exclude FFEL program loans. So, many students consolidate eligible FFEL loans into a direct consolidation loan that lets them maintain federal benefits and protections while unlocking access to enhanced repayment and forgiveness options. If you have FFEL loans or just want to learn more about them, read on to learn the history of these loans and options for current borrowers. The U.S. Department of Education worked with private lenders to provide student loans guaranteed by the federal government through the FFEL program. Loans that fell within this program included: Some FFEL program loans were (and still are) held by the Education Department, but most were held by a commercial lender or guaranty agency. This created problems for borrowers who still had these loans after the program ended. Loans held by private lenders or guaranty agencies became ineligible for most federal student loan relief programs and forgiveness plans. The United States federal government began offering student loans in 1965 through a program that\u2019s known today as the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program. This wasn't the government's first foray into the student loan landscape. The first federal student loans were offered under the National Defense Education Act of 1958. The FFEL program was built on those first federal loans but had the backing of the U.S. government, meaning it agreed to take financial responsibility for student loan amounts not paid back. The FFEL Program ended July 1, 2010. After that, FFEL loans were no longer available to new borrowers. However, borrowers who previously took out loans through the program still had them when it ended, and some still do. All new federal student loans available today are offered through the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program. However, borrowers who still have FFEL program loans have options when it comes to qualifying for a lower monthly payment, getting out of debt faster, or both. If you consolidate a FFEL PLUS loan made to parents, it will only be eligible for income-driven repayment on the income-contingent repayment plan (ICR). Log into your studentaid.gov account to see the kinds of loans you have under the \"Loan Breakdown\" and \"View Loans\" tabs. If a loan has \"FFEL\" listed before the loan amount or other information, the loan is part of this program. Some FFEL Program loans are held by the U.S. Department of Education, whereas others are held by private lenders or guaranty agencies. You can repay your student loans under the current plan they're on, and you can repay most FFEL loans on at least one income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. You can also consolidate these loans with a federal direct consolidation loan in order to access more IDR options and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). While consolidating your loan can give you more student loan repayment options overall, it could also lead to paying more in interest over time if you change your loan repayment term. If you consolidate loans that aren\u2019t direct loans, you can also lose out on certain borrower benefits you had before. These can include interest rate discounts, loan cancellation benefits, or principal rebates. Borrowers can qualify for loan forgiveness with FFEL loans through IDR plans. However, borrowers must consolidate with a direct consolidation loan to access all IDR plans currently available or to qualify for PSLF. While FFEL Program loans are no longer available to new borrowers, their legacy still continues on\u2014for better or for worse. Fortunately, borrowers who have these loans don't have to stick with them if they don't want to. FFEL loans can be consolidated into a direct consolidation loan, which opens the door to a broader range of repayment and loan forgiveness options.

            "content": "Federal or private? A complete guide to your financing options Jeff Bergen / Getty Images You can get a student loan through the federal government or from a private lender. You can go online to apply for student loans through the lender's website or, with private lenders, you may be able to apply in-person at a brick-and-mortar branch. When it comes to getting a student loan, it all depends on the financing source: federal versus private student loans. Knowing the differences between federal and private student loans can help you make a more informed decision about paying for college. Generally, federal student loans are available to any eligible U.S. citizen, regardless of income or credit score. The amount you can borrow is capped based on your year in school. Loan rates are set each year using a formula set by Congress. On the other hand, private student loans are issued by banks, credit unions, and other lenders. You usually need a credit check, and there might be an income requirement. If approved, you can usually borrow enough money to cover the cost of attendance. Your interest rate depends on your creditworthiness and other criteria set by the lender. Source: Federal Student Aid Federal student loans are easy to get\u2014at least up to the maximum allowed for your school year. There are two types of undergraduate student loans: To apply for federal student loans, you must take the following steps: Most undergraduates also need at least one parent or guardian to provide information so the government can determine how much the family expects to contribute toward the cost of attendance. It doesn't affect how much you can borrow. All eligible students can borrow the same amount. The deadline to complete the FAFSA is June 30 of each academic year. The FAFSA opens on Oct. 1 of each year for the following academic year. The FAFSA form for the 2025\u201326 school year has been delayed. Instead of becoming available on Oct. 1, 2024, it will now be available in on or before Dec. 1, 2024. Some schools and states have their own FAFSA deadlines. Be aware of these deadlines because they can affect whether you receive need-based financial aid, such as grants, scholarships, and federal work-study. Information from your FAFSA goes to the schools you designate, which then prepare your financial aid offers. Each school will let you know whether you're being offered scholarships and grants. They might also let you know if you qualify for federal work-study. Finally, your financial aid offer may also include federal student loans. Carefully read the offer to understand how much of the cost of attendance is covered by financial aid, including federal student loans. If all of your federal aid isn't enough to cover all of your costs, you might need to dip into your savings and/or take out private student loans to fill the funding gap. You must accept your federal student loans in order to receive them. Your school will tell you how to accept all or a part of your loans. You also have to complete loan counseling before you receive federal student loan funds. Private student loans can bridge the gap if you need extra money to pay for school, although you may have a higher interest rate than with federal student loans. You can find private student loan options online via a financial institution's website and at many bank or credit union branches. Ideally, you should compare three to five lenders before applying for one. You may need a co-signer to be approved, as there may be a minimum credit score requirement you might not be able to qualify for. While the interest rate is important, it shouldn't be your only consideration choosing a private lender. Look for ones with repayment plans that fit your budget and plans. Consider perks, like a longer repayment term or potential hardship or forbearance programs. It's also worth asking if your debts will be discharged should you pass away or suffer a permanent disability. If you plan to attend graduate school, find out if you can defer repayment while completing the next phase of your academic career. Finally, if you need a co-signer to qualify, consider choosing a lender that will release them after you show you can take over payments. When applying for private student loans, you must provide information about your identity and income, much as you would with any other loan application. Before you actually apply, check if the lenders you're considering offer pre-qualification. If you don't pre-qualify, you may need to include a co-signer on your loan application. Private student loans aren't eligible for federal student loan forgiveness programs, and there are few programs that forgive private student loans. Most lenders only cancel private student debt in the event of death or permanent disability, though they aren't legally required to do so. Federal student loan terms aren't negotiable. They're standardized, and you must accept and abide by them if you want federal loans. Yes, you can refinance your student loan. However, if you refinance federal loans, they become private loans and are no longer eligible for federal programs like income-driven repayment and debt forgiveness. Federal student loans are available to everyone and come with standardized terms. Private student loans might allow you to borrow more, but they're subject to credit approval and interest rates vary. Generally, it's recommended to get federal student loans before turning to private loans to fill any college funding gaps.

            "content": "Understand the costs you can cover with a student loan Skynesher / Getty Images With the average cost of out-of-state tuition at $29,150 per year, it's no surprise that many students need loans to cover their expenses. Even the $11,260 average sticker price for in-state tuition might feel out of reach for many students. Fortunately, you can use student loan money to pay for tuition, fees, books, equipment, food and housing, as well as many other school-related expenses. If you use debt to pay for college, you'll want to understand what student loans can be used for. Student loans are designed to fill the gap in paying for college. For many, savings, scholarships, and grants can't completely cover the cost associated with getting a higher education. There are two main types of student loans: Generally, student loans are meant for costs directly related to attending school. If you have money left over from the loans after all expenses are covered, consider putting those funds toward paying down your debt so you save money in interest in the long run. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the following are all considered qualified education expenses: The money you pay for tuition and any required fees (such as activity fees) are clearly educational costs associated with attending school. You can use student loans to pay these, which are generally one of the most expensive aspects of paying college costs. Student loan money can be used to cover tuition and other costs associated with study abroad programs. You can use student loans to pay the cost of your on-campus housing and meal plan. If you live off-campus, you can use student loans to cover rent payments. You can also use student loans for utilities and groceries while living off-campus. You can pay for required textbooks with student loans. It's also acceptable to use student loans to pay for books, supplies, special equipment required for a course, and other necessary items. It's also possible to spend student loan money on essential technology. Most students today need computers as well as word-processing software and other programs for class. Your student loans can be used to cover these costs. If you need a bus pass or to pay a parking fee to be on campus, your student loans can cover these expenses. Additionally, if you travel a significant distance to visit home during school breaks, those transportation costs can also be covered with student loans. If you have children, you can include your dependent care expenses in your cost of attendance. As a result, you might be able to pay these costs with your student loan funds. Not every expense you incur while in school will be a qualified education expense. You may be penalized for purchases that weren't approved by your loan servicer. Some purchases that you shouldn't use your student loan funds for include: Enforcement of what you use student loans for is fairly rare, but it's possible that you could be subject to penalties if you use your student loan money inappropriately. Even if you aren't penalized by the government or your servicer, having that extra debt could cost you hundreds of extra dollars in interest. You can return unused student loan money by notifying your school that you want to cancel part or all of your loan. If they haven't disbursed the money to you, it won't be recorded as part of your debt. If the money has already been disbursed, you can avoid interest and fees on the portion that you return by sending it to the servicer within 120 days. Generally, personal lenders won't allow you to use the money for educational purposes. Instead, if you need more than what you received in federal student aid, you can consider getting a private student loan. Student loans and scholarships can help you pay for college if you cannot afford to pay out of pocket. However, borrowing exactly what you need is important to avoid getting deeply into debt. Consider getting a part-time job, applying for scholarships and grants, and looking for other ways to cover costs so you don't need to borrow as much to complete your degree.

            "title": "Concerned About Student Debt? Use This Guide to Avoid Borrowing Too Much",
            "content": "Prostock Studio / Getty Images Student loan debt has become a crisis for many Americans who have pursued higher education, with the average balance reaching $37,852.80 in Q2 2024. In order to not have more student loan debt than they need, borrowers should avoid taking out an amount greater than their expected first-year salary in their chosen field. The best time to consider how much student debt you can handle is before enrolling in college. After all, you'll have fewer options regarding saving for school if you're already enrolled. You\u2019ll want to consider several factors as you decide how much student debt is enough for you: Federal student loans come with borrowing limits for each school year. However, many students make up the difference with private student loans or borrow money for a higher education in other ways. Regardless, one rule of thumb for student debt is that you should try not to borrow more than the first year salary you can expect in your chosen field. For example, if you expect to earn $38,000 in the first year of your career, you should try to borrow $38,000 or less for your degree. How much student loan debt you have will play a direct role in the financial consequences you'll face. Your future student loan payments may be higher or lower than you expect. The payment plan you choose for your student loans will also impact how much you owe each month until your loans are paid off or forgiven. Consider an example using the Loan Simulator from Federal Student Aid that shows how monthly payments might look after graduation. This simulator estimates that a student who earns a four-year degree from a public institution of higher education will end their college journey with $26,946 in student loan debt and an average interest rate of 3.9%. With this information, the simulator calculates that the monthly payment on a standard 10-year repayment plan would be $272. This means that, over the span of 120 months, the borrower would pay a total of $32,585 toward their student loans, including interest charges. However, the tool also reveals that payments could be much lower for borrowers who opt for an IDR plan. Based on an annual income of $30,000 for a single borrower with $26,946 in student debt, for example, it could be possible to pay as little as $0 per month with the new Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan or as little as $68 with the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Repayment Plan or the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan. On July 18, 2024, a federal appeals court blocked the SAVE plan pending the resolution of two court cases involving the plan. The Department of Education moved borrowers enrolled in SAVE into an interest-free forbearance while the litigation is ongoing. Whether you are trying to avoid borrowing too much for school or looking for ways to manage the debt you already have, there are plenty of resources available. Consider these tools and informational sources to help you effectively manage debt and choose the right repayment plan. When it comes to having too much student loan debt, you can reduce your debt load by taking early action. Consider following these steps to help you borrow less for school. Attending a public, in-state school can cost considerably less than attending an out-of-state school or a private institution of higher education, according to CollegeBoard data. For the 2023\u201324 academic year, average tuition and fees at public four-year in-state schools was $11,260 nationally. Compare that to $29,150 for tuition and fees at four-year, out-of-state public schools and $41,540 for private nonprofit schools. Apply for scholarships and grants you may be eligible for during each year you plan to attend college. Some of the best places to search for scholarships and grants include college and university financial aid offices, public libraries, local foundations, businesses, and ethnic organizations, among others. You can also search for scholarships and grants online with websites like Sallie Mae\u2019s Scholly, the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Scholarship Finder, and CollegeBoard Scholarship Search. Working part-time during school is another way to keep costs down, reducing the need for extra student loans. It may be possible to find employment on your college campus, but you could also get an off-campus job at a restaurant, a retail store, an office, or anywhere else that might let you work part-time with flexible hours and fair pay. Student loans come with many of the same risks as other types of loans, including the risk of borrowing more than you need. This is especially true for federal student loans for graduate students and private student loans since they have much higher borrowing limits. Some dangers of borrowing too much include: How much you earn in the future can impact how much is reasonable to borrow in student loans. Those working toward a degree that will lead to a higher income can typically borrow more since their future income can more easily cover student loan payments. Individuals who plan to enter lower-paying fields should be more careful when it comes to student loan debt. Some student loan alternatives to consider include scholarships, grants, work-study programs, savings, income-share agreements, and crowdfunding. Too much student loan debt can leave you making burdensome loan payments for years or even decades. These payments can make it more difficult to save for retirement or save up the down payment for a home. Borrowers who have trouble making student loan payments or paying their bills on time can also see damage to their credit scores, which can make finances difficult in other ways. Defaulting on federal student loans can also lead to wage garnishment, or the government seizing your tax refunds or government benefits checks. Student loans can be a valuable tool for paying for college, and earning a degree can lead to higher lifetime earnings. However, there's a point where borrowing becomes unreasonable and where the monthly payments for student loans can become a strain. If you plan to take out student loans, you'll be better off in the long run if you borrow exactly what you need to earn a degree and nothing more. This can be accomplished by selecting a more affordable school, applying for scholarships and grants, working during college, or all of the above.

            "content": "Strategies to protect your credit score when you have student loans Miniseries / Getty Images Student loans impact your credit score in several different ways, depending in part on how responsibly you repay them. Missing payments on your student debt can negatively impact your score, while consistently making on-time payments will help build your credit history. If you have at least one other debt vehicle, then taking out student loans will also affect your credit mix. Having a lengthy credit history and a diverse credit mix will, in turn, improve your credit score. Your credit score is a three-digit number meant to give lenders and other financial services providers a quick way to see how you handle credit obligations. Information about payments and the amounts you've borrowed are assigned values, and an advanced formula is used to calculate your score. The main factors for the FICO score, which is one of the most commonly used credit scores, include: Whether you pay on time and in full is one of the most important influencers of your credit score, so student loans can lower your credit score if you miss payments. When you first get a student loan, how it impacts your credit score partially depends on whether or not it requires a hard inquiry, which results in a small (but temporary) credit score decrease. Most federal loans don't require a credit check, so a hard inquiry won't be reported to the credit bureaus. Conversely, PLUS loans\u2014for parents, not those for graduate or professional students\u2014and private loans do require a hard inquiry. Once you have your student loans, the main impact on your credit score will come from your payment history. If you pay late or miss payments, these can be reported to the major credit bureaus and subsequently listed on your credit report, lowering your score. On-time payments can also be reported to the credit bureaus, but this information will eventually increase your score. Plus, because student loans are installment loans, they can also positively impact your credit mix, especially if your only other credit accounts are revolving credit cards. Whether student loan deferral or forbearance will impact your credit score depends on your loan type and whether you applied before you started missing payments. Federal loan deferral usually occurs in specific situations, such as returning to school or military deployment. You can put off making payments during the deferral period without penalty, although interest might still accrue on unsubsidized loans. Federal loan forbearance is usually a result of financial hardship and allows you to stop making payments for up to 12 months at a time, while interest still accrues regardless of your loan type. In most cases, missed federal student loan payments won't be reported unless you default, meaning you haven't made payments for 270 days. The situation with private student loans is different. If they offer a hardship program, you can usually avoid overly negative credit consequences by making payments \"as agreed\" while you're in the program. However, missing a payment before you enter one of these programs can negatively impact your credit score. If you're struggling to make your student debt payments, contact your student loan servicer quickly to set up a plan and prevent your payment from being marked as late or missed. Paying off your student loan can lower the average age of your credit score. Additionally, if you have a limited credit mix, paying off a student loan reduces the types of credit you have. This can result in a temporary dip in your score. If the borrower doesn't make payments, it can show up on a co-signer's credit report. Additionally, the amount borrowed is also reported on the co-signer's credit history and can affect their debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. You might see a dip in your credit score if your student debt is forgiven because your loans are paid off and no longer appear on your credit report, contributing to your credit mix and the length of your credit history. Student loans can affect your credit score in various ways, and much of the impact depends on how you manage these loans. If you make at least the minimum payment on time each month, you can build a positive credit history and avoid the score-busting consequences of missed payments. Budget for student loan payments or, if you have federal loans, consider applying for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan to ensure that your monthly payments are manageable.

            "title": "What Are the 4 Types of Student Loans?",
            "content": "shironosov / Getty Images Student loans are one of the major sources of funding for college education in the U.S. Nearly 43 million borrowers take out federal student loans to pay for school. There are four types of federal student loans: direct subsidized loans, direct unsubsidized loans, direct PLUS loans, and direct consolidation loans. Direct subsidized loans are for undergraduate, dependent students and are based on financial need. You\u2019ll receive an amount based on how much you can afford to repay, up to $5,500 depending on your grade level and dependency status. Subsidized loans are loans in which the federal government pays the interest while you\u2019re in school at least half-time and for six months after you leave school during the grace period. Unsubsidized loans require you to pay for the interest accrued while you\u2019re in school, even if you defer payments until after you graduate. Direct unsubsidized loans are available for both graduate and undergraduate students, and the maximum loan amount isn\u2019t limited based on your grade level or dependency status. These loans are available for independent students as well, since graduate and professional students aren\u2019t considered dependents. You can receive up to $20,500 in direct unsubsidized loans every year, minus any other funds you get from subsidized loans. Direct PLUS loans are available for both graduate students (grad PLUS loans) and parents of dependent students (parent PLUS loans). You\u2019re eligible to borrow up to the cost of attendance determined by your school, minus any other financial aid you receive. Consolidation loans allow you to combine all of your federal loans into one after you leave school. This makes the loans easier to manage. Most federal loans are eligible for consolidation and you\u2019ll need to take this step to qualify for other types of programs. For instance, Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and income-driven repayment (IDR) plans require you to consolidate your loans with a direct consolidation loan before you can benefit from these programs. Private student loans come from private lenders, such as banks, credit unions, and other institutions, rather than the federal government. They have their own regulations and standards, and each lender has their own requirements for qualifications. Many of the best private lenders offer similar types of student loans as those at the federal level, including undergraduate loans, graduate loans, and loans for parents. But unlike most federal loans, your approval is directly dependent on your credit score and history, how much you need, and whether you have a co-signer to help you in case you can\u2019t qualify on your own. Interest rates for private student loans tend to be higher than those for federal loans, but you might have the chance to choose a variable interest rate. Federal student loans only offer fixed interest rates, which change annually and are set by federal law. Fixed interest rates mean the interest rate won\u2019t change for the life of the loan, while variable interest rates can fluctuate based on market conditions. The type of student loan you should get will depend on your needs, your school, and how much additional financial aid you\u2019re receiving. If you want to minimize how much you borrow, exhaust all your free money options (i.e., scholarships and grants) first. Then turn to federal student loans\u2014specifically direct subsidized loans, if possible\u2014if you need to borrow money. Move on to unsubsidized if you have any remaining funding gaps. You may need to tap into private student loans if you\u2019re still struggling to afford school after you\u2019ve exhausted all your other options. Federal student loans are the most common type of student loan. There are four main types of federal student loans: subsidized, unsubsidized, parent loans, and consolidation loans. There are also private student loans, which generally have higher interest rates and stricter requirements. The average student loan payment depends on the types of loans borrowed, repayment terms, and income. Folks who have federal student loans may pay less per month than private student loan borrowers. The average student loan payment per month in 2023 was over $200, according to data from Experian. No, you can\u2019t consolidate a private student loan into a federal student loan. But you can refinance a federal student loan into a private one. Subsidized loans are loans in which the federal government subsidizes, or covers, the interest that accrues on your loans while you\u2019re in school. Unsubsidized loans require you to pay for the interest, even if you aren\u2019t making payments on your loans while enrolled in school. Subsidized loans are generally less expensive than their unsubsidized counterparts. Many personal loan providers have requirements that borrowers need to meet to qualify for a loan. Some prohibit using funds to pay for higher education needs and instead encourage you to take out a student loan. It\u2019s important to know the difference between the four types of student loans as you\u2019re exploring different ways to pay for college. You may qualify for some student loans and not others, so make sure to complete your FAFSA early and determine whether you\u2019ll have any funding gaps that you\u2019ll need to cover.

            "title": "What Percentage of Gross Salary Should Be Allocated to Student Loan Repayment?",
            "content": "Natalia Gdovskaia / Getty Images Ideally, your student loan payments should only make up a small percentage of your gross monthly pay, such as no more than 10%. However, some income-driven repayment (IDR) plans for federal student loans have borrowers paying considerably less than that. There are also several forgiveness plans that can wipe away federal student debt after you make enough on-time payments on your loans. Students on these programs may reach a different conclusion on how much income to allocate to monthly debt payments. This guide will explain the average amount of income students should expect to spend on student loan payments, how different repayment plans change the dynamic, and other details about repaying student loans. There are several schools of thought when it comes to the maximum amount of income to allocate to student debt repayment. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) suggests limiting monthly student debt payments to no more than 10% of your gross monthly income. This means that, if you earn an annual gross income of $50,000, you would make sure your monthly student loan payments never surpass $5,000 per year, or $417 per month. Another CFPB guideline to consider is limiting total student debt to no more than you expect to earn with a starting annual salary after you graduate. For example, if the future earnings you expect to receive will be $40,000, aim to borrow less than that. Presumably, keeping debt within this range will translate into monthly payments that make sense for the commensurate level of income. Keep in mind that many factors can determine the right amount of student debt. Allocating 10% of gross monthly income to student loan debt payments will be easier for some people than others. For example, if you already have a family or other financial obligations like a mortgage, you may need to target a lower percentage of your gross salary to use for student loan repayment. Your repayment plan could dictate how much you pay each month regardless of how much income you have set aside. For example, IDR plans base monthly payments on income and family size regardless of how much student debt you have. For example, with the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, borrowers would pay 5% of their discretionary income toward undergraduate student loans and 10% toward graduate school loans. On July 18, 2024, a federal appeals court blocked the SAVE plan until two court cases centered around the IDR plan can be resolved. The United States Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into an interest-free forbearance while the litigation is ongoing. It has also outlined options for borrowers who were nearing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)\u2014borrowers can either \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if they reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan. Some student loan forgiveness plans erase student debt after enough qualifying monthly payments are made. For example, Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) forgives the loans of eligible public service workers after they make at least 120 monthly payments on an IDR plan, provided their work qualifies. Borrowers in this program might decide to pay whatever monthly payment the program requires to have their remaining student debt forgiven after 10 years. The repayment plan you choose for student loans may ultimately dictate your monthly payment. But it makes sense to make sure you have enough money in your budget to cover student loans. If you want to keep your monthly payment to no more than 10% of your gross monthly income, the calculation for your maximum monthly payment is fairly straightforward. Divide your gross annual income by 12 months. Your maximum monthly payment should be no more than 10% of that amount. With a gross annual income of $60,000, for example, your maximum monthly payment works out to $500. $60,000 / 12 months = $5,000 $5,000 x 0.10 = $500 If you decide to repay your student loans using an IDR plan, your monthly payment will be based on your discretionary income. According to the U.S. Department of Education, discretionary income is based on your annual income, family size, and the state you live in. On the SAVE plan, discretionary income is defined as the \"difference between your annual income and 225% of the poverty guideline for your family size and state of residence.\" With the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan, the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Plan, and loan rehabilitation, on the other hand, your discretionary income is the difference between 150% of the poverty guideline for your family size and state of residence. Generally, aim to borrow as little as you can for college, and opt for a more affordable monthly payment. However, there are situations where you may want to pay as much as you can to get out of debt faster. For example, you may want to reduce your debt to better qualify for a mortgage. The right repayment amount to target depends on how much debt you have and your future financial goals. Consider these tips for managing student loans with minimal impact on your lifestyle. The average length of time to repay student debt depends on the repayment plan chosen. For example, borrowers can repay their loans on the standard plan for federal student loans, which last for 10 years. IDR plans require monthly payments for 20 to 25 years before any remaining loan balances are forgiven. Federal student loan payment options include the standard 10-year repayment plans, IDR plans, graduated repayment, and extended repayment. Student loans are typically considered good debt since earning a college degree can lead to higher earnings. For example, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data shows that people with a bachelor's degree earned average weekly wages of $1,493 in 2023, compared to weekly earnings of $899 for those with a high school diploma. The amount of money to set aside for student debt will vary from person to person. Have a plan for your debt, and ensure you have enough money to cover student loan payments after paying other bills. Consider budgeting for a monthly student loan payment that's at or below 10% of your gross income, even if you end up paying a much smaller amount on an IDR plan.

            "content": "simonkr / Getty Images If you have a complete and total disability, you may not be liable for repaying certain types of federal student loans. This is based on eligibility for the Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) Discharge Program, which is offered through the United States Department of Education and overseen by student loan servicer Nelnet. You need to meet specific disability requirements to qualify for loan forgiveness through this program, and there are three main ways you can get approved. If you are experiencing a total disability and you struggle to repay federal student loans as a result, read on to find out which programs provide relief and how to apply. The Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) Discharge Program is for student loan borrowers who are totally disabled and unable to work as a result. This student loan forgiveness program aims to relieve eligible individuals of their federal student loan debt obligations based on their inability to repay. TPD discharge can apply to federal student loans that fall under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, and the Federal Perkins Loan Program. The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant service obligations can also qualify. Applicants need to prove they are totally and permanently disabled to qualify for student loan forgiveness. They can do this by providing supporting information through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the Social Security Administration (SSA), or an eligible medical professional. To apply for this program, the U.S. Department of Education recommends you do any of the following: Once the application is complete, you can mail it to: U.S. Department of Education \u2013 TPD ServicingP.O. Box 87130Lincoln, NE 68501-7130 The U.S. Department of Education doesn\u2019t have a list of specific disabilities that can qualify you for total loan forgiveness of your student loans through the TPD Discharge Program. However, you must be totally and permanently disabled, meaning you\u2019d be unable to work and repay student loan obligations. While the factors used to determine total and permanent disability can be subjective and based on the personal opinion of a medical professional, the Education Department gives physicians ways to quantify total disability for other purposes. Specifically, a person is permanently and totally disabled if the following applies: The steps you'll take to prove total and permanent disability depend on the avenue you plan to take to apply for the TPD Discharge Program. Here's a rundown of what's required to apply through the Veterans Affairs Department, the SSA, or an eligible medical professional. You can receive student loan discharge through the TPD Discharge Program directly through the Veterans Affairs Department as a military veteran. In this case, you can have your federal student loans discharged if one of the following applies: You may receive a letter automatically if you qualify for loan discharge based on an eligible disability. You can also apply for the program and provide documentation that shows the Veterans Affairs Department awarded you the disability determination. You may also be eligible for student loan discharge through this program if you're already eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. One of the following must be true to become eligible this way: You may receive a letter automatically if you qualify for loan discharge based on an eligible disability. You can also apply for the program and provide documentation that proves your disability, including one of the following: You can also apply for TPD discharge by having a medical professional certify that you have a total and permanent disability. However, not all medical professionals can make this determination. It must come from one of the following: The medical professional must be certified to practice in the United States, and they must provide you with documentation that shows you are \u201cunable to engage in any substantial gainful activity.\u201d Documentation must also show that your inability to work is based on a physical or mental impairment that: Having student loans forgiven through a TPD discharge can help disabled individuals move on with their lives without the stress of having to repay student loan debt. However, there are a few other programs that can help in this respect. The TEACH Grant is a higher education grant that promises funding for college if you agree to complete a teaching service obligation. This grant is worth up to $4,000 a year for students who are planning to begin a teaching career after graduation. Under normal circumstances, the grant is turned into a loan that must be repaid if the student doesn't complete the teaching service obligation required for the funding. However, individuals who become totally and permanently disabled can have the teaching service obligation canceled under this program. This means students can attend college, receive the grant, and enter any other field of work (or not work at all) without having to repay the funds provided they can prove disabled status. The Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan is an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan worth considering if you apply for a TPD discharge and can't get approved. After all, this program lets borrowers repay their loans over 20 to 25 years before having their remaining loan balances forgiven. Individuals who borrowed less than $12,000 for higher education can also have their loans forgiven in as little as 10 years. Payments are based on income and family size and are 5% of discretionary income for undergraduate student loans and 10% of discretionary income for graduate school loans. The benefit for disabled borrowers is the increased income threshold for individuals to qualify for a $0 monthly payment under the plan. Essentially, your monthly payment is based on the difference between your adjusted gross income (AGI) and 225% of the U.S. federal poverty limit. For example, 225% of the federal poverty limit in most states works out to $32,800. This means individuals who earn less than $32,800 and don't have any dependents would have a monthly payment of $0. However, earning thresholds are higher based on family size or whether you have a spouse, dependents, or both. A family of four with an annual income of $67,500 or less would also qualify for a $0 monthly payment on federal student loans. On July 18, 2024, a federal appeals court blocked the SAVE plan pending the resolution of two court cases involving the plan. The Department of Education moved borrowers enrolled in SAVE into an interest-free forbearance while the litigation is ongoing. You cannot have your personal loans forgiven through the Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) Discharge Program if your spouse is disabled. However, your spouse may qualify for discharge of their own student loans through the program. Eligibility for federal student loans is not impacted by partial or total disability. You can apply for federal student loans by filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Loans (FAFSA). Having student loans forgiven may cause your credit score to drop slightly, but only because removing student loans from your credit profile could impact your credit mix. This factor makes up 10% of FICO scores, and individuals score better when they have more types of loans versus fewer. Outside of that, having student loans forgiven shouldn\u2019t negatively impact your credit score. The TPD Discharge Program can provide essential relief from student loan debt if you cannot work due to a physical or mental impairment that has left you totally disabled. However, you may encounter some challenges in getting approved for the program, including the requirement to supply documentation that proves you cannot work.

            "content": "Work at these jobs long enough and your student loan balance may be forgiven RuslanDashinsky / GettyImages Student loan forgiveness is a way to have a portion or all of what you owe on your student loan balance canceled after you meet certain conditions. There are various student loan forgiveness programs, including Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), Teacher Loan Forgiveness, and National Health Service Corps (NHSC) repayment. Common jobs that can potentially qualify for student loan forgiveness include K\u201312 teachers in a public school, health care providers in a rural area, city government workers, or professors at a public university. Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) is designed to incentivize college graduates to pursue careers that they might otherwise dismiss due to a low earning potential. These careers are often in crucial fields, such as health care and education. By offering PSLF, the government hopes that more people will pursue careers that serve the public good. To qualify for student loan forgiveness under PSLF, you must: When seeking PSLF, you must understand the criteria for employment and your qualifying payments. While your 120 qualifying payments don't need to be consecutive, any payment you make must happen while working for a qualifying employer and meeting the other required employment conditions. When you receive PSLF, it won't be reported as income on your tax return, so you won't have to worry about paying federal taxes on your forgiven debt. However, some states do levy taxes on canceled debts. Another thing to keep in mind is that you're able to consolidate loans with qualifying payments with other loans that don't have these payments. However, your new timeline will be adjusted based on the average of all qualifying payments made on the consolidated loans. For example, if you have 60 qualifying payments toward some loans, and consolidate with other loans that have no qualifying payments, your new timeline will reflect 30 qualifying payments. Note that \u201cqualifying employment\u201d for PSLF isn't necessarily about a specific job but is instead more focused on who you're working for. Eligible employers include: You must be working full-time for a qualifying employer for your payments to be credited toward PSLF. Full-time is defined, for the purposes of PSLF, as working for a weekly average of at least 30 hours. Some exceptions include K\u201312 teachers who are contracted to work at least eight months of the year. They are considered working full-time throughout the year, even if they don't work in the summer. There's also a formula for university professors in a non-tenure track position so they can count credits taught each week and use a multiplier to reach the required full-time status. Private student loans aren't eligible for federal loan forgiveness programs like PSLF. You must have a direct loan in order to qualify for PSLF. Check with the U.S. Department of Education to verify employer eligibility. It's also important to fill out the annual certification updates with the Education Department to create a paper trail of your employment and qualifying payments. When it's time to have your balance forgiven, having documentation will make the process easier. Here are some specific types of jobs that come with special rules when qualifying for PSLF: There are additional programs, other than PSLF, that offer student loan forgiveness for other jobs. If you teach in a low-income school for five consecutive years, you might qualify for up to $17,500 with Teacher Loan Forgiveness. For some teachers, this can be a way to get a large portion of their loans forgiven in a shorter period of time. It's important to note, however, that the five years you spend teaching to get Teacher Loan Forgiveness won't count for PSLF. You'll need to make an additional 120 qualifying payments to get PSLF if you have your loans partially forgiven under Teacher Loan Forgiveness. There are various programs for health care providers who work in underserved communities and meet certain requirements. For example, physicians and certain nurses who work in eligible rural areas might be eligible for up to $100,000 in student loan forgiveness after providing full-time services for three years. Other programs allow health care providers to get up to $75,000 for full-time work in other designated areas. Look into the NHSC program to see if you qualify for additional enhancements, such as Spanish language proficiency, or if you can get forgiveness for working part-time. Check to see if your state has any dedicated student loan forgiveness programs. Some states offer their own teacher loan forgiveness programs, in addition to programs designed for student cancellation for health care providers. Other professions might be included as well, depending on what the states currently feel they need. In these cases, your employer might not need to meet certain qualifications, so long as the job you have qualifies for a state-level forgiveness program. Student loan forgiveness might lead to a slight drop in your credit score. This is because student loans are considered installment loans as part of your credit mix. When you're no longer paying on them, that may change your credit profile and can have a negative impact. However, it's usually a minor impact that isn't long-lasting. Yes, your entire remaining student debt balance, including any interest, is forgiven through PSLF. The terms are usually used to distinguish the reasons behind having your student debt canceled. Forgiveness is used when you have specific conditions, such as being on an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan for a specific amount of time or by meeting program requirements, such as for PSLF. Discharge usually refers to having your loan balance canceled because of an inability to pay, such as because of permanent disability. Jobs that qualify for student loan forgiveness often pay less, but student loan forgiveness for careers that serve the public good might be considered a good trade-off. Often, student loan forgiveness, especially PSLF, is paired with consolidating your student loans and then getting on an IDR plan. That way your qualifying payments are low and manageable while you work toward forgiveness.

            "content": "Learn what can prevent you from getting federal student loans Klaus Vedfelt / Getty Images Federal student loans offer one of the easiest ways to get funding for a higher education, which is becoming increasingly expensive. While almost every U.S. citizen is eligible for federal student loans, some things can disqualify you. Let's take a look at what can keep you from getting federal student loans. To secure funding for higher education, you can apply for either private or federal student loans. Private student loans have varying eligibility factors depending on the lender. Often, private student loans require a more stringent credit check instead of being based on borrowers' needs like federal student loans are. Federal student loans are generally easier to qualify for, but they do have criteria. If you want to get federal student loans, it's important to understand the eligibility requirements as well as what might disqualify you from receiving financial aid. To get any federal financial aid, you must fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This form collects information about your status as a student and your family's financial situation to determine what federal grants and programs you're eligible for. It's also required to get student loans. You must file the FAFSA each year to remain eligible to receive federal student loans while you're in college. Certain criminal convictions can reduce your eligibility for federal student loans. Drug convictions no longer impact your qualifications, but if you're incarcerated, your eligibility is limited. Once you're out of incarceration and you're serving probation or on parole, you might be able to receive federal student aid again. In general, you need to be a citizen of the United States to qualify for federal student loans. However, some eligible noncitizens can still qualify for student loans. You need to have specific documentation, such as an I-551, I-151, or I-94. A T-Visa, which is used for those who are victims of human trafficking, might also help you qualify for student loans. Undocumented noncitizens, including DACA students, aren't eligible for federal student loans. You must have a high school diploma or equivalent to be eligible to receive federal student loans. Usually, if you don't have a diploma, you can also qualify with a GED. In some cases, you can even qualify if you've completed a homeschool program, but you may need to provide additional documentation. Once you have student loans, you're expected to meet the requirements of your school program. This includes being enrolled at least half-time in your eligible program and making progress toward your degree or certificate. If you're not meeting your school's requirements for forward progress, you might not be able to get a student loan for the next year. Do you have previous student loans? If you do, and you're in default, you won't be approved for additional student loans. The same is true of grant refunds. If you want to be able to take out more federal student loans, you need to rehabilitate defaulted loans. There are other eligibility requirements, such as consenting to have your federal tax information transferred to your FAFSA, that you need to meet. If you're under 24, unmarried, or working toward an undergraduate degree, you'll need to include information about your parents as well. If they don't fill in the information, you won't qualify for federal student loans. In general, it's harder to qualify for private student loans. Most private student lenders have income and credit requirements, which are not part of the criteria for federal student loans. If your federal student loans don't cover all of your expenses, you might need to fill the gap with private loans. Basic eligibility for federal student loans is fairly straightforward. You don't need to worry about a credit check. The eligibility requirements include: If you're disqualified from getting federal student loans, you can take some steps to regain eligibility. One of the most common issues is student loan default. You can rehabilitate your student loans with the help of consolidation or use the Fresh Start program offered through the U.S. Department of Education. With the Fresh Start program, you can work toward getting your loans out of default so you're eligible to borrow again. To gain eligible noncitizen status, you can go through the process of getting the right paperwork. If you've been a victim of human trafficking or you've been abused in your country of origin, you might be able to get a visa that makes you eligible. Depending on where you're coming from, you might be able to apply for the right forms and visas to change your status or regain your status. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service can help. You might also need to talk to your school about getting back on track if your grades have fallen or you had to leave school for a semester. Your school can help you enroll in the proper number of classes and help you begin making progress toward regaining eligibility. Additionally, there are ways to establish your eligibility even without a high school diploma or GED. The \"ability-to-benefit\" alternatives offered by the Education Department\u00a0include taking a special test at your school or completing six credit hours toward a degree or certificate without federal aid. Afterward, you might be eligible for student loans to finish your education. No, there is no income limit to fill out the FAFSA. Anyone of any income level can be eligible for unsubsidized federal student loans. However, grants, subsidized loans, and other types of aid may have income limits. The unsubsidized federal student loan is automatically provided to everyone who meets basic eligibility criteria. This makes it the easiest to get because anyone can receive it. There is no credit requirement for federal undergraduate student loans. Basic credit requirements need to be met for PLUS loans. However, credit scoring generally isn't used to determine eligibility for federal student loans. Federal student loans are fairly easy to qualify for compared to private student loans, but these loans do have standards. Not everyone will be eligible for a federal student loan. Understanding the requirements of what you're applying for will help you take steps to increase your chances of getting approved.

            "title": "What Happens to Student Loans When You Die?",
            "content": "Student loans are typically discharged if the borrower dies, but it isn't always this simple with private loans wagnerokasaki / GettyImages Federal student loans and many private student loan policies have cancellation policies when either the student or the parent who borrowed on behalf of a student dies. While most loans have these agreements in place, there are some instances where you might have to repay a loan after a loved one has died, such as with some private student loans. If you die, your federal student loans are discharged, meaning your obligation to repay some or all of the remaining balance on your loan is canceled. The lender will need proof of death with an original death certificate, a certified copy of a death certificate, or a photocopy of either that\u2019s accurate and legible. Family members aren\u2019t responsible for repaying federal student loan debt. If a parent takes out a Parent PLUS loan on behalf of a student, that loan is discharged if the student who benefitted from that loan dies. It\u2019s also discharged if the parent who took out that loan for their child dies. So neither the parent nor the student is responsible for repaying this loan if either dies. While federal student loans have clearly outlined rules regarding death and discharge, private student loans don\u2019t offer the same deals. That\u2019s because private student loans don\u2019t have the same regulations or standards as federal student loans, so they don\u2019t operate the same way. For instance, when there was a moratorium placed on student loans during the COVID-19 pandemic, borrowers weren\u2019t obligated to make federal student loan payments. But for private student loan borrowers, pausing payments was done on a case-by-case basis. In most instances, private student loan lenders will cancel your student loans if you die. But not all lenders go this route, and even among lenders, not all deaths may qualify for discharge. If the loan was taken out after Nov. 20, 2018, private lenders are federally required to release co-signers from the loan. But for loans taken out before this, it\u2019s up to the lender to decide if the student loan gets discharged. Like federal student loans, some private lenders who do allow discharge due to death may require proof, like a death certificate or a copy of one. Your individual loan agreement will have more details about your policy; alternatively, you can contact your lender about the next steps. Most federal student loans are discharged upon the death of the student or the individual who borrowed on behalf of one. But remember, private student loans are a little different. When a student dies with private student loans, they are managed like most other debts and become part of the deceased\u2019s estate. Then the loans go through probate unless there is an established and legal estate plan. There are a few different ways to protect your loved ones from repaying your student loans when you die, including: Everyone\u2019s situation is different, and it\u2019s a good idea to talk with an estate attorney who can walk you through your individual needs. If you have federal student loans, your spouse is usually not responsible for your student loans if you die. If you have private student loans, your partner might be responsible for your student loans depending on your lender and individual circumstances. It\u2019s important to contact the borrower\u2019s loan servicer as soon as you\u2019re able to regarding the death. Once you have a death certificate, a certified copy of the death certificate, or a legitimate copy of either, reach out to the borrower\u2019s loan servicer and explain what happened. They\u2019ll walk you through the next steps. Most unsecured debts are forgiven at death, like student loans, credit card debt, and medical debt. However, lenders are not always obligated to discharge debt at death, so be sure to check the terms of a loan for this policy. Next of kin isn\u2019t responsible for outstanding debt of loved ones unless they are a co-signer of a loan or are on a joint account with the now-deceased. If you die, your student loans tend to go with you. With federal student loans, your family isn\u2019t obligated to repay your outstanding debt. If you have private student loans, you might be on the hook for those payments, but many times, those loans are discharged in a similar fashion to federal student loans. If you\u2019re unsure about what happens to your student loans, check your agreement with your loan servicer or contact your lender about what happens to your loans if you die.

            "title": "Student Loan Consolidation vs. Refinancing",
            "content": "Morsa Images / Getty Images Consolidation and refinancing are both ways to change the terms and payment amounts of your loan so that you can pay down your debt faster, manage the loans easier, or save money on interest rates. However, these are distinct strategies that can have entirely different outcomes. Learn how student loan consolidation and refinancing work below. When you consolidate your student loan, you combine all of your federal student loans into one, a direct consolidation loan. Your new interest rate is the weighted average of all your loan interest rates, rounded up to the nearest one-eighth percent. These loans have repayment terms of up to 30 years, and you\u2019ll make one payment every month until your loan is paid in full. Consolidating won\u2019t get you a lower interest rate, but it does make payments more manageable by giving you one monthly payment rather than several. For a lot of federal student loan programs, you may need to consolidate your loans before you can take advantage of them. For instance, if you want to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), you\u2019ll need to consolidate your loans first. Consolidation is only available for federal student loans. Instead of consolidation, private lenders typically allow you to refinance your loans. Streamlined payments Access to federal programs No credit check Longer terms May lose some benefits Pay more in interest Refinancing is when you take out a new private loan to repay all of your other student loans. Refinancing can get you new repayment terms and a new interest rate, and like consolidating, it reduces your number of monthly loan payments to one. To refinance your federal student loans, you\u2019ll choose a private lender first. Make sure you\u2019re eligible based on the lender\u2019s individual requirements, such as minimum or maximum loan amounts, credit history, and/or graduation requirements. Some lenders require you to have a degree before refinancing, while others will refinance your loans before you graduate. Once you compare lenders and pick the one you want, you\u2019ll complete an application. Most lenders conduct a credit check to make sure you\u2019re responsible enough with credit to repay your loan. Most give results right away, but some might have extra requirements you\u2019ll need to meet before approval. There\u2019s no set standard for eligibility across all private student loan lenders. Refinancing your student loan is done only through private lenders. There is no federal student loan refinancing, only consolidation. If you refinance your federal loans into a private loan, you have advantages and disadvantages to consider. Potentially pay debt off sooner Lower your interest rate Reduce your number of monthly payments Lose federal protections Might not get better terms May not qualify Deciding between refinancing and consolidating depends on your individual circumstances. You might want to refinance if: You may want to consolidate if: You don\u2019t have to consolidate or refinance your student loans. You can set up your own repayment plan using a debt snowball or debt avalanche strategy, which helps you tackle repayment by focusing on the smallest debt first or the loan with the largest interest rate. You can also try making additional payments, whether that\u2019s every other week or a few throughout the year; increasing the amount of your monthly payments; or asking your lender to change your due date if it doesn\u2019t work for you. There is no limit to how many times you can refinance a student loan. But every time you refinance to a longer term, you risk paying more in interest and taking longer to repay your loan. A direct consolidation loan takes all your federally eligible student loans and consolidates them. You can\u2019t consolidate private student loans\u2014only federal ones. Refinancing triggers a hard credit check, which temporarily causes your credit score to drop. Your score will rebound after a few months of on-time payments on your new loan. You can change your student loans by either consolidating or refinancing them. The right move for you will depend on your personal circumstances and goals. Weigh the pros and cons of each option and understand all your alternatives before deciding how to handle your student loan debt.

            "title": "Private Student Loans: What They Are, How They Work",
            "content": "Maskot / Getty Images Private student loans are loans taken out for higher education that are offered through third-party providers. They can be used to pay for tuition and fees at two-year colleges, four-year institutions of higher education, trade schools, and other adult education centers, depending on the lender. Private student loans can be offered through banks, credit unions, state agencies, and even schools themselves. They can be fixed-rate loans that are repaid in regular installments or variable-rate loans in which payment amounts can change. Learn more about how private student loans work. Private student loans can differ heavily depending on the lender, and they're typically best used after federal student loans have been exhausted. Private student loans have more flexible maximum loan amounts, including the option to borrow up to the cost of tuition and fees to attend school (minus any financial aid received). Private student loans can come with different repayment terms depending on the lender, but they can often be repaid over 10 to 15 years or longer. Some private student loans also offer interest-only payments for a set period of time or flat payments during school to help keep interest costs at bay. Most private student loans also let students defer payments until after they graduate, although more interest accrues over time for students who go this route. Student loan interest rates vary among private lenders, and the rate that applicants ultimately qualify for can depend on their creditworthiness. This makes private student loans different from most federal student loans, which are available to borrowers regardless of their credit. Where many private student loans feature variable interest rates that can change over time based on market conditions, some private student loans have fixed rates. While private student loans are offered through third-party companies and have more variables as a result, federal student loans are made through the government. This means the terms and conditions of federal student loans remain constant because they're set by law. Federal student loans also come with benefits like fixed interest rates and set repayment schedules, including the possibility of repaying debt with an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. These factors tend to make federal student loans less expensive than private student loans over the long term, especially when students repay their debt using IDR plans that base their monthly payments on their income and family size. The main differences between private and federal student loans are highlighted in the chart below. While federal student loans come with limits that dramatically impact how much students can borrow in each year of school, private student loans can provide larger loan amounts. In fact, many private loans let students borrow up to 100% of the cost of attendance for each year of school, minus any financial aid they receive. Private student loans can come with competitive interest rates that make borrowing for school relatively affordable. However, the best interest rates and loan terms go to borrowers with very good to excellent credit. Students can apply for private student loans online and from the comfort of home. Many private student loan applications can be completed in five minutes or less. Another benefit of private student loans is the fact students can qualify for lower interest rates and better loan terms with a co-signer. This can be especially helpful when the borrower has a parent or another family member with great credit who's willing to co-sign. Private student loans don't give you the chance to qualify for future loan forgiveness via IDR plans, nor do they offer federal deferment or forbearance. If the government is ever able to pass broad student loan forgiveness in the future, there's a good chance it would only apply to federal student loans. Many private student loan options come with variable interest rates that can fluctuate over time based on market conditions. While variable rates can lead to potential savings when interest rates are low, your monthly loan payments could surge in a rising interest rate environment. While most federal student loans are available to borrowers without a credit check, the same cannot be said for private student loans. The best private student loan rates go to borrowers with very good credit or better, and borrowers with imperfect credit pay much higher borrowing costs. Private student loans make the most sense when any of the following applies: Research and compare the best private student loan companies based on their interest rates, repayment options, and loan amounts. Be sure to read over the product pages for loan products you're considering, and check for hidden fees like prepayment penalties or application fees. You can apply for a private student loan online. You should plan to submit information like your full name and address, Social Security number (SSN), monthly income, year of school, the degree you're pursuing, and more. You may also be asked to choose the loan amount you need and your desired repayment plan during the application process. Once you're approved for a private student loan, you can receive the funding in one of two ways. Some lenders will send the loan funds directly to you so you can use them for tuition and fees, whereas others will send the money to your school directly. You may have to make payments on private student loans while you're still in college, although this depends on the lender. To get the most out of your private student loan experience, consider the following: If you need to pay for school but you're not necessarily sold on private student loans, consider these alternatives. Private student loans require a credit check, meaning you have the potential to be denied funding if your credit doesn't meet requirements set by lenders. Even if you have good enough credit to get approved, you can harm your credit score if you make student loan payments late or let your loans go into default. If you borrow responsibly and always make your student debt payments on time, this should help your credit score in the long run. Private student loans don't qualify for the same forgiveness plans as federal student loans. However, private student loan companies may offer plans that can help you keep your loans out of default. Private student loans can definitely be refinanced, and it's a common move to make when rates decrease and better loan options become available. Private student loans offer a way to fund a college degree, but their less favorable terms mean they should only be used once federal student loan limits have been exhausted. Even then, it's important to only borrow what you need with private student loans so you don't wind up with too much student debt. Additionally, make sure the earnings in your future career will justify how much you need to borrow to graduate.

            "title": "Are Parents Liable for Student Loans? Understanding the Financial Responsibilities",
            "content": "FG Trade / Getty Images Parents are not liable for repaying federal student loans taken out by their child, even though families are required to list both the student's and parent's information when filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). However, parents are liable for student loans that they co-sign, including private student loans. There\u2019s also a type of federal student loan, called a parent PLUS loan, that holds parents responsible for repayment since it is taken out by parents in the first place. Whether parents are liable for student loans depends on the type of loan. Federal student loans, parent PLUS loans, and private loans each have different terms regarding financial responsibility. Let\u2019s look at each loan type in more detail. Students who want to borrow for school with federal student loans start the process by filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This form helps the federal government, states, and institutions of higher education determine what kind of federal aid a student is eligible for and how much. Submitting the FAFSA is required if you want federal student loans. Generally, parents are not liable for repaying federal student loans taken on by a student. This includes direct subsidized loans, direct unsubsidized loans, direct PLUS loans made to graduate or professional students, direct consolidation loans, and Perkins loans. Rules are a bit different for parent PLUS loans compared to other federal loans. These federal student loans are taken on by parents of dependent undergraduate students to cover the cost of higher education. Unlike most federal student loans for students, parent PLUS loans require a credit check. The borrowing parent, not the student, is responsible for these loans and they can\u2019t pass that responsibility onto the student when they graduate, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). With private student loans, financial responsibility lies with the person who took out the loans. For example, loans taken out by students on their own are the sole responsibility of the student when it comes to repayment. Since private student loans require a credit check and often have strict requirements for approval, many students need a co-signer to get the funding they need. That's when parents can become liable for repaying student debt. If a student applies for private student loans with a parent as the co-signer, both the student and the parent are financially liable for repayment of the debt. Since many college students haven't established a credit history, having a parent co-sign is a fairly common practice. However, adding a co-signer to a loan has advantages and disadvantages for both the parent and the student. Higher chance of approval Potential for better loan terms Shared responsibility Potential for conflict Parents could be made responsible for debt Impact on parent's credit There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to paying for higher education or sharing expenses. Some parents will want to help pay for school, either through saving for college with a 529 savings plan; covering tuition and fees out of pocket; or borrowing for school with federal student loans, private loans, or both. Parents and students should discuss their expectations and ways they can both work toward a common goal of paying for a college education. For federal student loans, legal consequences for nonpayment are the same for both students and parents who take out parent PLUS loans. For example, late payments can be reported to the credit bureaus and will lower the borrower\u2019s credit score. The government can also collect on unpaid student loans through wage garnishment and seizure of tax refunds or government benefits checks. Legal considerations for private student loans are the same. Private lenders may even sell your unpaid debt to a collection agency, and they may also try to take you to court. Any student can fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which unlocks a range of financial aid options like scholarships, grants, work-study programs, and federal student loans. Both students and their parents need to include their financial and tax information on the FAFSA form, even if the parent doesn't plan to help with college expenses. Interest rates for federal student loans are always fixed, but they do change for new loans originated from one year to the next. For direct loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2023, and before July 1, 2024, the rate for direct subsidized loans and direct unsubsidized loans (undergraduate) is 5.50%. For direct unsubsidized loans for graduate/professional students, the rate is 7.05%, and direct PLUS loans come with a fixed interest rate of 8.05%. If your parent co-signed a private student loan, you can have their name removed by refinancing the loan on your own, if you can get approved. Some student loans also allow for a \"co-signer release,\" which lets students release a co-signer of their financial responsibility for the debt after a set period of time. Parents may or may not be on the hook for repaying student loans. It all depends on the loan type taken out and who ultimately signed the paperwork to borrow money. If a parent takes out a parent PLUS loan or co-signs on a private student loan, however, they\u2019re legally responsible for repayment no matter how long it takes. This is why families should have a plan when it comes to paying for college and repaying any resultant debt. Whether parents want to help cover the cost or believe their child should pay for college on their own, the sooner this important discussion takes place, the better.

            "title": "Paying Off Student Loans vs. Investing: Which Should You Prioritize?",
            "content": "Weigh the benefits of paying off your student loans versus investing FG Trade / Getty Images Investing is an important part of building wealth for the future, but if you have student loans, you may feel like you need to get them paid off before you begin investing. Neither option is inherently better than the other, as the \"right\" one to prioritize will depend on your goals and how comfortable you are having debt. Before you decide between using extra cash to either pay down student loans or invest, you'll want to ensure you fully understand your financial situation. Paying off student loans early can bring peace of mind, in addition to reducing the amount of interest you pay over time. On the other hand, investing works best when you start early and be consistent. The potential returns might outweigh what you're paying in interest. First, think about your financial goals and priorities. Determine whether you want to be debt-free faster or build wealth for the future. Carefully think about which goal makes the most sense for your situation. Perhaps you need to get out of debt to qualify for a mortgage before you save for retirement. Or maybe you're comfortable carrying some debt and want to build an emergency fund to prepare for unexpected expenses first. In some cases, student loan debt can keep you from reaching other goals. By paying it off, you might feel more freedom to make progress in other areas of your life. On the other hand, you might want to build wealth earlier by putting your extra money to work through investing. You may be able to invest and work toward paying off student loans by budgeting portions of your discretionary income for both. Interest is the money you pay to borrow money. Student loan interest rates vary, so some of your loans might have higher rates than others. Even if you consolidate your loans to one interest rate, you're still paying interest. Additionally, interest accrued during your time in school or a deferment or forbearance period will likely be added to your outstanding loan balance. As a result, you're now paying interest on that accrued interest. The faster you pay off your loans, the more money you save in the long run. Let's say you consolidate your federal loans. The formula for determining your interest rate for a loan consolidation considers your balances and statutory interest rates. To calculate your new consolidation loan balance and interest rate, total the balances and average the interest rates of the loans you're consolidating, rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of 1%. Say you have the following undergraduate unsubsidized loans: In this case, a consolidation loan would be for $27,000 and have an interest rate of 4%. If you're concerned about compounding interest and have an interest rate that's high relative to potential returns, repaying student loans might make sense. Inputting your loan term, principal amount, and interest rate into a loan calculator can calculate the total interest expense on different loan types. Paying off debt is often considered a \"guaranteed return\" based on your interest rate. However, what if your potential investment returns are higher than the interest rate on your student loans? In the example above, you're paying 4% on your student loans. However, the long-term average annual return of the S&P 500 is about 10%, more than twice the rate of some student loans. In that case, you might be better off putting more of your discretionary income toward investing since your returns could be much higher than what you'd be paying in interest. Keep in mind that the stock market can be risky and isn't guaranteed to provide returns each year. Before investing, you should know your risk tolerance and time horizon, or how soon you may need access to the invested funds. For example, if you need access to your money in the short term and the market is down when you sell your investments, you may suffer a loss. However, if you don't need the money and have a longer time horizon, you can afford to wait for the market to bounce back before selling your investments. How soon you may need access to your money can help you determine the level of risk you can tolerate and, ultimately, the type of investment, such as stocks, bonds, or certificates of deposit (CDs). Compared to federal loans, private student loans typically have different terms and access to fewer benefits and programs. In that case, you might decide to tackle your private loans first. Then, you may want to address your federal student loans or choose to invest first. If you're not eligible for federal student loan repayment programs, you may also be able to refinance all of your private and federal loans together into one private loan with the same term but at a lower rate. Then, you can reduce your debt faster without paying as much. Carefully consider your financial situation and your future earning potential as you evaluate the types of student loans you have. In many cases, it might be better to not refinance federal and private loans together and pay them down separately. The IRS does not consider money you receive from a student loan as taxable income. You can potentially deduct up to $2,500 of your student loan interest when you prepare your taxes. This can lower your taxable income and reduce how much you owe. In some cases, depending on your rate, the tax deduction might offset a portion of the interest you pay. A quick way to estimate your tax deduction is to multiply the dollar amount of your total interest payments by your tax bracket. For example, if you pay $1,500 in student loan interest during the year and you're in the 22% tax bracket, your deduction is worth $330. That's not enough to fully negate your interest, but you might decide it's enough to adjust how you allocate money for paying off student loans versus investing. Finally, consider whether you're eligible for federal forgiveness programs. Private student loans aren't eligible for forgiveness, but federal loans might be. If you can get a lower monthly payment that frees up more money to invest, and you know you'll get some level of student loan forgiveness, it'll be easier to make building wealth a priority. On July 18, 2024, a federal court blocked the operation of the SAVE plan until court cases centered around the IDR plan can be resolved. In the meantime, the Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into forbearance, whereby they will not need to make payments, nor will interest accrue on their loans.   Options exist for borrowers nearing PSLF. Borrowers can \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if they reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan. You should prioritize paying off student loans early if... Pay less in total interest Peace of mind from paying off debt Better ability to reach other financial goals Opportunity cost with money that's not invested Missing out on potential debt cancelation benefits You can take several steps to pay down your student loan debt more quickly. These include: You might prioritize investing if... Before using all your savings to pay off your student loans, consider your upcoming financial needs, such as rent or mortgage payments. Additionally, you may want to build an emergency fund to protect yourself from large medical bills or other unexpected expenses. Strategies to pay off student loans sooner include paying extra toward the principal by making bi-weekly payments, cutting back on costs, and supplementing your income. Federal student loans offer benefits that private loans don't provide, such as IDR plans, deferment in some cases, and loan forgiveness when certain conditions are met. Additionally, undergraduate student loans have no credit requirements, and interest rates are the same for each loan in a given year. It depends on your plan. The Standard Repayment Plan is 10 years, while some consolidation loans can have a repayment period of up to 30 years. IDR plans offer payoffs of 20 or 25 years, and some forgiveness programs provide earlier cancelation. You can also pay off your loan early using extra payments. Whether you're better off paying down student debt or investing will depend on your situation, financial goals, and how you feel about debt. Additionally, it's important to realize that it's not an either/or situation. You can always invest a portion of your discretionary income while still tackling your student loan debt.

            "title": "Student Loan Forbearance vs. Deferment: What\u2019s the Difference?",
            "content": "Understanding forbearance and deferment can help you choose your best strategy If you're having trouble making your student loan payments, you might be able to receive a temporary pause on repayment. However, it's not as straightforward as you might think. You might need to decide between forbearance and deferment for your student loans. The key difference between the two is that with forbearance your loans will continue to accrue interest, whereas this is less likely to be the case with deferment. Forbearance and deferment are terms used to differentiate between two types of payment adjustments when you have federal student loans. It's important to note that when your loans are in forbearance or deferment, you aren't making progress toward student loan forgiveness. The idea is that you might be able to see a pause or a reduction in your student loan payments if you're struggling to pay the full amount. It's important to understand the difference between forbearance and deferment for student loans because requirements and terms vary depending on the choice you make. Federal student loan deferment is usually connected to a specific event. For example, you can usually get a deferment if you are enrolled in school at least part-time, unemployed, or serving in the military. When you meet the requirements, your student loan servicer must grant you the deferment. Your loans can be deferred for up to three years at a time, with no limits on renewing the deferment as long as you qualify. Some types of federal student loans don't accrue interest during forbearance. These include: Other types of student loans, such as direct unsubsidized loans, direct unsubsidized consolidation loans, and PLUS loans all accrue interest during the deferment. At the end of the deferment period, unpaid interest is capitalized, or added to the loan balance. For the most part, student loan deferment is based on an event that qualifies you to receive a break in student loan payments. Some of the reasons for deferment include: When enrolled in college or graduate school, you should receive deferment automatically. Other deferments, however, require an application. You'll have to call your federal loan servicer or visit its website to get the application and apply based on the qualifying event. In some cases, you may need to provide documentation of the qualifying event. You can find your servicer by logging into your Federal Student Aid account. Federal student loan forbearance is also a way to handle student loan payments when you're struggling. Forbearance can be granted in terms of up to 12 months. You can apply for another forbearance if you're still experiencing hardship after the original term ends. With student loan forbearance, interest accrues on all types of loans. Additionally, forbearance is more discretionary. Your loan servicer might reduce your payments rather than suspend them. Additionally, interest isn't capitalized at the end of your term. You're likely to receive forbearance if you meet some of the following criteria: To receive forbearance, you need to apply through your servicer. Unlike deferment, where you need to select the right application paperwork for your situation, there's only one application for forbearance. While most forbearance is at the servicer's discretion, there are some instances when a servicer is obligated to grant your request. This includes participation in the AmeriCorps, a medical internship, the National Guard, and a few other situations. You might need to provide documentation of your situation. Call your loan servicer or visit its website for more information. In some cases, your servicer can set up your forbearance over the phone. The main difference between deferment and forbearance is the accrual of interest. On certain loans, deferral won't result in interest accrual. With forbearance, however, all loans continue to accrue interest during the period that you're making reduced payments or skipping them. Another key difference is that when you meet the requirements for deferral, your federal loan servicer must grant your request. With forbearance, the servicer has more discretion when granting your request. Neither forbearance nor deferment on your federal student loans will directly impact your credit. In many cases, if you have a long-term financial situation that meets the criteria for deferment for your student loan, it might make sense to go forward. This is especially true if you have subsidized or Perkins loans. If you can avoid interest accrual during your deferment, you won't have to worry about the additional cost of adding interest to your loan balance at the end of your deferment. On the other hand, if you think your financial hardship is likely to be relatively brief, forbearance might make more sense. This is especially true if you know your interest will accrue regardless. It might be a good idea to set up a plan to at least pay the interest on your student loans during forbearance or deferment so that you can minimize the long-term impact of reducing or delaying your student loan payments. You don't always have to make the choice between forbearance and deferment for your student loans. You can turn to another option, such as: Rather than using deferment or forbearance and potentially needing to catch up later, you can take advantage of an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. If you qualify, you might be able to get a payment as low as $0 per month\u2014without the need for forbearance or deferment. Additionally, if you qualify for the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan, your loan won't accrue interest as long as you remain up-to-date on your payments. However, on July 18, 2024, a federal appeals court blocked the SAVE plan pending the resolution of two court cases involving the plan. The Department of Education moved borrowers enrolled in SAVE into an interest-free forbearance while the litigation is ongoing. There are different IDR programs, each with specific term lengths. Additionally, once you start earning more money, you might no longer qualify. You must update your income and renew your IDR plan each year. If you're making several different payments on the Standard Repayment Plan, it can feel overwhelming. Instead of getting deferment or forbearance for each loan, consider consolidating your loans. With a federal direct consolidation loan, everything is put under one loan with one payment. Often, the term is spread out for a longer period of time, so your monthly payments are more manageable. Check to see if you qualify for any student loan forgiveness programs. If you can get a portion\u2014or all\u2014of your loan balance canceled for service as a teacher, healthcare provider, or nonprofit worker, this can reduce your need for forbearance or deferment. Enrolling in an IDR plan can help you reduce your payments while setting you up for cancelation after you meet the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) requirements. It's also possible to refinance your loans privately. If you have good credit, you might be able to get a competitive rate and reduce your payments and loan term. However, it's important to note that if you refinance your federal student loans, you'll no longer be eligible for programs like income-driven repayment, federal deferment and forbearance, PSLF, and other federal debt cancelation programs. Finally, if you don't want to defer your loans or apply for forbearance, you can review your budget and make changes. See if you can cut back on unnecessary expenses and direct more money toward student loan payments. You can also look for ways to increase your income to make repayment more affordable. Private student loans might offer hardship programs, which they may call either deferment or forbearance. However, each program is different and you should talk to your lender about the requirements. It might make sense to at least pay the interest on your loans during deferment or forbearance. If you don't pay your interest during deferment, accrued interest will be capitalized. With forbearance, your interest isn't capitalized, but you still have to begin paying accrued interest after the forbearance period ends. Both deferment and forbearance can be tools that can help you get your budget under control if you're struggling to make your student loan payments. However, before you settle on deferment or forbearance, consider applying for an IDR plan, which can also lower your payments while still allowing you to work toward forgiveness. If you're struggling with your student loan payments, you will likely need to use multiple strategies to manage your situation. Both deferment and forbearance can help provide you with breathing room to make a plan. However, you should consider all of your options before moving forward, including consulting with a financial professional who can help you review your situation and make a plan.

            "title": "Student Loan Refinancing: An Overview",
            "content": "If you\u2019re trying to get a handle on your loans, you may want to refinance your student loan debt. Refinancing can lower your current interest rates, monthly payments, or both.\u00a0Refinancing can also consolidate several payments into one, which can help you more easily manage them. Here\u2019s how to refinance student loan debt as well as how to weigh the pros and cons of refinancing to determine if it's the right move for you. You can refinance your student loans through private banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Each financial institution sets its own eligibility criteria, including its minimum credit score and income requirements. Your credit score is one of the most important factors in determining your eligibility and your potential interest rate. Typically, the higher your score, the lower your interest rate. Lowering your interest rate is a key reason to refinance your student loans, as it can save you money in the long term and reduce your monthly payments. For most lenders, a fair-to-good credit score is required to qualify for a new loan. However, other lenders may offer refinancing opportunities for borrowers with bad credit, although you may have to contend with a higher interest rate. If you don't want to borrow from a bad credit lender but are struggling to improve your score, then working with a credit counseling company may be worth considering. Demonstrating that you have a stable income is also an important factor in student loan refinancing eligibility. Having a job and a reliable salary shows lenders you can make at least the minimum payment every month. Income requirements vary widely between lenders, but you may have to provide details about your employer, job, income, and your role/responsibilities to qualify. If you\u2019re thinking about refinancing your student loans, take these steps to make sure you\u2019re prepared and eligible. Review your current loans, including their amounts, interest rates, repayment terms, and minimum monthly payments. Also make sure you know how much you owe in total, as some lenders have minimum and maximum loan amount requirements for eligibility. Research several different lenders to find loan offerings that meet your needs and requirements. Weigh each option based on interest rates, repayment term options, eligibility criteria, and fees, including late payment penalties. Finally, read reviews to see what other borrowers say about the lenders. After you\u2019ve compared companies, apply for pre-qualification with your chosen lenders (if they offer it). Pre-qualification lets you learn whether you're eligible for refinancing without completing a full application. The terms you're offered aren't guaranteed, but they can give you a good estimate of what you can expect with your loan. You can use pre-qualification to further narrow down which refinancing option is best for you. Whether that\u2019s an offer with shorter repayment terms over longer ones or a variable interest rate rather than a fixed rate, looking at every facet of your options can ensure you\u2019re making the best possible refinancing decision. A pre-qualification doesn\u2019t trigger a hard credit check, so it won\u2019t affect your credit score. Once you\u2019ve narrowed down your choices and selected a lender, you can fill out a full application. You\u2019ll need to have some important information on hand, such as tax returns, employment details, loan details, and more. You may also need to show proof of graduation. The more accurate information you provide upfront, the more likely you are to get results sooner. Most lenders review and will approve (or deny) you right away. After submitting your application, you should get results within a couple of days to a couple of weeks, depending on the lender. Once approved, you\u2019ll share banking information with your lender. Keep making payments on your old loans until your new lender tells you the transfer has been completed, whereafter you\u2019ll start making payments on your refinanced loan. Refinancing your student loans has several advantages, including the possibility of lowering your interest rate or monthly payments, but it does have downsides to consider as well. Depending on the terms of your new loan, you could also pay more in interest, and you\u2019ll lose the federal benefits you may have with your original loan. Typically lower interest rate Typically lower monthly payments Consolidate several payments into one Lose federal benefits Could pay more in interest Potentially higher monthly payments While refinancing is one option to help you manage your student debt loan, you may want to explore other options, including: The amount of time it can take to refinance a student loan will often depend on the lender. It may take a few weeks for a lender to review your financial situation and determine if you qualify for a new loan, or it may take just a few days. Every lender has different requirements for student loan refinancing. While you may need a good credit score to qualify or get the best rates, you might be eligible for refinancing with bad or fair credit with some lenders. Yes, you can refinance your federal student loans. But keep in mind refinancing turns your student loans into private loans, which means you'll likely lose federal benefits, such as the potential to defer payments. There\u2019s technically no limit to how many times you refinance your student loans. But keep in mind that every time you refinance, you\u2019re taking out a new loan. Applying for new credit can temporarily lower your credit score. If you are refinancing to extend the term of your loan to lower payments, you may be increasing the total amount you pay in interest. Calculate your savings and costs with each refinance to determine if it\u2019s the right choice for you. When you refinance, you\u2019ll complete a loan application, which triggers a hard credit check and causes your credit score to dip. The impact on your credit is temporary, and your score usually rebounds within a few months. Student loan refinancing is one option to help you manage a large student loan debt, which provides benefits like a lower interest rate or lower monthly payments. Be sure to calculate your potential costs and savings to see if refinancing your student loan debt is the right call for your situation. Don't forget to also weigh the potential downsides as you consider whether to refinance, including the possibility of losing your federal benefits.

            "title": "How Much Would It Cost to Cancel Student Debt?",
            "content": "While the Biden administration has already canceled almost $168.5 billion in student loan debt, the President has plans for further debt cancellation.. However, debt cancellation does come at a price to taxpayers. If all student loan debt is forgiven, it would cost taxpayers an estimated $1.6 trillion. There are a few different proposals for student debt cancellation, with both the Biden administration as well as several members of Congress offering possible solutions. President Joe Biden has canceled nearly $169 billion in student loan debt since taking office. The Biden-Harris administration planned to accelerate its recently developed Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. Borrowers currently enrolled in the income-driven repayment (IDR) plan for their federal student loans who originally took out $12,000 or less to pay for college and have been repaying for at least 10 years could have their remaining loans forgiven. However, recent federal rulings have blocked key aspects of the SAVE plan, putting student loan debt cancellation for borrowers on hold. On July 18, 2024, a federal appeals court blocked the SAVE plan until two court cases centered around the IDR plan can be resolved. The Department of Education has moved the approximately 8 million borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into an interest-free forbearance while the litigation is ongoing. It has also outlined options for borrowers who were nearing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)\u2014borrowers can either \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if they reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan. Private student loans aren't typically eligible for forgiveness, so it's important to take advantage of as much federal student aid as you can get. Ideally, you should only use private student loans to fill any remaining funding gaps after you've exhausted all possible sources of federal aid. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), alongside several other senators, wants President Biden and the U.S. Department of Education to expand the relief for student loans. She's proposed the following: Student loan debt has risen to nearly $1.6 trillion. While less than 1% of that debt is more than 90 days delinquent, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York expects that number to grow at the end of 2024. This is when federal student loan delinquencies will start to be reported to the credit bureaus. Borrowers who become delinquent on their student loans will see their credit scores take a hit. If you're struggling to bring your credit score back up after missing student loan payments, you may want to consider working with a reputable credit counseling service. While total student loan debt in the U.S. is still less than total mortgage debt ($12.90 trillion), it\u2019s also still more than total credit card debt ($1.14 trillion). That means borrowers have higher student loan balances than credit card balances. Essentially, student loan debt is the largest non-mortgage debt in the U.S. Most borrowers are repaying federal student loans, which is about $37,852.80 per borrower. Even though President Biden has been able to cancel billions of dollars in student debt, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down his original cancellation plan in 2023. If it had gone through, it would\u2019ve cost taxpayers an estimated $330 billion to $390 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. If all federal loans are forgiven for all 43 million borrowers, it would cost about $1.6 trillion. If you have student loan debt, canceling student loan debt likely seems like a good idea, as it would let you and other borrowers put money toward paying for necessities, saving for retirement, or discretionary expenses. But if you didn\u2019t have any student loan debt or already paid yours off, you may feel that taxpayers shouldn't be responsible for paying off other people's student debt. If all student loan debt is forgiven, it would cost taxpayers upwards of $1.6 trillion. A plan proposed by President Biden, which was later struck down by the Supreme Court, would have cost taxpayers an estimated $330 billion to $390 billion. By default, student loans aren't forgiven after any amount of time. However, for borrowers who qualify for an IDR plan, any remaining balance on their loans will be forgiven after 20 or 25 years (depending on the plan) of on-time payments. Canceling student debt can have its upsides, especially for folks who can\u2019t pay for the things they need, whether that\u2019s housing, food, or basic utilities. With nearly $1.6 trillion in student loan debt, those who have their federal loans forgiven can put those funds back into the economy. But canceling student loan debt can also negatively impact other folks, costing Americans roughly $1.6 trillion to cancel all outstanding student loan debt.

            "title": "How to Get a Mortgage While Managing Student Loan Debt",
            "content": "Tips for buying a home when you have student loan debt To get a mortgage while managing your student loan debt, you will need to make sure your finances are strong enough to be approved for one. This may mean saving up for a substantial deposit or ensuring your earnings can cover both your student loan payments and mortgage payments, among other steps. By also choosing a lender with a track record of working with borrowers carrying student debt, your application may stand a better chance of being approved. Having student loan debt can affect whether you are in a good financial position to buy a house. Making student loan payments on top of mortgage payments can be a financial strain. In fact, many millennials point to student loan debt as a major reason that they've delayed buying a home. Every $1,000 in student loan debt delays homeownership by about four months. according to one Federal Reserve Board study. Student loan debt affects buying a house by reducing the amount of available funds you have available for a down payment as well as housing payments. As such, mortgage lenders are less likely to approve you when you carry more debt and offer a lower down payment. Student loan debt is included in the debt that is used to calculate your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. This is the total amount of your monthly debt payments compared to your monthly income. If you're on an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan and can show the monthly amount of that lower payment, you might be able to lower your DTI as a result. Keep in mind that lenders might use a different formula if you have loans in forbearance or deferral. For example, you might not be making payments now, but the lender might want to figure out how to calculate your DTI for the future to ensure you can afford the mortgage. The lender has two options if your loans are in forbearance or deferral, according to guidelines from Fannie Mae. Your monthly student loan payment will be added to your other debts, such as monthly credit card payments or car loans. If your student loan payment has made your DTI ratio too high, you might be denied a loan. As you consider the home-buying process, there are strategies you can use to manage your student loan debt and make it easier to qualify for a mortgage. If you're having a hard time saving up for a down payment for a home, you might be able to ease your monthly cash flow by applying for an IDR plan. If you qualify, you might be able to get a lower student loan payment, which would free up some money in your budget that can be put toward saving for a down payment. Another strategy is to pursue student loan forgiveness or cancellation, though this isn't always an option with private student loans. Depending on your situation and your profession, you might be able to get at least a partial cancellation of your debt. Some potential programs include: Having your student loans forgiven can reduce your total debt. In turn, your credit score and DTI ratio will likely improve, which will increase your chances of getting approved for a mortgage. In general, student loan debt is treated much the same as other types of debt for mortgage approval purposes. For \"qualified mortgages,\" such as those backed by the federal government, you'll generally need below a 43% DTI. However, some lenders might allow a higher DTI. Lenders will also take into account other criteria, such as: If you're looking for government-backed programs, like a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan or VA loan, the lender may still adhere to the 43% DTI limit. The good news with these loans, however, is that you might qualify for a loan with a lower down payment and some more flexible credit terms. When buying a home with student loan debt, much of the process is similar to buying a home without student loan debt. Before you begin the process, shop around and compare different lenders. Check if pre-approval is an option so you'll have a sense of how much you can borrow. Pre-approvals do not impact your credit score, as they do not require a hard credit inquiry. Consider getting help from a buyer's real estate agent. In some cases, a buyer's agent comes at no cost to you, so the seller will end up paying the commission. A good buyer's agent can help you negotiate terms and is likely to act in your best interest. You can also get help navigating the closing process, including arranging for inspections and title insurance. Most student loan borrowers have less than $25,000 of their own student loan debt. In total, Americans owed $1.7 trillion in student loan debt as of the third quarter of 2023. How much debt is too much when you're buying a house will depend on your income and other assets. It will also depend on other financial factors like the amount of debt you have. For qualifying mortgages, your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio should be no more than 43%. There's no requirement to pay off your student loans before buying a house. To decide whether you should buy a home while you have student loan debt, review your comfort level and if you feel you can afford to make mortgage payments on top of student loan payments. It's possible to buy a home when you have student loan debt, but it's important to understand how your monthly payments impact your DTI. Lenders will consider your total financial situation when deciding whether to approve you for a loan. Carefully consider your financial goals and situation and determine if it makes sense for you to buy a home when you're trying to manage student loans.

            "title": "How to Calculate Debt-to-Income Ratio for Student Loans",
            "content": "Your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio is one of the factors lenders consider when making decisions about whether to approve you for a student loan or how much you can borrow. This ratio is calculated by dividing how much you pay in regular debt payments, including your student loan payments, by your gross monthly income. A debt-to-income (DTI) ratio is a factor used to describe how much debt a consumer has compared to their income. It\u2019s usually expressed as a percentage. Lenders use this factor to assess your ability to manage your total monthly payments and whether you could reliably repay the money you plan to borrow. A higher DTI ratio shows that you have a lot of debt to manage each month compared to how much you earn, which tells lenders you are a high-risk borrower. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) recommends maintaining a DTI ratio of 36% or less if you plan to apply for a mortgage. However, it's noted that some mortgage lenders will approve borrowers with DTIs of 43% or higher, including the monthly housing payment. To figure out your DTI ratio, you'll add up all the monthly debt payments you owe and divide the total of those debts by your gross monthly income. The result of this calculation is a decimal number, which you'll multiply by 100 to turn the number into a percentage. Monthly bills that count for the purpose of calculating your DTI ratio include regular bills and other payments you have to make. This means that required monthly expenses count toward DTI, while discretionary purchases you make each month don't count against you. Bills that can count toward DTI each month include: You'll also need to determine your gross monthly income to calculate your DTI. Keep in mind that this factor includes all the money you earn each month before taxes and other deductions are taken from your pay. Funds that can count toward gross monthly income include: Take the following steps to calculate your DTI ratio: Consider this example: Imagine you currently earn $7,000 per month and that you would have $3,800 in monthly debt payments to make if you included the new payment on a home you want to buy, plus other bills and expenses. In that scenario, you would determine your DTI with the following calculation: 3,800 / 7,000 = 0.54285 * 100 = 54.285% This means your DTI ratio would be just a smidge over 54%, which is higher than most mortgage lenders would accept. However, if you found a more affordable home to purchase that would result in monthly debt payments of $2,800, the DTI calculation drops to a more acceptable range of 40%: $2,800 / $7,000 = 0.4 * 100 = 40% Ideally, you want to keep your DTI below 36% even though some mortgage lenders will approve borrowers with a DTI of 43% or higher. Either way, here's a rundown of different debt-to-income ratio ranges and what each one means: If your DTI ratio is too high because of your current student loan debt and monthly payments, there are some steps you can take to lower it. Consider the following strategies specifically for your student loans. If your student loans have a high monthly payment that is causing your DTI to be higher than it could be, you can consider refinancing or consolidating your loans to switch up your monthly payment amount. Just remember that there are downsides that come with refinancing federal student loans with a private lender, including the loss of federal protections like deferment and forbearance. If you have federal student loans, you can also look at the available repayment plans and choose a better option. This move can be especially helpful for your DTI if you have a high student loan payment on the standard 10-year repayment plan. By opting for an extended repayment plan for federal loans, for example, you can stretch out payments for up to 25 years and secure a lower monthly payment in the process. There are also income-driven repayment (IDR) plans for federal student loans that base your monthly payment on your income and family size. For many people whose incomes are on the lower end, moving to an IDR plan can mean owing $0 toward student loans each month. The Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan features a higher income exemption for student loan payments than other Income-Driven Repayment plan (IDR) plans. According to the U.S. Department of Education, single people with an income of $32,800 or less have a discretionary income of $0 under this plan, thus they qualify for a $0 monthly payment. For a family of four with an annual income of $67,500 or less, your income will also be $0 under the plan. On July 18, 2024, a federal court blocked the operation of the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan until court cases centered around the income-driven repayment (IDR) plan can be resolved. In the meantime, the Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into forbearance, whereby they will not need to make payments, nor will interest accrue on their loans.For those nearing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)\u2014you can either \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if you reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan. Having a high DTI ratio can make you seem like a risky bet to lenders. For this reason, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) recommends keeping your DTI below 36%. Borrowers with student loans can decrease their DTI ratio by moving their student loans to a new payment plan or refinancing. In either case, they will only improve their DTI if the move qualifies them for a lower monthly payment than what they're currently paying. A DTI ratio is used by lenders when deciding whether to approve someone for a loan. This means having a high DTI can make it more difficult to qualify for a mortgage and other types of financing, whereas a low DTI can improve your chances of approval. A DTI ratio is an important factor when it comes to key lending decisions, but it's not the only one. You'll also want to keep your credit score in good shape and maintain regular employment if you want to qualify for a mortgage and other types of loans with the best rates and terms. If your current DTI is harming you financially, you also have several options for managing your student loans at your disposal. These include refinancing or choosing a new repayment plan that leads to a lower monthly payment, thus reducing your DTI.

            "content": "Klaus Vedfelt / GettyImages Some loans are better for your finances than others. \u201cGood debt\u201d includes funding that puts you in a better financial situation in the long run, while \u201cbad debt\u201d leads to credit problems. Student loans are typically considered good debt because a higher education can lead to the career or income you want. Good debt can include any debt that pays off in the long run, although the potential benefits that can come from good debt will vary. For example, a mortgage used to buy a home is typically considered good debt since the property itself is an asset that can appreciate in value over time. Small business loans can also be considered good debt when the funds are used to launch a new company or increase profits for an existing business. You can determine if the debt you're considering will be good or bad for your financial situation based on whether you can repay it and how it will help you. Some debt may be good for one borrower but damaging for another. For example, a mortgage for a home you cannot afford would not be good debt, nor would a business loan in which you misspent the loan funds. Student loans are a type of funding that's used to pay for a higher education at a college, university, trade school, or other institution. The reasons student loans are generally considered good debt can include: Student loan debt is typically considered good debt for many reasons, but there are potential downsides as well. They include: Borrowing money gives you the chance to earn a college degree Educational attainment leads to much higher earnings You qualify for subsidized student loans, which means the government covers interest charges while you're in school You shop around to find a degree program with a solid ROI You build credit with on-time student loan payments You borrow more than you need to earn a degree Your chosen degree has a low ROI You struggle to make student loan payments, and your credit is damaged as a result The school you attend is overly expensive without any added benefit How you manage debt can also impact whether your student loans will be worth it. These tips can help you use debt to your advantage.  Please note that on July 18, 2024, a federal court blocked the operation of the SAVE plan until court cases centered around the IDR plan can be resolved. In the meantime, the Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into forbearance, whereby they won't need to make payments, nor will interest accrue on their loans.   Options exist for borrowers nearing PSLF. Borrowers can \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if they reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan. On-time payments on student loans help you build credit over time. Meanwhile, late or missed payments can cause damage to your credit score that could take years to fix. Student loan debt can have many long-term financial consequences that vary from person to person. For example, owing too much on student loans each month can make it more difficult to borrow money for other purposes, such as buying a home or a car. Large student loan payments can also make it difficult for consumers to save for retirement and other future goals. Bad debt can include any debt with a high interest rate or a variable rate, in addition to debts that are not secured by any collateral. Credit card debt is considered bad debt for both of these reasons. Because interest rates on student loans are much lower on average than you'll pay with credit cards, you should pay off credit card debt first to save more on interest in the long run. If you stop making payments on student loans, your lender will report the missed payments to the credit bureaus. Your credit score will suffer as a result, which can make it more difficult to borrow money in the future. If you remain in default on your student loans, the government can eventually garnish your wages, your tax refund, and other government payments you receive. Student loan debt can be good debt when it helps you get where you need to be, either by advancing in your chosen profession, helping you earn more money or both. Remember that not all college degrees lead to success, and you should always strive to borrow as little as possible.

            "title": "How to Settle Your Student Loan Debt: A Step-by-Step Guide",
            "content": "If you can't make your student loan payments, you will not likely have them discharged as part of a bankruptcy proceeding\u2014unless you can show undue hardship. Another option for your unmanageable student loan debt might be a compromise or settlement. In order to secure a student debt settlement, you'll have to negotiate with your lender or servicer, either on your own or with the help of a debt relief company. The exact requirements will vary depending on whether you're trying to settle federal or private student debt. Student loan debt settlement is a process by which your lender agrees to accept less than you owe on your student loan to close your account. For those who can't make student loan payments but don't meet the necessary conditions for bankruptcy discharge, settlement might be an option. You can pay a smaller amount and potentially set up more manageable payments. With private lenders, student loan debt settlement depends on your lender's individual policies. For federal student loans, the United States Department of Education refers to the process as a compromise, and you normally need to be in default. Before moving forward with the debt settlement process, evaluate your financial situation. In some cases, especially with federal student loans, you might be able to get on an income-driven plan with a more manageable monthly payment, including $0 per month. If you're already in default with your federal or private loans, reach out to your servicer or lender to find out what their requirements for settlement might be. Review your income and expenses, and make sure to note extenuating circumstances, such as a major loss of income or hardship due to medical costs or disability. Understanding your current situation, including where your money is coming from and where it's going, can help you establish hardship. Next, gather any documentation you have to support your case for debt settlement. Some of this documentation, if applicable, might include: Depending on the types of student loans you have, you might have different options for student loan debt settlement. Private lenders set their own rules, so you might need to contact them separately to find out what programs they offer. Some might accept a large lump sum, while others might require a new payment plan. With federal student loans, you first have to consider whether using an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan might work as well as a settlement. In order to use an IDR plan, however, you need to make sure you're out of default. If you haven't made a payment in 270 days, your loans are considered in default. To get out of default, you have some standard options with federal student loans: You can also submit your own compromise with a lower payment than the standard compromise. However, your proposal needs to be approved by the Department of Education. You can also reach out to the Office of the Ombudsman for Federal Student Aid to get more information and potentially get help figuring out what you might qualify for. When submitting a compromise, you generally need to have a large sum of funds available, since these compromises usually involve a lump sum in place of an ongoing payment plan. As you go through the process of negotiating your student loan debt settlement, it's important to follow these steps: Once you agree to a settlement, get it in writing. Basic information that should be specified in the settlement agreement includes: Consider having a lawyer review the settlement agreement before signing it. Once you sign the settlement agreement, it's important to fulfill the terms as agreed. If you miss your agreed-upon payments or don't make the lump sum by the required date, you could be liable for the full amount again. When you complete the terms of the settlement, insist on the paid-in-full statement, so you have it for your records and can use it in the event that someone else tries to collect on the debt. If you go forward with a student loan settlement, you should understand the potential impact on your finances. In general, by the time you reach the student loan debt settlement stage, chances are that you've missed payments and your credit score has already been severely impacted. A debt settlement can lower your score even further and can remain on your credit report for up to seven years. A debt settlement will make it harder for you to get a loan later, and you will likely be stuck with interest rates on the loans you do get approved for. Depending on the lender, you might receive a Form 1099-C, which represents the cancellation of debt. If you receive this form, there's a chance that the difference between what you owed and what you paid as part of the settlement will be considered taxable income. Yes, you can negotiate a settlement with your lender or servicer. However, if you are submitting a compromise for federal student loan debt, the Department of Education might need to approve it. The cost of student loan debt settlement depends on various factors, including your principal and interest, in addition to any fees that have accumulated. If you hire a lawyer or other professional to assist you, the cost will increase. If you don't pay your student loans, your delinquency and/or default can be reported to credit agencies and result in a lower credit score. Private lenders can send your account to collections or sue you. For federal student loans, your wages can be garnished, your tax refund seized, and you might be unable to get other federal benefits later. You might be able to talk to your lender or servicer about forbearance or deferment if you think will be able to get back on track later. For federal loans, you can also consider an income-driven repayment plan and, if applicable, use the Fresh Start program to get out of default. While you don't need a lawyer when negotiating a student loan debt settlement, it might make sense to hire one to help you review the terms and ensure that you understand what you're agreeing to. If student loan debt is keeping you from reaching your goals, debt settlement may seem attractive. However, it can be difficult to get approved for a student loan debt settlement. Instead, it might make more sense to work with your server or lender to see if there are hardship options available. Especially with federal student loans, various IDR plans might help you avoid the need for settlement while still resulting in manageable payments. Carefully consider your situation and run the numbers to see if settlement is truly the right path for you. Review other options that might work better for your circumstances, including discharge if you have highly extenuating circumstances.

            "title": "How Long Does It Take to Pay Off Student Loan Debt?",
            "content": "Tom Werner / GettyImages For the most part, how long it takes to pay off student loan debt depends on the type of loans you have and the repayment plan you choose. Other factors like the loan amount and interest rate can also play a role in your timeline for getting out of debt. While federal student loans feature repayment plans that last from 10 to 30 years, repayment options for private student loans vary widely. Read on to learn how long it typically takes to get rid of student debt, your repayment plan options, and how to get out of student debt faster. Federal student loan terms can range from 10 to 30 years, but they default to a standard 10-year repayment plan if you don\u2019t choose another option. The standard 10-year repayment plan can result in higher monthly payments on student loans, so many borrowers choose repayment options with longer terms. The average borrower with student loans spent 21.1 years paying them back, according to a study from One Wisconsin Institute. When you choose a longer student loan repayment period, you will owe more in total interest over the long term. Many factors can play a role in how long it takes to get out of student loan debt, including the length of your repayment plan, your loan amount, interest rates, and your income. Let\u2019s look in more detail at how these factors affect how long it takes for you to pay off your student loan. A major determinant of how long it takes to pay off student loans is the type of payment plan you choose. For federal student loans, repayment options start at 10 years and can be as long as 30 years. For private student loans, repayment terms vary depending on the lender\u2019s policies and offerings. How much student loan debt you have can also impact how long it takes you to get out of debt, depending on how much you can afford. After all, if you carry higher loan amounts with higher monthly payments, you will have less spending money. If you're on a tight budget, you may not be able to make extra payments to pay off your loan sooner. Interest rates also increase the total cost of your loan and the amount of your monthly payments. So a loan with a higher interest rate can take you longer to pay off, depending on your income and budget. In recent years, interest rates have been on the rise for student loans. For federal student loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2023, and before July 1, 2024, the rates were: If you have a high income, you are more likely to have more spending money in your budget that can allow you to make extra payments toward your loan. Paying more toward your principal than the minimum amount will reduce both the amount of total interest you owe and the total time it takes to repay a loan. Student loans, whether they are federal or private, don't have prepayment penalties. You can make extra payments or pay off your loan in full at any time without charge. The standard 10-year repayment plan for federal student loans has a fixed interest rate and a fixed monthly payment. This repayment option for federal student loans is the default option unless you choose a different plan. A graduated repayment plan typically lasts for 10 years (or up to 30 years for consolidation loans), and it starts monthly payments off lower at first. From there, monthly payments increase incrementally, usually every two years. The extended repayment plan lasts for 25 years and can have fixed payments or graduated payments that increase over time. You must have more than $30,000 in outstanding direct loans or Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL) loans to qualify. You can also choose among several types of income-driven repayment (IDR) plans if you have federal student loans. These plans have you pay a percentage of your discretionary income for a set period of time, after which any remaining loan balances are forgiven. IDR plans base monthly payments on factors like income and family size, so payments can be more affordable. The chart below shows how monthly payments work with each type of income-driven repayment option. Introduced in 2023, the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan lowers borrower monthly payments to 5% of discretionary income for undergraduate school loans from the 10% required for other income-driven plans. Additionally, individuals with incomes of up to 225% of the federal poverty limit based on family size can qualify for a $0 monthly payment on their student loans. However, the SAVE plan is currently on hold pending legislative action. On July 18, 2024, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay preventing the plan from functioning as intended until a final rule can be made. Student borrowers currently enrolled in the plan will be placed in an administrative forbearance until the matter is settled. Private student loan lenders set interest rates and repayment plans independently. This means your repayment term with a private student loan company depends on what they offer and which option you select. That said, it's common to find private student loans with repayment terms of up to 15 years or more. Because many borrowers refinance their loans with a private lender to get out of debt as soon as possible, however, you can also find private student loans with terms as short as five years. If you want to pay off student debt faster, you can consider using one or more of the following strategies: You may be inclined to pay down student debt as soon as possible, but there are situations when putting your money to other uses may be a better financial move. For example, you may want to put your money toward saving for a down payment on a house to begin building a real estate asset. Alternatively, you may invest it to try to achieve greater returns than the interest you\u2019re paying on your student loan. Consider this example of how repayment through the SAVE program could work, and how payments would compare to a standard 10-year repayment plan: Imagine you have $25,000 in undergraduate student loans, an interest rate of 5%, and an annual income of $38,000. With the SAVE plan, the monthly payment would be $43 for 20 years, after which the remaining loan balances would be forgiven. Provided your income and monthly payment didn't change, you would pay $10,320 in total toward your loan over 20 years (240 months). At that point, the remaining loan balances would be forgiven, although you may owe income taxes on forgiven amounts. In contrast, paying off the same loan with the same interest rate on the standard 10-year repayment plan would result in a $256.16 monthly payment over that timeline. You would pay a total of $31,820 toward your student loans over 120 months, which includes interest. The amount of student debt can impact your monthly payment on various repayment plans. Many borrowers with high loan amounts opt for repayment plans with longer terms to secure a lower monthly payment on their student loans. Federal student loans come with several repayment options, including the standard 10-year repayment, extended repayment, graduated repayment, and IDR plans. Borrowers who want to get out of student loan debt faster have several strategies at their disposal. They can choose a shorter repayment plan for their loans to begin with, pay more than the minimum each month, or refinance their student loans to switch up their repayment term. Use a student loan repayment calculator to estimate your savings with different strategies. How long it takes to pay off student loan debt will vary based on how much debt you owe, your interest rate, and the repayment plan. This means you have a lot of control over how long it takes to get out of debt, although you will be limited by your income and budget. Some borrowers will be better off paying down student loans as fast as possible, whereas others will benefit more from an IDR plan with a more affordable monthly payment. Consider all your options for paying down debt so you can pay off student loans on a timeline that works for you.

            "content": "With so many different ways to pay for college, students and families may have a hard time trying to decipher which loan options are best for them. After scholarships, grants, as well as subsidized and unsubsidized loans, students can apply for other types of aid. Two options available to prospective students are Parent PLUS loans and private student loans; here's how to weigh the pros and cons of each before making a decision. Parent PLUS loans are federal loans available to parents of dependent, undergraduate students. That means the parents are responsible for payments and loan management on behalf of the child who is benefitting from the loan funds. You might want to get a Parent PLUS loan if: Private student loans are school loans coming from private institutions, like banks, credit unions, and online lenders. You may want to choose private student loans if: In most cases, it\u2019s best for a student to take out a student loan as long as they are aware of the risks and requirements that come with borrowing money. If you\u2019ve exhausted all your federal options as a student and your parent has the tools and financial resources to help, they might take out a Parent PLUS loan for you or co-sign a private student loan with you. The best student loan is the one that provides the right amount of funds to cover education-related expenses, comes with the lowest interest rate available, and provides affordable monthly payments after you leave school. A Parent PLUS loan is a type of federal student loan that is taken out by the parent of a dependent, undergraduate student. Whether a Parent PLUS loan or a private student loan is the right fit for you or your child will depend on your needs and financial circumstances. Generally speaking, a Parent PLUS loan is worth taking out if you're eligible and have exhausted all other conventional means of paying for college. However, if you still need funds and have no federal student aid options left, then a private personal loan is worth considering for a student.

            "content": "Vladimir Vladimirov / Getty Images Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans are federal student loan repayment plans that are based around what you can afford to pay and your income. If you\u2019re trying to lower your federal student loan payments, you may want to explore different income-driven repayment plans. Income-driven repayment plans, or IDR plans, allow federal student loan borrowers to make payments based on their family size and a percentage of their discretionary income. Borrowers are automatically enrolled in the standard repayment plan following a six-month grace period after leaving school. However, you can request a different repayment program at any time, including one of the four IDR plans. Each income-driven repayment plan requires you to make repayments that range from 5% to 20% of your discretionary income, depending on the plan you choose. Discretionary income is based on family size and must be updated annually. If your income is low enough, your monthly payment under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan could be $0. You won't be obligated to make payments and it won\u2019t impact your repayment timeline or credit score. After 20 or 25 years, any remaining balance on your loan is forgiven. For smaller balances under the SAVE plan, forgiveness could be granted in as little as 10 years. The government offers four income-driven repayment plans. They are: In August 2023, the Biden administration launched the SAVE plan. Borrowers previously enrolled in the Revised Pay As You Earn Repayment (REPAYE) plan have been automatically switched over to this newer plan.\u00a0There are some big differences in how the SAVE plan works compared to other IDR plans. For example: On July 18, 2024, a federal appeals court blocked the SAVE plan until two court cases centered around the IDR plan can be resolved. The Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into an interest-free forbearance while the litigation is ongoing. It has also outlined options for borrowers who were nearing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)\u2014borrowers can either \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if they reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan. To qualify for IDR plans, you\u2019ll need to be current on your loans. Each individual IDR plan has its own set of further eligibility requirements that you\u2019ll need to meet to qualify for that specific plan. Income amounts vary based on the IDR plan that you\u2019re interested in. For instance, IBR and PAYE plans require your payments\u2014which are based on your income\u2014to be less than the standard repayment plan if you were to repay your loans within 10 years. Completing an application for income-driven repayment does not trigger a hard credit check and won\u2019t cause your credit score to drop. If you miss payments or are late on your student loans\u2014through IDR or otherwise\u2014then your credit score could decrease. Income-driven repayment lasts up to 20 or 25 years, depending on which IDR plan you\u2019re on. After that, the remaining balance is forgiven. With federal student loans, you have a lot of different repayment options, both based on your income and otherwise. Making payments based on your income and family size through an IDR plan means you pay what you can, not necessarily what your lender decides is appropriate. If you\u2019re thinking about enrolling in an IDR plan, visit StudentAid.gov and see which ones you\u2019re eligible for. If you\u2019re unsure what you might qualify for, use the estimator and input your loan and income details to see different payment options.

            "content": "This program replaces the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) plan and lowers monthly loan payments FluxFactory / Getty Images The Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan is an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan for student loan borrowers. The plan sets monthly payments at 5% to 10% of discretionary income and provides forgiveness for loan balances after 20 or 25 years. Under a new formula for calculating discretionary income, an estimated 1 million low-income borrowers would qualify for a $0 monthly student loan payment. Here are more details about how this plan works. On July 18, 2024, a federal court blocked the operation of the SAVE plan until court cases centered around the IDR plan can be resolved. In the meantime, the Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into forbearance, whereby they will not need to make payments, nor will interest accrue on their loans.   Options exist for borrowers nearing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Borrowers can \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if they reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan. The Biden administration introduced the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan in August 2023. The IDR replaces the\u00a0Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) plan. REPAYE borrowers are automatically enrolled in the SAVE plan without needing to take any action, while borrowers enrolled in other payment plans can switch at the\u00a0Federal Student Aid website\u00a0or by contacting their student loan service provider. Like other IDR plans, SAVE calculates payments based on a borrower\u2019s income and family size. This new plan has the lowest monthly payment requirement of any IDR plan and is available to anyone with a direct loan in good standing. Features of the SAVE plan include: Because SAVE is similar to other IDR plans, you don\u2019t have to take too many additional steps to sign up. Once enrolled, your payments could be cut in half (compared to other IDR plans), and in some cases, you might not need to make any payments at all. Whereas other IDR plans require payments of 10% to 20% of\u00a0discretionary income, under SAVE, this is set to 5% for undergraduate loans. If you have\u00a0graduate loans, the monthly payment is up to 10% of discretionary income or the weighted average of your student loan balances. There\u2019s an extended\u00a0grace period\u00a0from Oct. 1, 2023, to Sept. 30, 2024, which ensures that borrowers who miss payments won\u2019t see any damage to their credit scores or loan status. So you won\u2019t have to worry about\u00a0defaulting\u00a0on your student loan debt during this time. The White House estimates the typical four-year public university borrower will save nearly $2,000 a year with the SAVE plan, and 85% of community college borrowers are expected to be debt-free within 10 years. Because SAVE is replacing the REPAYE plan, it\u2019s important to look at the differences between the two and how each would impact your student debt repayment: Source: Federal Student Aid On June 30, 2023, the Supreme Court struck down the Biden administration's plan to forgive up to $20,000 in student loan debt per borrower.\u00a0The White House responded by introducing the SAVE plan. While this plan is not the broad debt forgiveness many were hoping for, all borrowers currently in\u00a0repayment\u00a0are eligible for the SAVE plan. However, on July 18, 2024, a federal court blocked the SAVE plan from operating until the resolution of pending legal cases. In the meantime, SAVE plan borrowers have been placed in forbearance. The SAVE plan isn\u2019t student loan forgiveness but functions similarly to other IDR plans. After a set amount of time, borrowers will have the balance of their student loans forgiven. For some, that can be as soon as 10 years or as many as 25 years, depending on your balance and the type of loans you\u2019re repaying. Paying off your loans early can save you more money on the total interest paid in the long run. The sooner you pay off your student loans, the more money you can put back into your pocket. Even though the Supreme Court struck down President Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness plan, the new IDR plan\u2014SAVE\u2014was the administration\u2019s backup plan. SAVE adjusts what borrowers will need to repay based on how much they earn. Instead of paying over 10% of your discretionary income toward your student loans, you could pay anywhere from 5% to 10%. Your monthly payments could be cut in half, which would help you save money for other expenses in the long run. While it\u2019s not complete forgiveness, borrowers on the SAVE plan can expect forgiveness in as little as 10 years, depending on how much they owe. However, given the federal court's decision on July 18, 2024, to block the SAVE plan, borrowers must first wait for the pending legal cases to be resolved.

            "title": "Which Student Loans Should I Pay Off First?",
            "content": "How to decide which student loan to tackle first As you decide which student loan to pay off first, consider taking a look at the types of loans you have. If you have private loans, you might consider starting with that debt. On the other hand, some federal student loans have higher interest rates, so you might feel more comfortable tackling those first. As you consider how to proceed with student loan repayment, there are several important factors to consider: The type of student loans you have can impact how you decide which loan to pay off first. Your first consideration is whether you have federal student loans, private student loans, or a mix of both. Federal student loans are standardized, and the terms depend on what type of loan you have and when you took it out. Each year, a fixed interest rate is set for each type of federal student loan based on a formula provided by Congress. Here are some of the federal loan types and their general repayment terms: Private student loans have different repayment terms and interest rates, depending on your lender. If you have multiple private loans, it\u2019s also possible to refinance them into one loan. With refinancing, you replace multiple smaller loans with one bigger loan. This simplifies your private loan payments, similar to how loan consolidation can help with your federal student debt. Next, pay attention to the interest rates you have: Fixed rates offer a reliable payment that can fit into your budget. If you have a loan with a variable payment, it may make more sense to start with that debt before rates begin increasing. Alternatively, it might be better to refinance to a loan with a fixed rate if possible. Another option is to start with the loan that has the highest interest rate. By paying down the loan with the highest interest rate, you have a better chance to get rid of the most expensive debt first so that overall interest accrues at a slower rate. Before deciding which student loan to pay off first, don\u2019t forget to consider other types of debt you have. For example, starting with high-interest credit card debt might make more sense before aggressively tackling your student loans. High-interest credit card debt can lead to higher overall interest charges. Paying off your credit cards first could save you money in the long run. Additionally, paying down your credit card debt can help boost your credit score. Pay attention to your other types of debt and how these accounts might impact your ability to meet other financial goals. In some cases, it might make more sense to put money toward paying down other types of high-interest debt while making the minimum monthly payment on your student loans. Once your other debt is paid off, you can decide whether to start with federal or private student loans. Depending on your income, you might have access to income-driven repayment (IDR) options with your federal loans, limiting your minimum monthly payment to a percentage of your income. Private loans don\u2019t typically offer IDR options, so you might see if you can secure a lower payment on your federal loans while you tackle your private loans. Another consideration is term length. Longer term lengths, which are typically part of IDR plans as well as direct consolidation loans, generally lead to lower monthly payments. However, the longer your term, the more interest you might accrue. You could pay more in the long run if you choose a longer repayment term and don\u2019t pay off your debt early. An IDR plan may qualify for forgiveness, but a standard consolidation plan may not. Be sure to check before switching to a different repayment plan. Also, consolidation may not be right for everyone; it\u2019ll depend on your situation. As you create a student loan repayment plan, different strategies can provide you with the means to get rid of your debt faster. Choose a strategy that works best for your circumstances and that you\u2019re more likely to stick with. Here are three strategies to consider: One approach is to start with paying down your private student loans. Private loans are not eligible for forgiveness through the government. If you have private and federal loans, your federal loans may be eligible for federal student loan forgiveness depending on your occupation and other factors. For example, if you work for a qualifying nonprofit, it might make more sense to get on an IDR plan and apply for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) after making 120 qualifying payments. While you make consistent payments on your federal loans, you could work on more aggressively paying down your private student loans. Just remember: Some consolidation plans do not qualify for PSLF. IDR plans will keep your payments qualified and counted toward the 120 required payments for PSLF. Be sure to ask about PSLF before consolidating your federal loans. Some IDR plans offer automatic cancellation after 20 or 25 years. If you\u2019re on the plan for long enough, even if you don\u2019t qualify for PSLF, your remaining balance might be forgiven. Another effective strategy is the debt avalanche. With this approach, you pay off your loans from the highest interest rate to the lowest. You make the minimum payments on each balance, with the exception of the highest-rate loan. Make an extra monthly payment based on how much you can put toward the debt. For example, if you have $200 extra to put toward debt reduction and your highest-interest balance has a minimum payment of $500, you put $700 toward that debt. Once that high-interest debt is paid off, you put the entire amount of the former payment toward the next debt on your list. Starting with high-interest loans minimizes the interest you pay in the long run, since the higher rates accumulate interest charges faster. Instead of starting with high-interest loans, you can follow a similar strategy but order your loans from smallest balance to the largest. This method allows you to get a quick \u201cwin\u201d by paying off the smallest loan and offering you the satisfaction of reaching a milestone. You might pay a little more interest in the long run, but for some borrowers, the regular wins early on make it easier to stay motivated to keep paying down debt. If you\u2019re concerned with how much you\u2019ll be paying in interest in the long run and want to be debt-free faster, it can be a good idea to pay off your student loans early. However, if paying your student loan off quickly means delaying investing in your retirement, you may want to rethink your strategy. Since time is the major multiplying factor in compound interest, it is advisable to start investing as soon as possible. If that means paying off lower-interest loans like student loans more slowly, you may be better served by creating a plan that allows you to do both. To determine the right path, look at the interest rate on your student loans and the projected returns on your investments. If your student loan interest rate is lower, you may be better served by taking any extra money you might use to pay down loans and investing it instead. Talk to a financial advisor to find the best options for your situation. If you have two debts with the same interest rate, starting with the smaller balance can help you meet a milestone quicker and be a motivator to keep going. On the other hand, if you start with a higher balance, you might save a little bit more on interest. As long as you don\u2019t submit any false information, there\u2019s no harm in applying for student loan forgiveness. If you qualify, you could potentially get rid of your balance (or at least a portion of it) much faster. This might allow you to work toward other financial goals you have once you\u2019re debt-free. It\u2019s a good idea to start paying back unsubsidized student loans first, since you\u2019re more likely to have a higher balance that accrues interest much faster. Once your grace period is over, even subsidized loans will start accruing interest. However, because those balances are typically lower, the interest shouldn\u2019t add up as quickly. In general, it\u2019s better to put extra payments toward the loan\u2019s principal. When making more than the minimum payment, you might need to specify that you want the additional amount to go toward the principal to reduce the amount you owe. In the end, the best method is the one that helps you work toward your other financial goals as you pay down your student loans as quickly as possible. As you decide which student loan to pay off first, keep in mind the types of loans you have, their interest rates, and whether they might be eligible for forgiveness. Also consider consolidating and/or refinancing your loans to streamline the repayment process and provide you with a faster way to get rid of your student loan debt.

            "title": "How to Recover from Student Loan Default",
            "content": "If you\u2019ve defaulted on your student loans, you have several options to help you recover from it. Here\u2019s what student loan default means for you right now and how to get out of it. Defaulting on your student loans can be detrimental, but you can come back from it. There are a few ways that you can recover from student loan default: Fresh Start is a federal program that\u2019s designed to get your loans back on track. You can contact the U.S. Department of Education by going to myeddebt.ed.gov and logging in. You\u2019ll see an option for Fresh Start, and this is the easiest route for enrolling in the program. You can also call them at 1-800-621-3115. It\u2019s a good idea to have your latest income information on hand, which comes from your most recent tax filing, but it\u2019s not required. On the call, you\u2019ll discuss your interest in the Fresh Start program and getting out of student loan default. You\u2019ll then get enrolled in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan so your payments match up to what you can reasonably afford to pay. Once enrolled, your loans will get moved to a Department of Education loan servicer (if they\u2019re in default, your loans may currently be with a debt collector or a similar agency). Your loan status changes from \u201cdefault\u201d to \u201cin repayment,\u201d and the \u201cdefault\u201d status will also be removed from your credit report. Fresh Start gives you access to all federal financial aid, including borrowing student loans in the future. You\u2019ll also gain access to federal deferment, forbearance, and forgiveness plans. Not all loans are eligible for Fresh Start, so be sure to check if you\u2019re eligible before trying to enroll in the program. Current eligible loans include: Federal student loan rehabilitation is when you make a series of on-time payments for a set period of time. Your monthly payment is based on your income, and rehabilitation is complete when you make nine monthly payments over the course of 10 months. Specifically, you must agree in writing to make nine voluntary, reasonable and affordable monthly payments, as determined by the servicer, within 20 days of the due date and make all nine payments within 10 consecutive months. You can only rehabilitate your defaulted loans once. If you went through the Fresh Start program and defaulted on your loans again, you can still enroll in rehabilitation. Log in to your account, then select \u201cView Details\u201d under \u201cMy Aid.\u201d From there, you\u2019ll be able to see who your loan servicer is and can contact them about enrolling in rehabilitation. You can consolidate your student loans whether you\u2019re in default or not by taking out a direct consolidation loan with the Department of Education. This loan doesn\u2019t have a credit check or an income requirement. Consolidating your loans is when you combine all of your federal student loans into one loan. Your new interest rate is the weighted average of your current interest rates, rounded up to the nearest one-eighth percent. For consolidated defaulted loans, you\u2019ll need to agree to repay your new direct consolidation loan under an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan or make three consecutive full monthly payments on the defaulted loan before you consolidate. Not all loans are eligible for consolidation, so make sure you know which ones qualify before applying for a direct consolidation loan. Keep in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all approach\u2014if one doesn\u2019t work for you, explore other options before settling on the one that\u2019s best for your situation. Private student loans don\u2019t have the same protections, benefits, or programs as federal student loans. If you\u2019re looking to get out of default from a private student loan lender, you may have more work to do. Like federal student loans, you can see who your loan servicer is by checking AnnualCreditReport.com. Even if your loan servicer has sold your loan to a collection agency, they should be able to direct you to the debt collector. Contact your lender to review your repayment options. Some lenders might offer default rehabilitation programs, but those terms can vary by lender. You can also explore credit counseling to help you build out a payment plan based on your income. You can check the U.S. Department of Justice for a list of approved credit counseling agencies to avoid getting scammed by fraudsters. You can check your student loan status by logging into StudentAid.gov with your Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID. When you select your loan, you can see if the status is listed as default. You can also check to see your student loan status by checking your credit report. You can pull your credit reports from the three major credit bureaus\u2014Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion\u2014via AnnualCreditReport.com. There will be a section that details negative marks on your report, and if your student loans are in default, it will be in this section. Having your student loans in default can have detrimental impacts on your financial future, including: You have several options to recover from defaulting on your student loans. Federal student loans can be rehabilitated or consolidated, or you can take advantage of the Fresh Start program. Private student loans offer fewer options\u2014your lender may have a default rehabilitation program, but you\u2019ll have to contact them to be certain, and terms will vary by state. Defaulted student loans generally won\u2019t go away on their own. Late payments, meanwhile, will typically remain on your credit report for seven years. As of the third quarter of 2023, the average student loan debt is $37,645.16 per person. Student loan default can be hurtful to many borrowers who haven\u2019t been able to make payments and don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s any way to get out. But for federal student loan borrowers, you have a few different ways to recover from default. Review your options and stay diligent with payments so that you avoid default again.

            "content": "If you borrow for college with federal student loans and you fail to repay them, you should know that the federal government may reduce your annual Social Security income by an average of $2,500. We say \u201cmay\u201d because there are scenarios where you can have federal student loans discharged due to disability without impacting your federal benefits payments. Additionally, there are limits to how much the government may garnish your Social Security benefits. While defaulting on private student loans won\u2019t result in a loss of Social Security income, private student loan companies can sue you and get their money back that way. This guide goes over how defaulting on student loans can impact your retirement and steps that you can take to avoid student loan garnishment completely. When you default on federal student loans, you should know the government will find a way to get their money back and make your finances much more difficult to manage until they do. For example, you can get sued and have your wages garnished at work\u2014but that\u2019s far from the extent of it. According to the U.S. Department of Education, defaulting on student loans can also lead you to have your tax refunds and federal benefits payments (like Social Security payments) withheld and applied to your defaulted loans through a process called Treasury Offset. According to Federal Student Aid, you\u2019ll get a notice of the intent to offset at your last known address once the offset is scheduled to begin in 65 days. This garnishment will take place from there until your unpaid debts are entirely paid off or until the default status on your federal student loans has been removed. Fortunately, there is a limit on how much of your Social Security payments the federal government can seize through Treasury Offset. This limit is set at 15% of your federal benefits payments, which the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College believes could leave current and future retirees with 4% to 6% less in retirement income than they would otherwise have. According to the U.S. Department of Education, borrowers have the option of entering into a repayment agreement to stop garnishment of Social Security payments due to nonpayment of federal student loans, so long as a first payment is made within 65 days and regularly scheduled payments are made thereafter. If your federal student loans are in default but you have not yet received a 65-day notice letter for Social Security payment garnishment, you can also look into the Fresh Start program to help you get your loan payments back on track. This U.S. Department of Education program lets you get your defaulted loans back into \u201cin repayment\u201d status and removes the default record from your credit reports. You can also get access to federal student aid benefits again through this program, but you\u2019ll only continue qualifying if you make agreed-upon payments on your federal student loans. The U.S. Department of Education says you have the legal right to request a review of your account to prevent the Treasury Offset from occurring. According to Tate Law, this could be an option if your income is low and you\u2019re living near the poverty line. Tate Law suggests finding out whether your loan is with the Education Department or a guaranty agency by calling the Default Resolution Group at 1-800-621-3115. From there, you can request a hardship packet that lets you apply for an exception based on your financial status. Once you complete the hardship application and submit proof of household income and expenses along with a copy of the notice of the offset, you will typically hear back with a decision within six to eight weeks. You can collect federal benefits if you have student loans, and your payments won\u2019t be impacted at all if your student loan payments are up to date. The problem occurs when your student loans are in default and you get notification of an upcoming Treasury offset. You have to pay student loans regardless of how old you are when you have this type of debt, even if you\u2019re retired and on Social security. Some Social Security payments count as income when determining student loan payments on income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, whereas others do not. The U.S. Department of Education says taxable Social Security payments are the ones most likely to be counted as income. Student loan repayment plans that lead to forgiveness, including income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, require your loan payments to be up to date to qualify. If you default on federal student loan payments, a range of consequences can take place. For example, the entire balance of your loan becomes immediately due through a process called acceleration, and you lose eligibility for federal student aid. Your wages and federal benefits can be withheld, your credit score can be damaged, and the loan company can take you to court. Not paying your student loans won\u2019t end well, and that is especially true if you never have any plans to get back on track. You could not only suffer damage to your credit score and wages at your job being withheld but also have your future Social Security benefits garnished. The obvious answer to this issue is staying on track with student loan payments to avoid all the mayhem that ensues when you don\u2019t. Fortunately, there are loan repayment plans that can benefit borrowers with a low income. In fact, income-driven repayment (IDR) plans for federal student loans can come with a monthly payment as low as $0 for those who qualify.

            "title": "10 Steps to Help You Pay Off Student Loans Fast",
            "content": "How to fast-track your student debt repayment It\u2019s easy to put off paying for your student loans, since some student loan repayment plans have repayment periods upward of 20, 25, and 30 years. However, if you don\u2019t want to spend a few decades paying off your student loans, you can take steps right now to pay them off fast, including making payments while you're still in school, making larger and/or additional payments, and more. If you\u2019re currently a student, every little bit you can pay now will help you in the long run. If you can afford to chip away at your loans while in school, then you\u2019ll owe less when you graduate. You can even make payments during your six-month grace period for direct subsidized, unsubsidized or Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL). The more you pay before your loans capitalize, the less interest will get added to your principal balance after you leave school. Based on the size of your loan, your repayment plan will have a minimum amount that must be paid each month to pay off that debt within the repayment period. Making the minimum payment is enough to keep you on track with your repayment plan, but nothing is stopping you from paying more than the required amount each month. If you can add even just a few more dollars to your minimum monthly payment, then you could begin to shave months off of your repayment period. For many loan servicers, paying extra may go toward your next month's payment, which includes principal and interest. Applying your extra money to your principal will pay off your loan faster as it diminishes that amount that is earning interest. To focus your efforts on your principal, check with your loan servicer. There may be a spot to apply extra money to principal alone. Whether you come into a work bonus or get a nice tax refund, you can use a lump sum of extra cash to pay down your student loan debt. You can pay toward your principal to focus on lowering the overall amount you owe. There\u2019s nothing quite like \u201cset it and forget it.\u201d Some student loan lenders, including federal loans, offer autopay discounts, so you could lower how much you\u2019ll pay in interest over the life of your student loans as a benefit for staying on track with your repayment period. Student loan repayment will require you to set aside a portion of your monthly salary. When you leave school, you\u2019re automatically enrolled in the Standard Repayment Plan, which is set to help you pay off your loans in 10 years. This is the fastest repayment plan available, and you\u2019ll pay the least in interest over your repayment period. Compare this to income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which have longer repayment periods of either 20 or 25 years (depending on the plan). The monthly payments for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans are typically set as a percentage of your discretionary income, whereas the Standard Repayment Plan is based on your outstanding loan balance divided by 10 years. As a result, each of the Standard Repayment Plan\u2019s 120 payments is the same every month, whereas IDR plans can change annually based on family and income changes. Some jobs and companies offer matching student loan repayment benefits. They\u2019ll match your payments every month, up to a certain amount. Employers can offer employees up to $5,250 per year in tax-free student loan repayment benefits through 2025. Not every company offers student loan repayment matching, but you may want to ask your employer if they have any special benefits like this. It could help you pay off your loans much faster. If you\u2019re struggling to find extra funds to put toward paying down your student loans, consider turning a hobby into a source of additional income or use your extra time to get involved in the gig economy. You could deliver groceries, walk dogs, sell homemade creations online, etc. If your primary source of income is used to pay your other bills, then you can use your secondary source of income to chip away at your student loan debt. Just be mindful\u2014jobs that are considered 1099 contractor status do not have taxes taken out. You'll have to set aside money from each paycheck or face a hefty tax bill at the end of the year. If you\u2019ve made a budget that only has you making the minimum monthly payment, you will most likely take longer to pay off your debt. If you have the means, change your budget to focus on paying off your student loans faster. That might mean less money going toward other things, such as dining out, traveling, or shopping. Freeing up those funds means you can devote more money toward paying down your student loans. The student loan interest deduction lets borrowers claim up to $2,500 in student loan interest payments from last year, depending on their modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). You don\u2019t need to itemize deductions to claim this, and it\u2019s available for federal and private student loans. You then put this tax deduction toward paying down your student debt even further. There might be other deductions and credits for which you\u2019re eligible. Keep in mind that the student loan interest deduction is gradually reduced and eventually phased out for higher-income taxpayers. For the 2023 tax year, the MAGI phaseout for single, head-of-household, or qualifying widow(er) filers begins at $75,000 and ends at $90,000. If you are married and filing jointly, the MAGI phaseout begins at $155,000 and ends at $185,000. If you have private student loans or a mix of federal and private student loans, you may want to think about refinancing your student loans. Refinancing means you\u2019ll take out a new, private loan that pays off your existing loans, and then you\u2019ll make one payment to your new, refinanced loan. Make sure you can get a lower interest rate than what you\u2019re paying now and craft your repayment plan around what you can reasonably afford. There are several student loan companies for refinancing to choose from, each with different benefits and interest rates. Remember that you lose all federal benefits and protections when you refinance, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), Saving for a Valuable Education (SAVE) eligibility and deferment and forbearance options. Only take this route if you don\u2019t plan to use federal benefits. Perhaps the smartest way to pay off your student loans (as well as one of the fastest) is to pay more than your minimum payment. As you reduce the principal balance of your debt, the amount of interest that you\u2019ll owe over the life of the loan also decreases. There can be a downside to paying off your student loans early. Although student loans do charge interest, compared to consumer credit cards, that rate is fairly low. If you prioritize paying your student loan over paying down higher interest debt, you may end up paying more in the long run. Eliminating your student loans will also reduce the diversity of your credit mix. In the months immediately afterward, you may see a dip in your credit score, but it will quickly return to normal as you continue to make other debt payments on time. While it's entirely possible to negotiate a student loan settlement, this possibility won't be an option for everyone. For one, some lenders will be unwilling to accept a debt settlement. If your lender is open to negotiating, then your loans will likely have to be either severely delinquent or in default before a settlement would even be considered. Additionally, if you do manage to secure a debt settlement, this will likely hurt your credit score, and the forgiven debt will be taxed as income. Paying back your student loans might feel overwhelming, but there are a few different ways that you can pay them off sooner. Set clear goals, revise your budget, and take advantage of employer benefits and educational tax breaks. The more you focus on paying off your student loans right now, the more money you\u2019ll have for yourself once you do.

            "title": "What Happens When Your Student Loans Are Forgiven?",
            "content": "Andy Sacks / GettyImages If you qualify for student loan forgiveness or discharge in full, and have applied if necessary, you will get a notification that you no longer need to make payments. In some cases, you may even get a refund, depending on the program you applied under. If only some of your debt is canceled or discharged, you\u2019ll still be responsible for repaying the rest of what you owe. There may be consequences for your taxes, your credit score, and your overall financial health as well. Your federal student loans may be canceled or discharged under several existing specialized programs or under more widespread income-based forgiveness programs being pursued by President Biden. Here\u2019s how student loan forgiveness has evolved in the last year. The Supreme Court ruled on June 30, 2023, that the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students (HEROES) Act of 2003 did not give the Biden administration the authority to forgive student loan debt. Biden responded by providing a new plan for debt relief that reduces minimum payments for some borrowers and also reduces the number of years before loans are forgiven. At the same time, he announced that the Department of Education would pursue an alternative plan to provide student debt forgiveness. Under Biden's original plan, you would have been eligible for this one-time loan forgiveness if you have federal student loans (private student loans are not eligible) and make less than $125,000 annually for individual borrowers or less than $250,000 annually for families. If eligible, your loan servicer would have applied your debt relief directly to your account and then notified you if your debt had been paid in full or if there was any outstanding balance. In the latter scenario, the company also would have informed you of your new monthly payment. The plan would have provided up to $20,000 in debt relief if you were a Pell Grant recipient and met the income requirements, while all other eligible borrowers who met the income requirements would have received up to $10,000 in debt relief. A pause on student loan payments and interest began back in March 2020 and was extended multiple times throughout the pandemic. This pause ended on Sept. 1, 2023, when interest began accruing again, and payments resumed in October 2023. After the one-time debt relief plan was struck down, the Biden-Harris administration announced another path to potential forgiveness\u2014the Saving for a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. Under the SAVE plan, monthly payments would be reduced based on income, with some borrowers eligible for $0 monthly payments, and most borrowers eligible for up to $1,000 of yearly savings. Sign-ups for the SAVE plan opened in August of 2023, although applications were paused in July 2024. After ten years of payments, borrowers with initial balances of less than $12,000 are eligible for forgiveness. For those that have higher balances, the amount of time before forgiveness goes up proportionately, capping at 20 years for undergraduate loans and 25 for graduate loans. Past payments will count toward the total payment time. On July 18, 2024, a federal appeals court blocked the SAVE plan. The Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into an interest-free forbearance while the Department of Education evaluates the rulings. Employees of a U.S. federal, state, local, or tribal government or a not-for-profit organization may be eligible for a permanent program called Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). The PSLF program forgives any outstanding balance on an eligible borrower\u2019s direct loans after they\u2019ve made 120 qualifying monthly payments as part of a qualifying repayment plan, while also working full time for a qualifying employer. Due to the number and frequency of payments required, it can take at least 10 years before a borrower can qualify for PSLF. Borrowers who wish to apply for PSLF should complete the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) & Temporary Expanded PSLF (TEPSLF) Certification & Application. After submitting the PSLF form, a PSLF servicer will review it to ensure that it\u2019s complete and to determine whether your loans and employment qualify for the PSLF program. Only direct loans made by the federal government (currently known as the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program) are eligible for student loan forgiveness under PSLF.\u00a0If you instead borrowed through either of two now-defunct programs\u2014the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program or the Perkins Loan Program\u2014you are allowed to consolidate those debts into a\u00a0direct consolidation loan. The new consolidated loan is then eligible for PSLF. When your PSLF form is approved, you will be notified that the remaining balance of your eligible direct loans will be forgiven. Any payments made after your 120th qualifying payment will be treated as overpayments and refunded to you. The repayment plans that qualify for PSLF are the four income-driven repayment (IDR) plans: SAVE, Pay as You Earn (PAYE), Income-Based Repayment (IBR), and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR). Payments made under the 10-year standard repayment plan can also be qualifying payments for PSLF. Keep in mind that payments may be higher under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan versus an income-driven plan, depending on your income and the amount of student loan debt you have. Income-driven repayment plans are also an option for some student loan forgiveness as remaining balances are forgiven at the end of the plan's timeframe. For borrowers unable to pay off their federal student loan debt within the typical 10-year time frame, income-driven repayment plans set a new monthly payment at an amount that is intended to be more affordable based on your income and family size. Biden's SAVE plan is the newest iteration of these plans, but the program was blocked by federal courts in July 2024. As a result, the Department of Education outlined options for borrowers who were nearing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)\u2014borrowers can either \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if they reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan. The tradeoff with any of these programs is that IDR plans typically have much longer repayment periods of either 20 or 25 years (depending on the plan), but any remaining loan balance will be forgiven by the end of those periods. Some teachers with federal student loans can take advantage of the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program. A highly qualified teacher holding a bachelor\u2019s degree and full state certification as a teacher is eligible for this program. Eligible loans include subsidized/unsubsidized direct loans and/or subsidized/unsubsidized Stafford loans. Also, they must teach full-time for five consecutive and complete academic years at an institution serving low-income students. The maximum forgiveness amount available is $17,500 for secondary school mathematics and science teachers as well as highly qualified special education teachers or $5,000 for highly qualified full-time elementary or secondary education teachers. You may be able to get your loan discharged if the school you went to misled you or engaged in misconduct of certain loan discharge through a program known as \u201cborrower defense to loan repayment\u201d forgiveness. Borrower defense now applies mainly to private, for-profit schools. To apply, you\u2019ll need to submit an application on the Department of Education\u2019s website with evidence that the school broke the law, significantly misled you, or misrepresented itself. If your application is approved, you would get a discharge, meaning you no longer owe the loan. You could possibly get a refund of some or all of your student loan payments as well. It feels good to have your debt load lightened, but for a brief period of time, that assistance can work against you, as you might see your credit scores drop slightly. This occurs because student loans are a type of installment loan\u2014like an auto loan. When this loan is erased from your credit history, it reduces the diversity of your credit lines. As a result, it may decrease your credit score\u2014but again, only for a short period of time. And because credit mix only makes up 10% of your credit score, the dip shouldn\u2019t be too dramatic. However, there is good news: even if you fell behind on your payments before the pause began and your credit score took a hit. Once the loan forgiveness plan kicks in, the credit bureaus may delete any delinquent payments from your report. As a result, you could actually see a bump in your credit score. It\u2019s important to keep an eye on your credit report once you receive confirmation that you were approved for student debt relief. With certain types of student loan discharges, even if your student loan was in default, you may regain eligibility for federal student aid if you have not defaulted on other loans. Most student loan forgiveness is not taxed. Any loans that are canceled because you worked for a certain period of time in a certain profession are not taxable if forgiven. One exception is that debt forgiven through income-driven repayment forgiveness is usually considered taxable income. However, thanks to a provision of the American Rescue Plan, all student loan debt relief won\u2019t be treated as taxable income for federal income tax purposes from 2021 through 2025. However, some states will tax forgiven balances at the regular state income tax rate. And if the tax treatment is not extended after 2025, income-driven repayment forgiveness will once again become taxable at the federal level. If you received a refund from your student loan payments or have just been benefiting from the forbearance period, consider this an opportunity to get ahead of your finances. For example, you can use your refund to pay down other higher-interest debt, such as car payments or credit cards, or use it to create an emergency fund for peace of mind. If you have already been paying your student loan every month, move that payment over to a credit card, medical bill, or car payment, or designate it to go into your savings every month instead. If you have applied for forgiveness under a program like the PSLF or Teacher Loan Forgiveness program, your student loan servicer will notify you regarding your loan being forgiven totally or partially with a remaining balance, depending on the program. Things would work similarly if you have paid for the required number of years under an income-driven plan and are having the rest forgiven. A student loan being erased from your credit report may temporarily bring your score down a bit because it is part of your credit mix. On the plus side, the credit bureaus may also delete any delinquent loan payments from your credit report, which will help to raise your score. Eventually, your credit score may go up as your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio will be lower. Your student debt relief won\u2019t be taxed on the federal level through the end of 2025 and forever for occupation-based programs. However, it may be considered taxable income at the state level, depending on where you live. Student loan forgiveness plans are intended to provide relief for borrowers who are saddled with too much debt. Some are targeted at people who work in particular public service jobs for a certain length of time. After completing the required number of payments and services in a profession, if required, you will be notified if you are approved and provided further information on the forgiveness of your loan and any balance remaining, depending on the program. If you still have an outstanding balance after forgiveness, you can work out a new repayment plan that suits your needs. You won\u2019t be taxed federally on the forgiven amount for forgiveness occurring through the end of 2025 for income-driven payment plan forgiveness, and occupational-based forgiveness is always federally tax-free. While your credit score could dip slightly, it won\u2019t be too much or for too long. Supreme Court of the United States. \"Biden, President of the United States, et al. v.

            "content": "triloks / GettyImages The Biden administration's federal student loan forgiveness plan would have erased some of the student loan debt of over 40 million Americans, but the U.S. Supreme Court blocked implementation of the initiative in June 2023. Then in August 2023, the Biden-Harris administration introduced the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, which federal courts blocked in 2024. While the future of broad student debt cancelation is uncertain, there are steps you can take right now to potentially reduce your monthly payment, including applying for debt forgiveness, switching to an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, and refinancing your loans. Employees of a U.S. federal, state, local, or tribal government or not-for-profit organization can apply for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). The PSLF program forgives any outstanding balance on an eligible borrower\u2019s direct loans after 120 qualifying monthly payments as part of a qualifying repayment plan, so long as they work full-time for a qualifying employer. Only William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program loans are automatically eligible for PSLF. However, loans under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program or the former Perkins Loan Program are also eligible for PSLF if they're first consolidated into a direct consolidation loan. Borrowers found ineligible for student debt forgiveness will be notified by the Department of Education. Borrowers unable to pay off their federal student loan debt within the typical 10-year time frame can apply for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. These plans establish an affordable monthly payment based on a borrower\u2019s income and family size. IDR plans have repayment periods of 20 or 25 years, more than a standard repayment plan of 10 years. There are four types of IDR plans: Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE), Pay as You Earn (PAYE), Income-Based Repayment (IBR), and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR). These are also the repayment plans that can be used to make the 120 monthly payments required to qualify for PSLF. The Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, aimed to extend debt relief to Americans struggling with federal student loan debt. Based on a borrower's income, the program proposed to cut monthly student loan payments in half or even to zero. SAVE also raised the amount of income protected from repayment, which means no borrower who makes less than 225% of the federal poverty level would be required to make payments. For those with original loan amounts of $12,000 or less, the plan proposed to forgive the remaining balances after 120 payments. For higher loan balances, 12 additional payments would be required for each $1,000 borrowed over $12,000. Payments would be capped at 20 years for undergraduate loans and 25 years for graduate loans. On July 18, 2024, a federal appeals court blocked the SAVE plan until two court cases centered around the IDR plan can be resolved. The Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into an interest-free forbearance while the litigation is ongoing. It has also outlined options for borrowers who were nearing PSLF\u2014borrowers can either \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if they reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan. The Federal Student Aid website is no longer accepting applications for the SAVE plan, although borrowers can apply for other IDR plans. Borrowers who teach full-time for five complete and consecutive academic years in a low-income elementary school, secondary school, or educational service agency may be eligible for forgiveness on their direct or FFEL Program loans. Teachers must be considered \u201chighly qualified,\u201d hold a bachelor\u2019s degree and full state certification, and have subsidized direct loans, unsubsidized direct loans, subsidized Stafford loans, or unsubsidized Stafford loans. Eligible borrowers can receive a maximum forgiveness amount of $17,500 that applies only to secondary school mathematics and science teachers or highly qualified elementary or secondary-level special education teachers. All other highly qualified full-time elementary or secondary education teachers can receive loan forgiveness of up to $5,000. The Fresh Start program can help borrowers who find themselves in default. The program applies to direct loans, FFEL, and Perkins loans held by the Education Department. Borrowers must apply for the Fresh Start Program at myeddebt.ed.gov before Sept. 30, 2024. Borrowers should contact the loan provider, whether a private lender or the federal government. Either will likely consider modifying the loan, whether through lowering monthly payments or putting repayment on hold temporarily. If a student loan defaults, the collection process may begin. Wages, tax refunds, and certain government payment programs may be garnished to repay the debt, impacting the borrower's credit score. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program offers loan forgiveness after 120 qualifying payments, but to be eligible, borrowers must work for a government agency or a nonprofit. Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans offer forgiveness after a set number of payments. However, the payments usually last for 20 or 25 years. Several federal programs are designed to relieve the pressure of student debt. With the reinstatement of the SAVE plan, many more Americans would be eligible for debt relief and potential forgiveness. StudentAid.gov offers resources for those who need help finding the best payment plan or course of action to repay student loans.

            "content": "After the Supreme Court officially blocked Biden's student loan debt relief plan, new options have emerged Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Jetta Productions / GettyImages The Biden-Harris administration's plans to lessen the burden of student loan payments have had a bumpy road. The Supreme Court's June 30, 2023, decision blocked the Biden-Harris administration's student loan relief plan to wipe out up to $20,000 for each qualified borrower. Unfortunately for those who requested a refund for payments made during the student loan pause, no loan forgiveness means that borrowers now owe any previously refunded amount and will once again be responsible for eventually paying those funds back over the life of their loan(s). Biden's plan to forgive up to $20,000 in student loans per borrower was struck down by the Supreme Court on June 30, 2023. With its demise came the resumption of interest accrual and payments due. Interest began accruing on Sept. 1, 2023, and payments resumed on Oct. 1, 2023. Before the Supreme Court blocked Biden's plan, more than 16 million borrowers were conditionally approved for student loan forgiveness. While the plan was on hold, no debt was forgiven. Since then, borrowers have resumed repaying their loans. On June 24, 2024, two federal courts approved injunctions that block parts of the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. A Kansas federal court temporarily blocked, among other things, the reduction in payments from 10% to 5% that was due to start July 1. A Missouri federal court, meanwhile, moved to halt forgiveness of any more loans for borrowers who had made the required number of payments, but it didn't reverse the loans that had already been granted forgiveness. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona has stated the administration will defend the SAVE Plan, but until there are final judgments, student loan relief will remain in limbo.   On July 18, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay preventing any part of the SAVE plan from operating until a final rule can be made. Borrowers currently enrolled will be placed on an administrative forbearance. This forbearance won't count toward months of payment for income forgiveness. New applications are currently on hold. Several repayment plans forgive student loans after a set number of payments. Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans include: The U.S. Department of Education has been in the process of executing a one-time payment count adjustment so that payments or months that weren't credited toward IDR forgiveness or Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) may now be included. This adjustment will apply to borrowers with William D. Ford direct loans and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans, in addition to previously consolidated Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) Program loans and Perkins loans. There are several federal and state forgiveness plans based on your career choice, such as the following: More options exist\u2014such as discharge for those who attended fraudulent schools \"Borrower defense discharge\" applies to students who attended a school that they felt misled or lied to entice them to enroll and take out loans. Borrowers can apply for borrower defense repayment individually, but the Biden-Harris administration is also forgiving large swathes of loans for students of schools proven to have misled potential enrollees. Examples of such institutions include the American Career Institute, Corinthian Colleges, Court Reporting Institute, DeVry University, ITT Technical Institute, Marinello Schools of Beauty, Minnesota School of Business, and Westwood College, among others. Any payments made toward a borrower's student loans during the federal forbearance period were applied directly to the principal, which lowered the amount that started accruing interest when debt payments resumed in October 2023. After Biden announced his student debt forgiveness plan, borrowers who made payments during the pause were able to request a refund. However, the time to request a refund has come to an end. If you requested and received a refund check, you'll be responsible for paying that amount back. The good news is that if you were eligible for a refund, you should be eligible for one of the IDR plans that lead to student loan forgiveness. If you saved some of your refunded money, you can pay off a lump sum of your debt. Broad student debt forgiveness or cancellation is no longer being offered following the Supreme Court's decision, even if you received a notice that you were approved for forgiveness. Now, the best path to forgiveness is through PSLF or one of the IDR plans, such as SAVE. Due to legal actions in June 2024, forgiveness through the SAVE plan is now uncertain until final judgements are assessed. All student loan payment refunds from the pandemic pause will eventually have to be paid back over the life of the loan(s). You can pay a lump sum to try and lower your principal and the amount accruing interest, or you can make payments through the standard repayment plan or an IDR plan, the latter of which will eventually lead to loan forgiveness. Interest began accruing on student loans on Sept. 1, 2023, with payments resuming in October. Keep in mind this only applies to loans impacted by the pandemic-era forbearance. Some older federal loans and all private loans continued charging interest throughout the pandemic. While the SAVE plan is being evaluated, all borrowers are being placed in an administrative forbearance. This means that payments are paused due to an administrative or technical issue. Since an administrative forbearance isn't initiated by a borrower, interest rates are set to zero to prevent interest from accruing. Administrative forbearance differs from general forbearance, the latter of which must be applied for in times of economic distress. General forbearance allows borrowers to pause payments, but loans still accrue interest. Although the SAVE plan has been placed on hold, other income-driven plans are still available, including the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) plan, Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, and the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan. Blanket student loan cancellation is off the table, but there still are paths toward debt forgiveness available. If you received a refund for student loan payments made during the pause, you must repay it as part of your original loan amount. If your budget is already strained, an income-based repayment plan may help make payments more reasonable and put loan forgiveness within your reach.

            "title": "How Not to Get Burned Paying Back Your Student Loans",
            "content": "Take steps now so you don\u2019t pay your lender more later Once you are finally ready to make payments on your student loans, it might seem like a pretty straightforward thing to do\u2014just start paying, right? But depending on when you pay and even when you don\u2019t pay, you can get burned and end up owing your lender way more money than you assumed you would. So how do you make sure that you end up paying exactly what you\u2019re supposed to? Here are five tips to help you get started. It is never too early to start paying back your student loans, even if you haven\u2019t yet graduated. Most lenders give borrowers a six- to nine-month grace period from when you graduate or leave school until when you need to start paying your loans back. The grace period is there to help you to find the right repayment plan that fits your needs and land a job so you are more financially stable. However, just remember that during any grace period, interest is still accumulating on your loan and the amount that you owe is climbing. So forget waiting for the grace period to be over; instead, start paying your loan back as soon as possible. If you\u2019re working a part-time job, consider taking even 10% of your paycheck to pay down your debt. Chipping away at it when you can will definitely help in the long run. On June 30, 2023, the Supreme Court struck down the Biden-Harris Administration's attempt at one-time student loan forgiveness. With its defeat came the end of the pause on payments and interest accrual sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic. Interest began accruing on federal loans on Sept. 1, 2023, and payments resumed Oct. 1, 2023. No matter when you choose to start paying your loan, do not miss your monthly due date. If you do, you will be charged a late fee, which ends up taking more money out of your pocket. On top of that, any payments more than 90 days late will be reported to the relevant credit bureau. That might not directly affect the amount of your student loan payments, but multiple late payments can lower your credit score and, as a result, affect your future loans and interest rates. The higher the interest rate on any loans you take, the more you\u2019ll pay. As part of the 12-month 'on ramp' for student loan repayment after the payment pause, the Department of Education said that missed payments will not be considered delinquent, reported to credit bureaus, placed in default, or referred to debt collection agencies from Oct. 1, 2023, to Sept. 30, 2024. After marrying, many couples combine their incomes into one joint bank account to pay the bills. Thus, it makes sense that they may want to combine both of their student loans into one payment as well. While that will mean just one bill and a single payment, you may wish to consider otherwise. Nobody wants to think about this during wedded bliss, but if you were to get divorced or your spouse were to pass away, you could be left with the financial responsibility of the entire bill and only one income. In addition, consolidating your student loans might cost you certain tax benefits or loan forgiveness. If you are interested in a consolidation loan, make sure to read the fine print before signing on the dotted line, so you know exactly what you are responsible for if tragedy strikes. When it is time to pay, you will have a variety of payment options to choose from. For example, a standard repayment plan consists of equal payments over 10 years, while income-driven repayment plans are pay-as-you-earn. Keep in mind that the payment plan with the lowest monthly payment might be what you can afford right now, but it will take you longer to pay off the loan, and you will pay much more in interest. Closely review each option and see what best suits your financial needs and keeps the most money in your pocket, not your lender\u2019s. Sometimes, not getting burned starts way before you even get your student loan. Borrowing too much money or not searching for the best interest rates can you cost you thousands in additional interest that you\u2019ll pay back to the lender. Do your due diligence and shop around. Choose several lenders and compare the interest rates they offer with what the government offers for their student loans. Yes, but it may not be the best choice. In order to consolidate federal and private loans, the resulting single loan will be a private loan. You cannot roll a private loan into a federal loan. While a single payment may be convenient, moving to a private loan will eliminate any eligibility you may have for loan forgiveness, forbearance or deferment. Typically, federal loans have a lower interest rate than private loans. Additionally, some federal loans are subsidized, allowing a grace period after leaving school or graduating when no payments are required. Many private loans expect borrowers to start paying immediately. No. Only federal student loans are eligible for any federal student debt relief programs, whether that's reduced payments or debt forgiveness. Don\u2019t throw money out the window. Make sure you read any promissory notes before signing so you understand how to pay back your student loans, what fees you may accrue if your payment is late, and other details that can cost you money. The idea is to pay off your loan efficiently and effectively while keeping as much money in your pocket as you can. The last thing you want is to be surprised by fees or penalties because you didn\u2019t read the contract or follow the instructions.

            "title": "Should You Refinance Your Student Loans?",
            "content": "Learn the pros and cons of refinancing student debt Making monthly payments on student loans is a daunting task if you're struggling financially. If you're looking for a way to reduce your monthly payment and improve your cash flow, refinancing your student loan is one strategy. However, before you decide to refinance, it's important to consider your situation and determine whether it makes sense. Other options might be a better choice to help you better manage your student loan debt and your overall budget. The federal freeze on student loan payments, a COVID-related benefit, ended on Oct. 1, 2023. A new program, called SAVE, helps those struggling to repay their federal student loans by adjusting monthly payments based on income. The application is online. Student loan refinancing means taking out a new loan to pay off an existing loan or loans. Shifting your debt to a new loan can change the interest rate, terms, and other loan features. You can combine multiple loans into a single loan. You can refinance both federal and private student loans. You can choose to refinance all your loans or just some of them. Refinancing means you are taking out a new, private loan. Depending on your situation and the lender, you might be able to get a sufficient loan to pay off both federal and private student loans and combine them all into one. Refinancing multiple loans into one loan can make the debt easier to manage. The new loan might come with a lower interest rate that reduces your overall costs or a longer term that lowers your monthly payments. Refinancing any loan generally requires a good credit score. If you don't meet the credit and income criteria to refinance your student loans, you might need a co-signer. If you refinance your federal student loans, you're replacing them with a private loan. You lose access to federal benefits and programs that are designed to help borrowers who are struggling to pay off their student loans. Possible lower interest rate Probable lower monthly payment Easier to manage a single loan Can save money over the life of the loan Need good credit to qualify May need a co-signer Lose any federal loan benefits As you review your situation, there are some things to consider as you decide whether it makes sense to refinance your student loans. Often, this can depend on the type of loan you've taken out. If you're having trouble paying federal student loans, you might explore alternatives to private loan refinancing that are available through the U.S. Department of Education. These include: If you're eligible for either of these programs, the benefits could far outweigh refinancing your federal student loan with a private lender. However, the programs are only available for federal student loans, not loans obtained through private lenders. If you'd still prefer one payment, you might look into a direct consolidation loan through the Department of Education. This type of loan combines all your federal loans into one payment to make it more manageable. You can also choose a loan term of up to 30 years to lower your monthly payments. If you make too much money to qualify for income-driven repayment, it might make sense to refinance your federal student debt if you can get a lower interest rate. If you obtained your student loans through a private lender, refinancing or consolidating the loans may be worthwhile. If your current loans have a variable interest rate, you can consider locking in a fixed interest rate when you refinance. You'll save money over the long term and avoid sudden increases in your monthly bill. This strategy works, of course, only in periods during which interest rates are relatively low. Interest rates in general have risen throughout 2022 and 2023. If you have both private and federal student loans, you can refinance the private debt and consolidate the federal student loans separately. This still simplifies the situation but you retain eligibility for federal programs and benefits for managing the federal loans. Some government, tribal government, and nonprofit employees with federal student loans qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The Biden Administration enacted protections for federal student loan borrowers in 2020. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was signed into law in March 2020, paused student loan payments. The three-year forbearance on student loan payments and interest that began back in 2020 ended on October 1, 2023. Student loans began accruing interest again on September 1, 2023, and the monthly bills started flowing in October. If you have a federal student loan you should get a bill at least 21 days in advance of the due date. Depending on your financial situation and your credit score, refinancing could lower your interest rate, extend the repayment schedule, or both. This can lower your monthly payments and may reduce the total you pay over the life of the loan. You can refinance your federal student loan, but you might have better options for reducing your monthly payments. First determine if you're eligible for relief through the SAVE plan. The application takes about 10 minutes. If your income is too high to qualify for SAVE relief, refinancing is an option if you can get a better interest rate or other benefits by doing so. But remember you're taking your debt out of the government's hands and putting it in a bank's hands. You'll no longer be eligible for SAVE or any other student loan debt relief program. There are a few options to lower the monthly payment on federal student loans: Your individual financial situation will determine if it is better to consolidate or refinance your student loans. Refinancing your student loans can reduce your monthly payments and help you manage your budget. Your strategy for refinancing depends on whether your loans are federal, private, or a mix of both. If you want to qualify for federal programs and benefits, consider consolidating your federal loans separately and only refinancing your private student debt.

            "title": "How Much Free College Aid Are Students Missing Out On?",
            "content": "$3.58 billion in Pell Grants were left unclaimed by 2022 high school graduates Interest rates on student loans have increased dramatically in the past few academic years, and finding ways to minimize debt and save on college may be more important now than ever before. Unfortunately, too many students fail to access all the free college aid they're eligible for and the losses are staggering. In fact, a January 2023 report from the National College Attainment Network (NCAN) showed that billions of dollars in Pell Grants were left unclaimed by the high school class of 2022. What makes this particularly surprising is the fact that filling out one form is all it takes to determine eligibility for Pell Grants, which are a type of student aid that typically does not need to be repaid. Scholarships and other financial aid are also left on the table each academic year. If you're heading to college or wondering how you'll pay for higher education for a dependent, read on to learn which types of aid go unclaimed and what you can do to access them. According to a January 2023 report from the National College Attainment Network (NCAN), $3.58 billion in Pell Grants went unclaimed by students who graduated high school in 2022. This type of financial aid is awarded only to undergraduate students who \"display exceptional financial need and have not earned a bachelor's, graduate, or professional degree,\" per Federal Student Aid. Pell Grants are an especially important type of financial aid since this funding usually isn't required to be repaid, except in special circumstances. The NCAN report also revealed that more than 1.65 million high school graduates failed to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for the 2021 to 2022 academic year. Further, just under half of those graduates were likely eligible for Pell Grants and the average amount of aid left on the table worked out to $4,686 per student nationally. The National Scholarship Providers Association (NSPA) estimates that an average of $100 million in scholarship funds are left unclaimed every academic year. This is mainly due to \"a lack of applicants,\" they note, adding that scholarship providers consider a lot more than grades when choosing recipients for their awards. College-bound students can get their share of funding by dedicating some of their time to finding college scholarships and taking steps to apply. Some of the best places to find college scholarships include school counselors, college financial aid offices, civic groups, and ethnic organizations you may belong to. An array of online scholarship search engines can also help match you with scholarships you could be eligible for. While there are many reasons families fail to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year, a report from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) shed some light on this issue. Based on survey findings shared in the report, common reasons for not filling out the FAFSA include believing you can afford college without it, a belief one won't be eligible for aid, not wanting to take on student debt, and not knowing how to fill out the FAFSA. Filling out the FAFSA is the only way to find out what types of federal student aid you may be eligible for. Further, families who don't fill out the FAFSA miss out on access to federal student loans, federal grants, work-study programs, and need-based aid from states and individual colleges. A 2023 report from NCAN showed that more than $3.58 billion in Pell Grant funding was left on the table by the high school class of 2022 when they applied for college. According to the National Scholarship Providers Association (NSPA), another $100 million in scholarships go unclaimed each academic year. Future and current college students are easily leaving billions of dollars on the table when they head off to school each year. However, the bulk of this issue can be solved by having all families fill out the FAFSA form each year, even if they don't think they qualify for financial assistance. College students should also do their best to apply for college scholarships they may be eligible for, even if each application takes some time and some work. By putting some effort into paying less and borrowing less for higher education, the next generation of college graduates could be better off.

            "title": "What You Need to Know About Student Loan Servicers",
            "content": "When you get a federal student loan, you're assigned a servicer. This student loan servicer manages various aspects of your federal student loans, including repayment and what plan you end up on. Unfortunately, working with student loan servicers doesn't always result in the best outcome for student loan borrowers. Let's take a look at what you need to know about working with your loan servicer's customer service department. Through its Direct Loan Program, the U.S. Department of Education provides student loans to borrowers who want to use the money to pay for their higher education. Rather than managing the terms of your student loan repayment, however, the government assigns a company to handle various aspects of billing and repayment. The companies that manage your federal loan repayment are known as servicers. After your first loan amount is disbursed to your school, the government assigns you a servicer. You can find out who your student loan servicer is by visiting your Federal Student Aid (FSA) dashboard. You should have created an FSA ID when you applied for your student loans through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). You can use your FSA dashboard to get information about your student loans and your servicer. There are many student loan servicers. It often happens that you will start your loan under one loan servicer and move to a second or third new servicer as time goes by. This is especially true if you had Navient as your servicer because they no longer handle federal student loans. Your federal student loan servicer is supposed to help you manage your student loans after you get through school\u2014including the payment plans you're eligible for. If you can't afford your monthly payments, your student loan servicer is supposed to help you figure out which income-driven repayment plan is right for you. Additionally, your servicer is supposed to help you keep track of your student loan payments and interest. This information can be used later to help you obtain Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) or provide you with interest payment information that can be used to claim a deduction on your taxes. Student loan interest payments are reported both to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and to you on IRS Form 1098-E, Student Loan Interest Statement. Recently, some federal loan servicers have ended their contracts with the government. If this is the case for your servicer, you will be assigned a new servicer and notified of how to set up an account with them. Pay attention to both your mail and email to find out how to contact your new servicer. You can also check the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) to find out who your servicer is and how to get in touch with them. Unfortunately, there has been some controversy regarding how federal loan servicers have handled borrowers. For example, a National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) review found that student loan servicers haven't always implemented income-driven repayment appropriately. The NCLC found that only 32 borrowers had their loans canceled\u2014even though at least 4.4 million had been repaying for at least 20 years. Additionally, an exclusive investigation by NPR found that, historically, some servicers have put borrowers into the wrong repayment plans or had favored putting borrowers into forbearance instead of an income-driven plan that would have benefited them more. Finally, a report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that approximately 3,400 of the 5,300 student loan complaints lodged between Sept. 1, 2020, and Aug. 31, 2021, were against federal loan servicers. In March 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a supervisory report on unlawful junk fees uncovered in deposit accounts and in multiple loan servicing markets, including in the student loan servicing market. According to the report, customer representatives of some student loan servicers, which had policies against allowing borrowers to pay via credit card, would erroneously accept credit card payments. The servicers would then cancel these payments without offering borrowers the chance to pay again. The servicers would instead claim no payment had been made, which they used to justify charging borrowers late fees and additional interest. While you're supposed to contact your federal loan servicer for help with student loans, it's important to be prepared before you begin. First, review the income-driven repayment plan information provided by the U.S. Department of Education. Determine which plan you are eligible for and make sure you understand the terms. That way, when you speak with a customer service representative for your loan servicer, you know what to ask for. If you have older student loans under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, your loans might not be owned by the Department of Education. You might not have access to the same programs and benefits associated with the Direct Loan Program. You can check the NSLDS for information about your servicer and see what programs you might be eligible for. You may also have the option to consolidate your loans into a direct loan, which would allow you to qualify for new income-based debt relief. Next, if you plan to apply for PSLF, make sure to fill out an employment certification form each year. That way, you have a record of the qualifying payments you've made and it will be easier to obtain forgiveness. Finally, regularly review your information on the NSLDS to make sure everything matches both your records and your account information with your servicer. If you feel like the information is inaccurate or improperly applied, contact your servicer. You can also contact the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group for help resolving issues with your servicer. You can check your Federal Student Aid (FSA) dashboard or log into the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) for information on your servicer and how to contact them. No. The federal government assigns you a servicer. However, if you consolidate your loans later, you can change student loan servicers. If you're having trouble with your student loan servicer, you can file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) or contact the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group. Federal loan servicers handle your student loan repayment plan, including billing you and collecting interest. However, in the past, they haven't always provided satisfactory customer service. As a result, you need to diligently monitor your own records and consider filing a complaint if you don't think your servicer is providing you with the help you're entitled to.
