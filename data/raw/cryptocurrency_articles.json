            "content": "What you need to know about cryptocurrency investing Thana Prasongsin / Getty Images Are you considering investing in cryptocurrency? Although Bitcoin is likely the best-known virtual money, thousands of cryptocurrencies already exist. Cryptocurrency investing can take many forms, ranging from buying cryptocurrency directly to investing in crypto funds and companies. For direct investing in crypto coins, you can buy cryptocurrency using crypto exchanges or apps or through certain broker-dealers. Find out more about how you can invest in one of the newest and most inventive asset classes available. When you think of investing in cryptocurrency, you might think about buying and holding one or more crypto coins. Buying cryptocurrency directly is probably the most common way to add crypto exposure to your portfolio, but when it comes to investing in cryptocurrency, you have a few different options:  Some crypto-focused funds invest in cryptocurrency directly, while others invest in crypto-focused companies or derivative securities such as futures contracts. If you want to invest in cryptocurrency directly, then you can use a cryptocurrency exchange. Here's how to buy cryptocurrency through an exchange: As an investor in cryptocurrency, you need to decide how much of your portfolio to allocate to digital assets. A best practice among investors is to periodically review your entire portfolio to assess the need to rebalance your holdings. That might mean increasing or scaling back your crypto exposure, depending on your investment goals and other financial needs. Investing in cryptocurrency is risky. The prices of cryptocurrencies, even the most established ones, are much more volatile than the prices of other assets like stocks. The prices of cryptocurrencies in the future could also be affected by regulatory changes, with the worst-case possibility that cryptocurrency becomes illegal and therefore worthless. Many investors are nonetheless attracted to the potential upside of investing in crypto. If you decide to invest, it's important to carefully research any digital coin before buying it. Pay attention to transaction fees when making crypto purchases because these fees can vary widely among currencies. The cryptocurrency space is evolving rapidly, so it's also important to pay attention to new developments that may affect your crypto holdings. Cryptocurrency investors need to understand the tax consequences of using crypto, especially if they purchase something or sell their crypto investments. Given the riskiness of cryptocurrency as an asset class, it's especially important not to invest more money in crypto than you can afford to lose. Investing in cryptocurrency is not for everyone. The prices of cryptocurrencies can be volatile, which makes this type of investing a poor choice for conservative investors. If you are willing to assume greater risk as an investor, then investing in one or more cryptocurrencies may be right for you. You can invest in Bitcoin directly by using one of the major cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase or Binance. Another way to gain investment exposure to Bitcoin is to buy shares in a company with significant Bitcoin exposure, such as a Bitcoin mining company. A third option is to invest in a Bitcoin-focused fund such as an exchange-traded fund (ETF). There are thousands of cryptocurrencies to choose from. Some experience wild price swings between trading days and volatile drops or increases, and others make small incremental changes. Your strategy, goals, risk tolerance, and preferences will dictate which is best for your portfolio, if any. The are several ways to invest in cryptocurrency. If you're interested and can accept the risks involved, you have many choices. However, it cannot be stressed enough how volatile crypto prices are because other cryptocurrency investors are afraid of missing out on the next big price movements. These movements cause large, unpredictable price swings that can take out your investments in a matter of minutes or hours. Conversely, you may be able to double or triple your investment\u2014but there are no guarantees. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. After comprehensively reviewing 28 cryptocurrency exchanges in more than 20 weighted categories, our top picks for the best cryptocurrency exchanges include Kraken, Coinbase, and Crypto.com. To find you the best options, we researched key criteria such as security, offerings, availability, fees, financial options, features, and mobile capabilities. Cryptocurrency exchanges operate similarly to other central exchanges, such as traditional online brokerages. With the price of Bitcoin touching new all-time highs of over $90,000 in November 2024, the best crypto exchanges offer you all the tools needed to research and invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Shiba Inu or Dogecoin. In addition to providing a platform to securely buy and sell digital currencies and tokens, many crypto exchanges offer additional crypto investment services, such as staking, lending, and digital asset custody. Investing in cryptocurrencies, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and other Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are highly risky and speculative, and the markets can be extremely volatile. Consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions. This article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies; nor can the accuracy or timeliness of the information be guaranteed. Kraken Kraken\u2019s professional-grade trading platform is our pick for the best low-fee exchange because it charges some of the lowest fees in the crypto asset exchange landscape. However, it\u2019s also our top choice for experienced traders, as it offers advanced order types and supports margin and futures trading. Large number of supported cryptocurrencies Low fees Highly liquid exchange Not available in all U.S. states Limited account funding options Established in 2011 and headquartered in San Francisco, Kraken is one of the most reputable cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. The San Francisco-based exchange enables investors to buy, sell, and store over 200 cryptocurrencies while charging low fees on its professional-grade trading platform, Kraken Pro. This feature-rich crypto exchange established itself as the go-to platform for professional investors in the early days of the crypto asset market, and it has maintained its reputation as a reliable and professional trading venue. Kraken offers two platforms: its main trading platform and its professional platform, Kraken Pro. The exchange\u2019s Pro dashboard provides highly customizable chart analysis tools, detailed insight into the order books, numerous order types, and high-speed execution. In addition to spot trading, Kraken users can also trade cryptocurrency using margin and execute crypto derivatives trading strategies. Cryptocurrency investors who use the instant buy feature will incur a charge for the service. The fee will vary depending on the funding method, market conditions, order size, and asset type. When ready to execute the trade, investors will find the fee included in the pricing. Kraken and Kraken Pro both offer a tiered fee structure that allows high-volume traders to save on trading fees. For traders with 30-day volumes of less than $10,000, Kraken Pro\u2019s maker fees start at 0.25%, and taker fees start at 0.40%. However, maker fees can drop as low as 0%, and taker fees can drop as low as 0.10% (for traders with 30-day rolling volumes of over $10 million). Moreover, Kraken has limited funding options, with wire transfers being the primary payment method for Kraken users. ACH transfers are not supported. Coinbase Coinbase is our pick for the best crypto exchange for beginners because it offers a large number of supported cryptocurrencies, strong security, and advanced trading options, all on an easy-to-use platform. Large number of cryptocurrencies and trading pairs Offers both beginner-friendly and advanced trading platforms Highly liquid exchange Lack of high-quality customer service Coinbase's\u00a0default wallet is a custodial account, with no control over your private keys Coinbase\u00a0was founded in 2012 to enable people to buy, sell, and store\u00a0Bitcoin. Fast-forward to today, Coinbase is a publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange geographically decentralized with no headquarters and available in 100+ countries. It stands out for providing a user-friendly trading experience, robust security, and a range of advanced features for experienced traders. Because of its large number of supported assets (5,500+) on Coinbase Wallet and easy-to-use platform, Coinbase has become the go-to exchange for many first-time crypto buyers. The platform has the look and feel of an online banking app, which most people use already, making the transition to crypto investing simple. Coinbase also insures the digital funds it holds on behalf of users and stores U.S. dollar balances in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured bank accounts to prevent a loss of user funds in the case of a security breach. Trading accounts can be funded with a wide range of payment methods, including wire transfer and ACH transfer. What\u2019s more, Coinbase also offers crypto storage options. The first is a custodial option for new investors: storing your coins on the Coinbase.com exchange. The second is a non-custodial wallet (Coinbase Wallet) for experienced crypto users. When storing your crypto on Coinbase.com, Coinbase holds the private keys and effectively stores funds on behalf of Coinbase.com users. With Coinbase Wallet, the user has complete control over their funds as they hold the wallet\u2019s private keys. While Coinbase is a suitable digital asset exchange for both new and advanced crypto investors, trading fees can be relatively high, ranging from 0% to 0.60%, depending on trade volume. In addition, Coinbase\u2019s user feedback is relatively poor. For instance, several Trustpilot users mention problems with customer support. Additionally, there are numerous stories of unexpected account closures that have tainted the exchange\u2019s image. Moreover, Coinbase has been charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with allegedly operating as an unregistered securities exchange. The SEC claims that \u201cCoinbase, despite being subject to the securities laws, commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions.\u201d Coinbase says it has asked the SEC several times how to satisfy the regulator\u2019s concerns. Despite the exchange\u2019s drawbacks and the current charges by the SEC, Coinbase is still worth considering due to its ease of use. Crypto.com We chose Crypto.com as the best mobile crypto exchange app because it provides an extensive digital asset trading and investing ecosystem you can access easily from your smartphone. Supports more than 350 cryptocurrencies Provides a range of cryptocurrency products Poor customer support After launching in 2016 and being founded in Hong Kong, Crypto.com has established itself as one of the leading global crypto exchanges. It\u2019s now available in 90 countries worldwide, and it supports over 350 cryptocurrencies. In addition to offering a large number of supported assets, Crypto.com provides a vast digital asset ecosystem composed of its own blockchain, Crypto.org Chain; a native token called CRO; a crypto visa card; yield-generating crypto products; and more. What stands out the most, however, is the Crypto.com mobile app. While many crypto exchange mobile apps provide a watered-down version of the exchange\u2019s web-based platform, Crypto.com put a strong focus on building an app that offers a wide range of products and features so users can benefit from this exchange\u2019s ecosystem on the go. Mobile app users can buy, sell, trade, and earn interest on their crypto, as well as pay with crypto. While Crypto.com offers an impressive array of products and features, customer support is lacking. Additionally, unless you trade at higher volumes, you will end up paying trading fees of up to 0.075%. If you are looking for an excellent mobile crypto trading experience, Crypto.com is arguably the best option thanks to its range of products and features, as well as its large number of supported assets. Gemini We have picked Gemini as the crypto exchange with the best security because it has robust security protocols, insures user funds, and is SOC 2-certified. (SOC, or Service and Organization Controls, is a cybersecurity compliance standard). However, alongside its high-security standards, crypto traders will appreciate that the site's user experience is sleek and easy to use. Available to users in all 50 U.S. states Highly liquid exchange Insures funds held in hot wallet Strong security framework High fees on many trades Supports fewer cryptocurrencies than many competitor exchanges Launched in 2014 in New York City by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini stands out for putting a strong emphasis on security and compliance. The New York-based exchange has hot wallet insurance to make sure user funds remain safe in the case of a security breach. Gemini also encourages users to utilize two-factor authentication to secure their accounts, and it provides the option of reviewing and approving devices used to log into the trading account. Another standout security feature of Gemini is that it is SOC 2-certified, which means that third-party auditors have verified the company\u2019s security and compliance frameworks. Built with advanced traders in mind, Gemini provides a professional-grade trading dashboard and supports over 80 digital currencies and tokens, including fiat currencies. Gemini also offers a cryptocurrency reward card and allows participants to use it to pay for goods and services with crypto. Gemini's main platform and active trader platform use different fee structures. The primary platform charges fixed amounts for smaller trades and a very high 1.49% on trades above $200. The active trader platform charges maker and taker fees up to 0.4%, with reductions as your volume grows. These are also on the high side. However, paying the comparatively high fee may be a small price to pay for Gemini\u2019s highly robust security. Traders and investors who prefer to trade on a highly secure platform will appreciate what Gemini has to offer. BitMart BitMart is our top pick in the best for the altcoins category. Although crypto traders can still trade popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, BitMart allows users in 160+ countries to buy and sell over 1,500 cryptocurrencies. Supports a very large number of cryptocurrencies Provides crypto earning opportunities Offers a simple buy/sell cryptocurrency feature Experienced a large-scale hack in 2021 Poor feedback from customers Founded in 2017, BitMart is a global cryptocurrency exchange that\u2019s available in over 160 countries. It allows users to buy, sell, and store over 1,500 digital currencies and tokens. Incorporated in the Cayman Islands, BitMart has established itself as a leading trading venue for small and mid-cap cryptocurrencies. BitMart offers more assets and trading pairs than its market-leading peers, so Investors looking to add newly launched or obscure crypto assets to their portfolios will likely find what they are looking for on this exchange. Additionally, BitMart customers can use the exchange\u2019s Earn feature to receive interest on crypto assets held with the exchange. However, BitMart Savings is not available to investors residing in the United States. Moreover, experienced crypto traders can trade perpetual swaps on over 100 cryptocurrencies on BitMart with leverage of up to 100 times. Users can also access trading fee discounts when holding the exchange\u2019s native token, BMX. While BitMart has a lot to offer for experienced crypto traders, the exchange has received some poor customer feedback over the years. Several complaints from users reported withdrawal problems, poor customer support, and trust issues. Other users report positive experiences. Moreover, BitMart suffered a security breach in December 2021 that resulted in the loss of $196 million in user funds. BitMart promised to reimburse users. Still, the Kaspersky cybersecurity firm cites the hack as one of the most infamous cybersecurity hacks. Despite these drawbacks, crypto enthusiasts interested in trading a wide range of lesser-known cryptocurrencies will find what they are looking for on BitMart. Square Cash We chose Cash App as our top pick among Bitcoin-only exchanges as it allows you to seamlessly and securely buy, sell, and store Bitcoin from your smartphone. Easy-to-use interface Withdraw to wallets Supports the Bitcoin Lightning Network Only supports Bitcoin Custodial wallet Various limits on deposits, sales, etc. Launched in 2013 by Block, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.), and headquartered in San Francisco, Cash App allows individuals in the United States and the United Kingdom to send, spend, bank, and invest. It\u2019s essentially a mobile banking app geared towards peer-to-peer payments, but it also has an investment component. Users can invest in stocks, ETFs, and Bitcoin through Cash App. Unlike its peers, such as Robinhood and Venmo, Cash App also lets users withdraw their Bitcoin to third-party wallets, which makes it stand out from its competition. In early 2022, Cash App\u2019s CEO Jack Dorsey announced that the company has started to roll out support for the Bitcoin Lightning Network to enable near-instant Bitcoin transfers at almost no cost. The main drawback of using Cash App to buy and store Bitcoin is that the in-app wallet is custodial, which means the company holds your virtual currency on your behalf. While custodial wallets can be convenient, they are also regarded as less secure than non-custodial wallets. However, since you can withdraw your Bitcoin from Cash App, you can move your cryptocurrency into a personal wallet to which you hold the private keys. Cash App\u2019s Bitcoin trading fees vary and are only shown when you are asked to confirm your buy or sell crypto transaction. When you trade Bitcoin, Cash App uses the mid-price and adds a spread fee. Cash App is also a winner in our Best Money Transfer Apps roundup article. Making it a versatile option for those who want to own Bitcoin and be able to send money. Bisq Bisq is our pick for the best decentralized exchange because it allows users anywhere in the world to securely and privately buy and sell Bitcoin and a range of other cryptocurrencies. Available globally Offers a high degree of privacy, no ID verification required 50+ different payment options Transaction speed can be slow Trading volumes can be low Not designed for active trading Launched in 2014 and headquartered in Barcelona, Catalonia. Bisq is an open-source cryptocurrency trading software that enables individuals from across the globe to trade a range of digital currencies and tokens in a peer-to-peer manner. It currently does not disclose how many cryptocurrencies it supports. This decentralized exchange does not require users to complete a Know Your Customer (KYC) identity verification process, nor is the trading software limited to users in specific jurisdictions. On Bisq, users can buy and sell Bitcoin and other types of crypto using various payment methods, including bank wire transfers, ACH transfers, and cash deposits. While Bisq is popular among early cryptocurrency adopters as it stays true to many of the values that Bitcoin was built on, such as decentralization, privacy, and sovereignty, the exchange is not very beginner-friendly. The escrow mechanism used in the peer-to-peer trading process may be challenging for new users while the comparatively slow trade execution could deter first-time users and active traders. Additionally, the exchange is more targeted at making smaller trades as trading volumes are lower than on centralized global exchanges. However, for experienced crypto investors who prefer to trade on a decentralized, KYC-free platform, Bisq offers everything you need to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Unlike traditional brokerage firms, cryptocurrency exchanges are not members of the Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC). Therefore, unless user terms specify otherwise, investors with cryptocurrency assets commingled on a custodial cryptocurrency exchange could potentially lose their funds as unsecured creditors. Choosing the right crypto exchange that meets your needs as an investor is an essential aspect of investing in cryptocurrencies. Whether you require easy liquidity, low trading fees, a wide variety of tradable assets, or a user-friendly mobile trading experience, you can find an exchange that fits the bill. If you're looking to trade on a highly secure, regulated crypto exchange that offers a large number of supported cryptocurrencies, Gemini is your go-to choice. If, instead, you're looking to trade a wide range of new and small-cap crypto tokens, BitMart is arguably the best choice. Conversely, if you're only interested in investing in Bitcoin, CashApp is probably the most convenient option. Experienced traders looking to deploy advancing crypto derivatives trading strategies will find a home with Kraken, while privacy-conscious crypto investors will enjoy the added layer of privacy that the decentralized exchange Bisq offers. \"Crypto is a relatively new asset class that is picking up interest as the days go by. We have seen \u201cnew\u201d assets garner a great deal of interest and simply go away as time goes on. I do not believe crypto will be an asset that goes away, but how it is used and what coin or option will be the most viable is hard to tell. I think the best way to go about investing in this space is using an ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) that will provide you with exposure and diversification within the asset class. It will also insulate you from fraudsters and thieves who may try to steal Bitcoin directly from your wallet. You may think that this is impossible, but we had a family we work with that had $150k of Bitcoin stolen right from their wallet, and there was nothing they could do about it.\" - Lawrence Spung, a member of Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council. If you are looking to purchase cryptocurrencies, signing up for a crypto exchange can be your best option to get started. While buying a few hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin from a local Bitcoin ATM may be convenient, it makes more sense to use an exchange if you are looking to invest a larger amount or you\u2019re interested in buying a range of cryptocurrencies. Crypto exchanges are the safest and most legal way to obtain cryptocurrency. But those aren't the only reasons using an exchange is most suitable: When choosing a crypto exchange that meets your needs, there are several factors to consider. The most important things to look at are: Opening an account on a cryptocurrency exchange works similarly to signing up for an online brokerage account. Investors will need to provide personal and financial information to open an account successfully. Below are the general steps that investors can expect to follow: User verification can take anywhere from a few minutes to several days, depending on the exchange and the verification level required. Exchanges often offer tiered verification levels, with lower tiers requiring less information. Lower verification tiers, however, usually come with lower deposit and withdrawal limits. Investopedia collected and analyzed key data points from several crypto exchanges to identify the most important factors for readers choosing the best crypto exchange company. We used this data to review each company for fees, available cryptocurrency, minimum deposit, and other features to provide an unbiased, comprehensive review to ensure our readers make the right decision for their financial needs. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best crypto exchange since 2020. A cryptocurrency exchange is an online marketplace where users buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency. Crypto exchanges work similarly to online brokerages, as users can deposit fiat currency (such as U.S. dollars) and use those funds to purchase cryptocurrency. Users can also trade their cryptocurrency for other cryptocurrencies, and some exchanges allow users to earn interest on assets held within the exchange account. When choosing a cryptocurrency exchange, there are several things to consider, including security, fees, and cryptocurrencies offered. It is also important to understand how your cryptocurrency is stored and whether you can take custody of that cryptocurrency by transferring it to your own digital wallet. Consider whether you prefer a centralized exchange, which will closely align with financial regulations from governmental authorities (such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), or a decentralized exchange. Decentralized exchanges are unregulated online exchanges with no centralized governing authority; they offer transparent transactions and fees as well as direct peer-to-peer exchange of cryptocurrency. Most centralized exchanges allow you to deposit funds via your bank account, credit card, or debit card to purchase cryptocurrency. You can then exchange those funds for the cryptocurrency of your choosing. While some offer only simple market orders, other exchanges will allow you to set more advanced order types, including limit and stop orders. Once you purchase crypto through an exchange, the exchange typically holds it in a custodial wallet. Most exchanges store assets in offline \u201ccold storage\u201d for safekeeping. If you want to take custody of the cryptocurrency yourself, most exchanges allow you to transfer it to your \u201chot\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d wallet, along with the private keys for that cryptocurrency. When buying and selling crypto, standard safety features like two-factor authentication should be the baseline. More robust measures, like identity verification, SOC-2 certification, and user insurance, add further protection against theft and fraud. We like Gemini as an exchange with enhanced safety and security measures. All cryptocurrency exchanges charge some type of transaction fee that investors will need to pay to trade with their exchange. These fees differ depending on many factors, such as the exchange, the cryptocurrency being traded, and the tiered level of the investors themselves. The most common fees crypto investors should expect are: Investors interested in cryptocurrency, regardless of their experience level, will want an exchange that isn\u2019t overly complicated. With the fall of FTX, the SEC lawsuit against Binance, and other ongoing regulatory issues within the cryptocurrency industry, the last thing investors need is a crypto exchange that is difficult and confusing to operate. Coinbase is our choice for the best cryptocurrency exchange for beginners. The site offers an appealing user experience and is easy to navigate on the desktop and mobile app, which investors will appreciate. It offers a large number of supported cryptocurrencies, strong security, and advanced trading capabilities, all on an easy-to-use platform. The exchange is also more than adequate for sophisticated investors who require advanced features, such as a robust number of supported crypto assets and the option to utilize a non-custodial wallet. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees and regulates cryptocurrency exchanges. Since the collapse of FTX in 2022, the SEC has taken a hard stance against Cryptocurrency exchanges to prevent fraud and other security violations. Many cryptocurrency exchanges have already faced numerous regulatory issues surrounding the industry. For instance,\u00a0Binance, one of the largest exchanges in the\u00a0crypto\u00a0sector, is actively facing a lawsuit filed by the SEC for violating many security laws within the United States. Regulatory investigations by the SEC can cause many issues for investors with their respective cryptocurrency exchanges, such as account freezes and the inability to trade with the company. It\u2019s important to note that investors should conduct their due diligence in choosing a\u00a0crypto\u00a0exchange to ensure they are compliant with government regulations. Staking is an arrangement in which participants in a blockchain earn more cryptocurrency by lending a specified amount of cryptocurrency to that blockchain network for a preset period of time, for a predetermined reward\u2013like interest on a bank account. The lenders also must then validate data and transactions for the blockchain. Lenders whose validations turn out to be fraudulent or even just wrong forfeit some (or all) of their stake. We researched and reviewed several crypto exchanges to find the best platforms you see listed above. While we write individual reviews for most companies, we do not always write reviews for companies we would not recommend. Below are the companies we researched, along with links to individual company reviews to help you learn more before making a decision:\u00a0Bitrue, Coinbase, CEX.IO, Bittrex, CoinZoom, Huobi Global, bitFlyer, BitMEX, itBit, Bitfinex, eToro Crypto, Uphold, Deribit, OKX, Bitstamp, KuCoin, Poloniex, Binance, Coinmama Our team reviewed 28 cryptocurrency exchanges and collected over 1000 data points before selecting our top choices.

            "title": "Bitcoin Halving: What It Is and Why It Matters for Crypto Investors",
            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. NoNo Flores / Investopedia The Bitcoin halving refers to an event that takes place about every four years and reduces the block reward by 50%. This lowers the supply of bitcoins entering the market, which increases scarcity and can act to raise its price if market conditions remain the same. Block rewards are part of the blockchain\u2019s automatic process of validating transactions and opening new blocks (called mining). Miners, participants who compete in a race to solve a cryptographic puzzle, are given new bitcoins if they are the first to solve it. Their block is added to the blockchain, they receive a reward, and the network starts another race. All miners confirm the data in the newly added block while trying to solve the puzzle for their own new blocks, hoping for an ever-decreasing reward. There are several reasons why Bitcoin halvings are considered by many to be good for bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem and market value. For others, it might not be such a good thing. One of the key concepts behind halving the reward is to address inflation concerns. Inflation is a decrease in the amount of goods that a certain amount of currency can buy at any given moment. In the United States, inflation is measured by how much it costs to buy a basket of goods. There is an acceptable inflation rate that is considered good for an economy\u2014usually 2%\u2014but this number is generally a target set by central banks as a goal rather than a reachable figure. The Bitcoin halving is intended to counter any inflationary effects on Bitcoin by lowering the reward amount and maintaining scarcity. However, this inflation \u201cprotection\u201d mechanism does not protect Bitcoin users from the inflationary effects of the fiat currency to which it must be converted to be used in an economy. Gains made regarding market value might offer inflation protection for investors, but they don\u2019t for the cryptocurrency\u2019s intended use as a payment method. Because a halving reduces the number of new Bitcoins introduced, demand for new Bitcoins generally increases. This can be noted by looking at Bitcoin\u2019s price after each previous halving event\u2014it has typically risen. The historic increase in demand has driven price increases, which is a good thing for investors and speculators. Bitcoin wasn\u2019t intended to be an investment. It was introduced as a payment method that attempted to remove the need to have regulatory agencies or third parties involved in transactions. It became popular with investors once it was noted that there was the potential for gains. Investors poured into the new asset space, creating demand that the cryptocurrency\u2019s designers may not have anticipated. For investors, a halving represents a reduction in the new coin supply, but it also offers the promise of an increase in investment value if the event\u2019s effects remain the same. But this places Bitcoin investing into the realm of speculation because those invested in the cryptocurrency are hoping for gains. Miners are the people, groups, or businesses that focus on mining for its profitability. Even as Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuated over the years, it remained a lucrative endeavor\u2014if it hadn\u2019t, the large mining businesses wouldn\u2019t have continued operating. However, a halving cuts mining rewards, so the endeavor becomes less profitable with each halving if prices remain the same or drop. The large-scale mining facilities needed to remain competitive require enormous amounts of money and energy. The equipment and facilities need maintenance and people to conduct it. They also need to upgrade their mining capacity to maintain their position in the industry. For instance, Marathon Digital Holdings, one of the world\u2019s largest mining firms, increased its Bitcoin holdings to 16,930 and its fleet of Bitcoin miners to 231,000 in February 2024. This brought the firm\u2019s hash rate to 28.7 trillion hashes per second (about 5% of the network\u2019s total hash rate as of May 2024). The increase in production capacity and holdings was likely due to anticipations of the April 2024 halving and the amount of hashing power required to remain competitive while having the liquidity necessary to finance its operations. For smaller miners, a decrease in the reward means lower chances. Miners who are part of a mining pool will likely experience smaller rewards, even if prices increase\u2014the reward is being cut in half, but Bitcoin\u2019s price is not likely to double unless there is a drastic market event. Consumers and retail Bitcoin users might be affected by a halving in the value of the Bitcoin they hold. Those who buy Bitcoin to make purchases will generally only be affected by price fluctuations, which may or may not remain similar to those before the halving occurred. For those using Bitcoin for remittances, a halving means the same thing as it does for shoppers. The value of their remittances will depend on Bitcoin\u2019s market price after the halving event. The next halving is expected to occur in 2028, when the block reward will fall to 1.625 BTC. The first Bitcoin block reward was 50 bitcoin. There have been four halvings since 2009. These halving dates were: As of May 2024, about 19.7 million bitcoins were in circulation, leaving just around 1.3 million to be released via mining rewards. Many investors have high expectations for halvings because, in the past, prices generally trended upward after the event. However, the trends historically moved slowly, over months and years until the next halving, and there is no guarantee that Bitcoin will follow the same trajectory. So, whether you invest in Bitcoin before, at, or after a halving depends on market conditions at the time, your outlook, and your risk tolerance level. For instance, the latest halving was unique among halvings in that Spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) only a few months before the event. Investors and speculators flocked to these new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or moved capital from the once-popular Bitcoin ETF Trusts to them. One month after the halving, the market shifted again, and prices dropped. The ETFs experienced significant outflows at the beginning of May, followed by a similar level of inflows\u2014in mid-May, the market became more optimistic about Ether ETF while bitcoin\u2019s price soared. It seems that, at least for the foreseeable future, the only thing anyone can do is make a wild guess as to what the market will do. The term \u201chalving\u201d as it relates to Bitcoin concerns how many tokens are rewarded\u2014the amount is cut in half. This acts to simulate diminishing returns while increasing scarcity, which is intended to raise demand. Halvings have occurred or will occur on the following dates: The Bitcoin blockchain conducted its 2024 halving on April 19, 2024. If Bitcoin maintains its schedule of one halving every four years, there are 29 halvings left (as of 2024). Bitcoins can be divided into smaller denominations called satoshis, which are equivalent to 0.00000001 bitcoin. Block rewards will drop to this amount in 2136, and the last satoshi is expected to be awarded right before the last halving in mid-2140. A Bitcoin halving cuts the rate at which new Bitcoins are released into circulation in half. The rewards system is expected to continue until 2140, when the proposed limit of 21 million bitcoins is theoretically reached. In 2009, the reward for each block in the chain mined was 50 bitcoins. After the first halving, it was 25, 12.5, and then 6.25 bitcoins on May 11, 2020. The reward was reduced to 3.125 when the latest halving occurred on April 19, 2024. Bitcoin halving has significant implications for its network. For miners, the halving event may result in consolidation in their ranks as individual miners and small outfits drop out of the mining ecosystem or are taken over by larger players.

            "title": "How to Find New Cryptocurrencies for Investment",
            "content": "Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. DragonImages / Getty Images It can be a challenge to find a cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin or Ethereum that might be worth the investment. If you're somewhat new to cryptocurrency, it's quite different than traditional investing. You'll need to know where to go for information and updates and how to analyze them to determine if they have potential. Here are some ways you can identify new cryptocurrencies for investment. Before you start to look, you may want to ask yourself a few key questions, notably: Navigating the cryptocurrency landscape can be confusing. The absence of quantifiable and trustworthy criteria for evaluation and a plethora of scams have further perplexed potential investors and made them wary. But despite the problems, cryptocurrencies may be an asset class worth investigating. They can add diversity to your portfolio, and their price volatility can offer good returns.\u00a0There are several places you can monitor to see what new cryptocurrencies are emerging: Cryptocurrency exchanges are one of the most reliable sources for finding new investments. For example, Coinbase generally lists new cryptocurrencies on its website, but you must set up an account for better access. Binance also lists new crypto you can review and investigate further. A data aggregator gathers information on specific topics. Cryptocurrency data aggregators help you find new crypto. For instance, CoinMarketCap collects and displays a list of new cryptocurrencies, their prices, market capacity, and trading volume. This type of service helps you get some information to determine what other investors think about the cryptocurrency and whether it has potential. CoinGecko is another data aggregator that lists new coins with much of the same information that CoinMarketCap offers. Crypto data aggregators may report late or inaccurate information from exchanges because there can be network lag between trades made and prices displayed on the aggregator. The best way to see real-time prices is to use a trading platform. Social media is known for its ability to transmit information fast. X (formerly Twitter), for example, is one of the quickest-moving and -responding platforms in the United States. You can easily find cryptocurrency developers and founders on X, tweeting about their cryptocurrency whenever there are changes or new coins. Notifications for specific keywords on X are especially helpful. If you set up alerts for phrases like new crypto, crypto release, or crypto, you will receive notifications about any cryptocurrency-related tweet. Telegram is another instant messaging platform that can deliver timely new crypto developments. There are many websites that you can look over to find new cryptocurrencies. Some of the more reputable ones are Top ICO List, Trading View, and CoinMarketCap. You can use several tools to help you verify the validity of a cryptocurrency. KryptView lets you enter the token name or address, and BSCCheck lets you check tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. Each displays information about transactions, contracts, holders, prices, and more, enabling you to see whether anyone else is active. There are many other tools available for investigating tokens. Token Sniffer lets you enter the cryptocurrency's name or address and displays an audit of it. For instance, a scan of Ax-1 Orbit (address 0x0c...b805) displayed the following information for the token dated Aug. 8, 2022: Token Sniffer Token Sniffer lets you view the contract code and generate a bubble map showing you the creator\u2019s address, the addresses of the top 100 holders, and the percentage they hold. You\u2019ll also see any burn addresses, which is where developers send coins to take them permanently out of circulation. Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are ecosystems that combine blockchain, programming, and user interfaces that allow you to create decentralized applications (dApps). Some might even offer exchange and trading services, but most are designed to support decentralized finance applications like peer-to-peer lending, borrowing, and providing liquidity. Many DeFi platforms have native tokens used within their networks to facilitate transactions. Examples of DeFi platforms are Maker, Uniswap, and Aave. In addition to being a blockchain, Ethereum also functions as a DeFi platform because it allows users to create anything they want on it, including dApps. NFTs are assets that have been tokenized. Tokenization is the process of linking hashed information from the asset and storing it on a blockchain. It establishes ownership without question because the token\u2019s network validators must verify ownership through a consensus. NFTs are also critical components of the metaverse, an emerging tech trend championed by enterprises that operate in the digital landscape. OpenSea and Rarible are two examples of popular NFT marketplaces. Here, you can find them ranging in price from hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars. There are also specialized marketplaces that focus on a particular industry or sport. For example, the National Basketball Association (NBA) has an NFT marketplace called TopShot, and the National Football League (NFL) has partnered with Dapper Labs to produce exclusive digital video highlights of iconic moments in its history. Luxury retailers, such as Tiffany and Gucci, sell NFTs, which are popular with some customers. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) eclipsed venture capital as the primary fundraising method for entrepreneurs in 2018. Startups and prominent companies alike jumped onto the ICO bandwagon. Then, the ICO bubble burst as scams proliferated in their ecosystem, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began investigating and cracking down on them. The SEC now provides substantial guidance on when tokens and ICOs are considered the sale of a security. You can still find ICOs, but they are highly regulated and not nearly as numerous. You can also invest indirectly in cryptocurrencies through derivatives that trade on mainstream exchanges. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) crypto futures, including Bitcoin and ether futures, are popular with investors looking for indirect exposure to crypto. Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs), based on CME\u2019s Bitcoin futures, debuted in crypto markets in 2021. In January 2024, the long-awaited and embattled Bitcoin Spot ETFs were approved by the SEC. These ETFs offer exposure to bitcoin but are much cheaper because you can purchase shares of a fund that holds bitcoin rather than buy bitcoin directly. Shortly after the Bitcoin Spot ETFs were approved, the SEC approved several Etherem Spot ETFs. There are always new projects with cryptocurrencies appearing, so there is no shortage of choices. You can invest in the most popular cryptocurrencies (as of Oct. 13, 2024, 2:40 p.m. EDT): Note that the numbers listed above change by the second, and past performance is no indication of future performance. Also, there are many, many other cryptocurrencies with the potential to grow. When evaluating that opportunity, consider several factors, such as price, market cap, 24-hour volume, social sentiment toward it, legal battles, government regulations, and reading the whitepaper. Beneath their technical jargon, cryptocurrencies are products that usually serve a purpose, whether it be only a payment method (bitcoin) or as a utility token used to perform actions on a blockchain (ether). However, meme coins (such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu) generally do not have a purpose\u2014but somehow have accumulated fans that value them. Here are some factors to look into and tools you can use to help identify a coin that is not a so-called rug pull (or another scam). A rug pull is a coin whose developers will accept payments for it and then pull it off whatever platform you purchased it on while keeping the funds you paid. Ethereum's ether (ETH) token is used as a payment system on its blockchain. This makes ETH a perfect example of a use case that might incentivize someone to buy ETH. Ethereum is designed for scalability and future development, making it an ideal ecosystem on which to build DeFi applications. The uses for Ethereum, the global virtual machine that powers much of DeFi\u2014and is rumored to be the choice of developers for Web 3\u2014continue to grow. New utility tokens designed to work on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) emerge frequently. Bitcoin, on the other hand, was designed purely as a payment method. But when investors noticed its price was climbing, the token developed another purpose. The global pandemic briefly shut down much of the world's economy, and stock markets worldwide tumbled. Bitcoin became a safe haven for investors looking to preserve value and a speculative investment. The more use cases that a new coin and the blockchain that it supports have, the more likely it is that the cryptocurrency will last long enough to experience growth. However, this won't always be the case. A cryptocurrency needs liquidity\u2014meaning that it should have enough trading volume to sell it quickly if you need to. If you find a cryptocurrency with no volume, you should consider waiting to see whether it will develop any. If other investors aren\u2019t trading a new crypto coin in large amounts, it might indicate that it isn\u2019t yet worth buying or is a scam. You should identify the value a coin has or might have. It\u2019s likely that if it has value to you, others will value it. This type of value isn\u2019t only monetary; it could be intangible, such as an NFT that you identify with on a personal level. Some songwriters and musicians are creating NFTs from their music. Purchasing a song NFT directly supports the artists and gives you ownership of the token and whatever rights the artist granted when the token was minted. The sports tokens mentioned previously may be the equivalent of trading cards or videos of the future. Some additional considerations are: New cryptocurrencies are introduced daily, so there is no shortage. Some new coins listed on Binance on Oct. 13, 2024, were Magnet6900 (MAGNET6900), Smiling Dolphin (MIHARU), PAL (PAL), STI690 (STI), and Nasdaq420 NASDAQ (420). It's difficult to predict which crypto will perform in the future because they are so volatile and sentiment drives prices more than fundamentals. Which is best depends on who you ask and their market outlook, risk tolerance, and knowledge of the space. So, the best upcoming crypto is the one that meets all of your personal investment criteria. The universe of investable cryptocurrencies and crypto-related products and services is still small and requires careful evaluation. If you\u2019re interested in investing in digital assets and new crypto, you should first talk with a finance professional to help you figure out if the investments make sense for your goals and financial circumstances.

            "title": "Cryptocurrency Regulations Around the World",
            "content": "Corporate Compliance Insights\u200b The growth of\u00a0cryptocurrency\u00a0from speculative investment to a new asset class has prompted governments around the world to explore ways to regulate it. As of September 2024, some governments have created frameworks to provide protection for users, while others bide their time. The U.S. announced a new framework in 2022 that opened the door to further regulation. The new directive handed power to existing market regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The SEC is already regulating the sector, demonstrated by its lengthy list of filings against crypto-centric businesses and projects, such as lawsuits and complaints against Ripple, Coinbase (COIN), Binance (BNB), and many others over their crypto products and services. But in 2023, a district court of appeals decided that Ripple's sale of XRP were securities offerings only when sold to institutions, not when they were sold on exchanges. This was one partial victory for the crypto industry\u2014it was followed by another decision in November that vacated the Commission's denial of Grayscal's application to convert its Bitcoin ETF Trust to an ETF that holds bitcoin. The court ordered the Commission to re-review the application, which eventually led to the approval of the first Bitcoin Spot ETFs in January 2024 and Ethereum Spot ETFs in July 2024. The continuous fight between regulators, broker-dealers, investors, and the crypto industry shows that the U.S. is still evolving, regardless of the frameworks introduced and the powers given to regulators. As SEC chair Gary Gensler stated, the fight will likely continue, \"It [the approvals] should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities. Nor does the approval signal anything about the Commission's views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws. As I've said in the past, and without prejudging any one crypto asset, the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws...While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin.\" Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are issued by central banks and backed by governments. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized by definition and are not CBDCs, so CBDCs are not discussed in this article. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) bans crypto enterprises from operating in the country, stating that they facilitate public financing without approval. Furthermore, China banned Bitcoin mining in May 2021, forcing many engaging in the activity to close operations entirely or relocate to jurisdictions with a more favorable regulatory environment. And in September 2021, cryptocurrencies were banned outright. While crypto is not considered legal tender in Canada, the country has been more proactive than others about crypto regulation. Canada became the first country to approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), with several trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. As for crypto trading platforms, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) require that crypto trading platforms and dealers in the country register with provincial regulators. Canada classifies all crypto investment firms as money service businesses (MSBs) and requires that they register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC). From a taxation standpoint, Canada treats cryptocurrency similarly to other commodities. In October 2022, the lower house of the British Parliament recognized crypto assets as regulated financial instruments. The Financial Services and Markets bill became an act (law) in June of 2023 and extended existing laws regarding all crypto assets, services, and providers. There are cryptocurrency-specific reporting requirements relating to Know Your Client (KYC) standards, as well as anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT). Although investors still pay capital gains tax on crypto trading profits, more broadly, taxability depends on the crypto activities undertaken and who engages in the transaction. Crypto derivatives trading is banned in the U.K. Crypto exchanges and custodian wallet providers must comply with the reporting requirements set by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI). Crypto firms must notify the OFSI as soon as possible if they know or have reasonable suspicion that a person is subject to sanctions or has committed a financial sanctions offense. Japan takes a progressive approach to crypto regulations, recognizing cryptocurrencies as legal property under the Payment Services Act (PSA). Meanwhile, crypto exchanges in the country must register with the Financial Services Agency (FSA) and comply with AML/CFT obligations. Japan established the Japanese Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) in 2020, and all crypto exchanges are members. Japan treats trading gains generated from cryptocurrency as miscellaneous income and taxes investors accordingly. The country has been working on several aspects when it comes to regulation, including taxation. In September 2022, the government announced it would introduce remittance rules as early as May 2023 to prevent criminals from using cryptocurrency exchanges to launder money. The Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds has been revised to allow for the collection of customer information. Australia classifies cryptocurrencies as legal property, subjecting them to capital gains tax. Exchanges are free to operate in the country, provided that they register with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) and meet specific AML/CTF obligations. In 2019, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) introduced regulatory requirements for initial coin offerings (ICOs). It banned exchanges from offering privacy coins, which are cryptocurrencies that preserve anonymity by obscuring the flow of money across their networks. In 2021, Australia announced plans to create a licensing framework around cryptocurrency and potentially launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC). In October 2023, the Australian treasury announced plans to introduce a regulatory framework, with a draft to be released sometime in 2024. There will be a 12-month transitionary period if the framework is approved and implemented. Like the U.K., this island state classifies cryptocurrency as property but not legal tender. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) licenses and regulates exchanges as outlined in the Payment Services Act (PSA). Singapore issued guidance in 2022 warning digital payment token (DPT) providers to avoid advertising their services to the public. In August 2023, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced a framework that would regulate stablecoin issues in the country, requiring any issuers to conform to specific criteria. Stablecoins must be approved by the MAS to be allowed to use the label \"MAS-regulated stablecoin\" to distinguish themselves from non-regulated stablecoins. Singapore, in part, gets its reputation as a cryptocurrency safe haven because long-term capital gains are not taxed. However, the country taxes companies that regularly transact in cryptocurrency, treating gains as income. In South Korea, cryptocurrency exchanges and other virtual asset service providers must register with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KFIU), a division of the Financial Services Commission (FSC). South Korea also banned all privacy coins from exchanges in 2021. In 2023, the South Korean government's Act on the Protection of Virtual Asset Users went into effect. The Act officially appointed the Financial Services Commission as a regulator for virtual assets and outlined their legal and illegal uses. Additionally, the Act ensured user protection by requiring issuers or service providers to follow certain practices. India remains on the fence regarding crypto regulation, neither legalizing nor penalizing its use. There is a bill in circulation that prohibits all private cryptocurrencies in India, but it has yet to be voted on. There is a 30% tax levied on all crypto investments and a 1% tax deduction at source (TDS) on crypto trades. Overall, India continues to hesitate to ban crypto outright or to regulate it. The country's Finance Bill of 2022 defined virtual digital assets as property and outlined tax requirements for collecting taxes on income from them. Bitcoin is not legal tender in Brazil, but the country passed a law legalizing cryptocurrencies as payment methods throughout the country, boosting the adoption of digital currencies. Brazil\u2019s Chamber of Deputies approved a regulatory framework legalizing the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment in the country on Nov. 29, 2022. The bill was enacted as a law and entered into force on June 20, 2023, as Law No. 14,478, \u201cLegal Framework for Virtual Assets\u201d. The Brazilian Central Bank was designated the competent authority to regulate, authorize, and supervise operations of crypto exchanges, pursuant to Decree No. 11,563 of June 13, 2023. Cryptocurrency is legal throughout most of the European Union (EU), although exchange governance depends on individual member states. Meanwhile, taxation also varies by country within the EU and ranges from 0% to about 48%. Recently, the EU\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directives (5AMLD and 6AMLD) have come into effect, tightening KYC/CFT obligations and standard reporting requirements. In September 2020, the European Commission proposed the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA)\u2014a framework that increases consumer protections, establishes explicit crypto industry conduct, and introduces new licensing requirements. In April 2023, Parliament approved measures that allow legislation requiring certain crypto service providers to seek an operating license. MiCA was provisionally agreed on in 2022 and placed into effect in July 2023. This legislation is intended to give regulators the tools they need to track crypto being used for money laundering and terrorism funding while providing users with protections. Cryptocurrency regulations are still being researched, developed, and implemented worldwide. Many countries are creating policies and legislation, while others lag for various reasons. Many states are crypto-friendly, such as California, Florida, and Texas. It depends on where you live and the laws that have been implemented. There are also several general rules that you could consider following. While cryptocurrency has existed since 2009, governments and regulators globally are still working out ways to govern its uses. Consumers and businesses must be protected from fraudulent activity, and preventative measures must be implemented to fight illicit crypto uses. Many countries are progressing, but it is a slow and controversial process. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

He currently researches and teaches economic sociology and the social studies of finance at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Bloomberg / Contributor / Getty Images Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a type of ETF that holds Bitcoin with the aim of tracking its current or spot price. In the fall of 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the sale of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs on American exchanges. Investors can use these derivatives to bet on or hedge against Bitcoin's price moves through regulated markets without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Like traditional stock options, spot bitcoin ETF options give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell shares of types of crypto ETFs. However, the contracts combine two complex elements: the\u00a0volatility of cryptocurrency markets and the intricacies of options trading. Below, we'll explore these characteristics and the risks of trading them. Spot Bitcoin ETF options are financial contracts that give you the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) shares of the underlying asset, which is the Spot Bitcoin ETFs at a pre-given price before a set expiration. Investors can trade these derivatives to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price moves without directly holding the cryptocurrency or even the ETF shares themselves. The SEC approved options on the following ETFs: Options on spot bitcoin ETFs are like traditional equity options but with risks and prospects tied to the bitcoin market. Unlike trading cryptocurrencies directly or using derivatives on digital exchanges, these instruments offer a standardized, regulated framework that works through existing brokerage accounts. Investors can use these instruments in several ways: Spot Bitcoin ETF options offer several advantages: Like all options for ETFs, but especially those involving cryptocurrency, there are risks: The date when Spot Bitcoin ETFs (which hold actual crypto tokens) began trading in the U.S., following SEC approval. The intersection of cryptocurrency volatility and options complexity means these instruments require significant market knowledge to trade effectively. While they offer prospects for portfolio management, they're best suited for investors who understand both the technical aspects of options trading and the fundamentals driving bitcoin markets. The SEC's approval of Spot Bitcoin ETF options brings another set of cryptocurrency investment products to U.S. markets. These instruments provide sophisticated investors with tools for risk management and additional returns within regulated markets. However, Bitcoin's volatility and the complexity of options trading mean these products are best suited for experienced traders with a clear strategy and the know-how to manage their risk.

            "content": "Learn where and how to invest in spot ether ETFs Following the success of spot bitcoin ETFs at the start of 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved nine spot ether ETFs for trading on July 23, 2024, giving everyday investors another opportunity to diversify into cryptocurrency. With the launch of these spot ETFs, investors can now take advantage of Ethereum\u2019s volatility in a convenient and regulated manner without the hassle of setting up crypto wallets and accounts. Buying spot ether ETFs is as easy as buying a stock, with these ETFs available for trading on traditional exchanges like Nasdaq, Cboe BZX, and NYSE Arca. Investors can buy these spot ETFs on many online brokerage platforms and robo-advisors that offer traditional assets. While Ethereum ETFs are already trading in the market, spot ether ETFs allow investors to directly invest in Ethereum, as opposed to future ether ETFs that hold contracts tied to ether\u2019s value. Before investing in any spot ether ETF, you have to understand how it works and the risks involved. Spot ether ETFs are available for trading on many self-directed brokerages and robo-advisors. These ETFs might soon be integrated into IRAs and 401(k)s, similar to spot bitcoin ETFs. Although they are more suited to investors with higher-risk appetites because of their inherent volatility, they are generally more stable than their underlying cryptocurrencies. However, when picking a spot ether ETF, the first thing any investor should consider is the ETF\u2019s net asset value. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with a lower net asset value could be more suitable for investors on a limited budget, but fees have to be taken into consideration. Spot ether ETFs come with various management fees such as gross expense ratio, net expense ratio, and sometimes a sponsor fee. For example, BlackRock\u2019s spot ether ETF product, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, requires investors to pay a sponsor fee of 0.25%, while Fidelity and Invesco\u2019s spot ether ETFs do not have a sponsor fee. However, Invesco charges a separate 0.25% management fee on its Galaxy Ethereum ETF. Investors have to take all these fees into account before purchasing a spot ether ETF. Spot ether ETFs allow investors to take advantage of Ethereum\u2019s growth and appeal without holding the underlying ether. Here are the benefits investors can enjoy from these ETFs: Spot ether ETFs are a good way to invest in Ethereum directly, allowing anyone to gain a good entry point into cryptocurrencies without a lot of exposure. However, there are other ways investors can benefit from ether\u2019s volatility. Spot ether ETFs allow investors to track and gain exposure to ether with minimal risk. While Bitcoin is seen as digital gold, ether ETFs could experience more demand with increasing innovation. These ETFs are tradeable on several brokerages and robo-advisors, but be wary of exorbitant management fees. Also, these ETFs do not give holders benefits like staking rewards and crypto airdrops. Demand for these ETFs may dwindle with ether\u2019s utility and regulatory battles, so investors have to be aware of these risks before buying them. Ether is a digital currency used to pay for transactions and items on the Ethereum network. The ether paid for transactions, also known as gas, goes to validators who run the network and approve transactions. Although ether and Ethereum are used interchangeably, they stand for different things. While Ethereum is a blockchain-based programming software used to create dApps, smart contracts, and NFTs, ether is the native currency of this network and is used to pay for transactions on the network. A spot ether ETF is a financial product that allows you to invest in Ethereum without directly buying it. These ETFs provide a more secure, regulated, and convenient way to benefit from Ethereum\u2019s price in real time without setting up crypto asset management platforms like hot wallets. Ethereum offers an attractive opportunity for investments as it has more use cases than Bitcoin. Previously, ether was mined on the Ethereum network by validators or miners, who solve complex computational problems to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain via the proof of work (PoW) mechanism. Since Ethereum\u2019s transition to the proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, validators can no longer mine Ethereum and can only accumulate it via staking or buying it. Buying a spot ether ETF right now is a good idea for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio and make an early investment in Ethereum. While ether\u2019s price is expected to rise over time due to increased utility, cryptocurrencies are naturally volatile, and past performance is not indicative of future returns. However, before you buy a spot ether ETF, consider your portfolio goals, factor in fees, consider counterparty risk, and prioritize ETFs with self-custody and a lower total expense ratio.

Learn where and how to invest in spot bitcoin ETFs Anchiy / Getty Images Following the SEC's recent approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, investing in bitcoin is now more accessible to average investors eager to get into the cryptocurrency space. For investors and traders, buying a spot bitcoin ETF is like buying shares in any other ETF or security. Spot bitcoin ETFs are available on a variety of traditional platforms that offer popular services, like stock and options trading, retirement planning, advisory services, and automated investing. Tradeable on traditional exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, these ETFs allow investors to enjoy the leverage of investing in bitcoin without a need to hold it or understand how crypto platforms work. Before investing, you should be aware of how these ETFs work and the risks involved. Spot bitcoin ETFs are now available to trade on several online brokerage and robo-advisor platforms. These new ETFs are also eligible for use in many retirement accounts, like Bitcoin IRAs, traditional IRAs and Roth IRA accounts, and solo 401(k) plans. When picking spot bitcoin ETFs, it is critical for investors to analyze the fees involved. For now, some issuers are offering fee waivers to encourage investments. For example, VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL) is waiving its sponsor fees thru March 31, 2025 or until it hits $1.5 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). It\u2019s important to note that these platforms offering fee waivers for bitcoin ETFs are competing for investors, and these fee waivers are temporary. High management fees, like the one charged by Grayscale (1.50%), can cut into your ETF profits. Investors should aim for funds with annual management fees between 0.2% and 0.5%. Investing in bitcoin ETFs requires a suitable account such as those listed above, most of which you can open in 30 minutes or less. Creating an account is easy and can typically be done online. The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs fulfills a need for individuals and institutions to invest in bitcoin in a regulated, convenient manner without the need to hold it. These are the benefits investors can enjoy from spot bitcoin ETFs. Investing in spot bitcoin ETFs poses some risks. Bitcoin ETFs are still subject to market manipulation common with digital assets (especially cryptocurrencies). Other risks to consider include: Spot bitcoin ETFs are a new asset class. While exciting, there are other ways of investing for anyone looking to get into bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs are subject to far more volatility than regular ETFs and could be caught in regulatory crossfires. Here are ways to invest in bitcoin directly or indirectly without buying a spot bitcoin ETF. Spot bitcoin ETFs are a new class of investments that allows investors to invest in bitcoin at their convenience with far less risk. They are available through retirement accounts, and on automated investing platforms (robo-advisors), and online brokerages during open market hours, but not on crypto exchanges. To get started with spot bitcoin ETFs, open and fund an account with a brokerage platform, continuously monitor the ETF, and be mindful of fees and commissions. Bitcoin is the first virtual, decentralized cryptocurrency traded over a peer-to-peer network. Transactions on this network are recorded on the blockchain, a distributed ledger, to promote transparency and reduce intermediaries. Bitcoin is used for payments, investing, and speculation, and was created by a pseudonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto in January 2009. The smallest unit of a bitcoin is a satoshi (100 millionths of a bitcoin). A spot bitcoin ETF invests directly in bitcoins as the underlying asset. This differs from bitcoin futures ETFs, which are based on derivatives contracts of their prices. Spot bitcoin ETFs comprise underlying bitcoins that are securely stored in a vault by the company offering the ETFs. BTC is the ticker symbol for bitcoin, and it\u2019s how the cryptocurrency is abbreviated and represented in the financial markets. Investors can search the price of bitcoin and find bitcoin-related news by using the ticker symbol BTC with their preferred platform or investment research site. Buying a spot bitcoin ETF is a good idea for anyone who wants to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without the hassle of owning and storing them. Like any investment, however, the potential for bitcoin to deliver positive returns varies depending on the time period under consideration. Bitcoin's price is volatile, influenced by market sentiment and external factors. If you believe in its long-term potential as a decentralized digital currency and store of value, now might be a suitable time to buy, considering its historical growth. However, be cautious of short-term fluctuations, as the volatility can be unsettling for risk-averse investors.

She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. As Bitcoin earned a stable place within the investment community, Bitcoin and blockchain-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also gained investor interest. The emergence of these ETFs allows access to a broader spectrum of investors wanting exposure to these digital assets without the complications of direct asset management. Blockchain ETFs\u2014a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)\u2014offer a more diversified exposure to the broader blockchain industry across sectors like finance, supply chain management, and healthcare that the technology is changing. Alternatively, Bitcoin ETFs are more focused, providing more direct exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin, the best-known cryptocurrency. These funds either hold Bitcoin directly or track its price through futures contracts, giving investors a way to benefit from Bitcoin's price appreciation without storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Despite these differences, media reports frequently treat the terms \"Bitcoin\" and \"blockchain\" interchangeably. As a result, it's possible to confuse blockchain ETFs\u00a0and\u00a0Bitcoin ETFs, although they are different financial instruments. Blockchain ETFs primarily track the stock prices of companies that have invested in blockchain technology in their fund, though they aren\u2019t too focused on a specific cryptocurrency or entity. Blockchain is a technology not tied to a particular company or product. \u201cBitcoin needs blockchain, but blockchain doesn\u2019t need Bitcoin,\u201d said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify ETFs, which says it\u2019s the largest ETF focused on blockchain. The blockchain universe of investments is not restricted to a particular sector, such as IBM's blockchain relationships with the auto sector, wineries, and healthcare. Other firms whose shares are typically held by blockchain ETFs are Visa, which is exploring ways to use blockchain to restructure payment frictions, and Honeywell, a manufacturing company that uses blockchain for supply chain management. On the technology front, Nvidia, the graphics processing units giant, provides hardware essential for cryptocurrency mining and blockchain operations and is a blockchain ETF mainstay. When investing in any ETF, pay attention to the expense ratio, which is what you will pay in fees. Expense ratios reduce returns, so the lower the better. Most Bitcoin ETFs approved by the SEC track the price of Bitcoin through futures contracts traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. In this model, ETFs follow the price of Bitcoin by owning futures contracts. In October 2021, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) launched the first Bitcoin futures ETF, tracking Bitcoin futures contracts pegged to the future price of the cryptocurrency. Since then, several other funds have launched to expose investors to the Bitcoin market without direct ownership of the currency, including the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF), and the Simplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF (MAXI). Some funds focus on different crypto-related strategies. ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF (BITI) allows investors to short Bitcoin, thus profiting from a decline rather than a rise in Bitcoin prices. Other ETFs invest in blockchain companies and Bitcoin futures, such as the Global X Blockchain and Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS), which blurs the line between these ETFs. For many years, U.S. regulators rejected proposals for funds that hold Bitcoins directly, citing worries over the potential for fraud and market manipulation. The regulator also raised these concerns about Tether and other stablecoins. However, the SEC eventually relented in 2023, after a federal appeals court ruled that the regulator had provided insufficient justification for rejecting the ETF applications by the asset manager Grayscale Investments. After the ruling, the SEC approved the first Bitcoin spot ETFs, 11 of them, which began trading in January 2024. The SEC approved the first bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024, allowing these funds to directly hold bitcoin on behalf of their clients. In May 2024, the SEC also approved a rule change that would allow ETFs to hold the ether cryptocurrency on behalf of their clients as well. Understanding the difference between Bitcoin ETFs and blockchain ETFs means knowing the difference between the instruments they track. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, while a blockchain is the underlying database technology. This distinction is significant when considered within the context of investment instruments. Even though Bitcoin futures were already offered on the U.S.\u2019s major exchanges, cryptocurrency\u2019s regulatory status remains unclear in some jurisdictions. As adoption increased, virtual currencies have been embroiled in several regulatory battles for their role in criminal activities, such as money laundering. Alternatively, blockchain technology has won the interest of major companies in the world of legacy finance, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Visa. Blockchain technology is neither banned nor under scrutiny by regulatory agencies. Blockchain ETFs are also relatively stable compared with the volatility of Bitcoin since they are not exposed to Bitcoin\u2019s price swings. That said, blockchain is still considered a nascent technology. As such, the stock prices of companies tracked by the ETF are more susceptible to factors that do not affect blockchain technology. Bitcoin ETFs are also affected by regulations on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There are 26 blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs trading in U.S.\u00a0markets, according to the ETF Database. As of May 24, 2024, these ETFs have a combined worth of just over $60 billion in assets under management (AUM), and their expense ratios range from 0.3% to 2.5%. Focus on companies that work with blockchain Invest in company stock, not cryptocurrency Blockchain technology is being explored by many companies and isn't tied to a specific business or product Tends to be more stable Spot Bitcoin ETFs directly hold Bitcoin Other Bitcoin ETFs invest in cryptocurrency futures to track Bitcoin prices Tend to be more volatile Blockchain ETFs are available through most securities brokerages, including Fidelity, E*Trade, and Robinhood. The easiest way to identify these funds is to search for \u201cblockchain\u201d in your brokerage\u2019s ETF screener. This will return a list of funds you can research further to determine if they meet your investment criteria. You can invest in a Bitcoin ETF through the same broker you use for other ETFs. Using your broker\u2019s ETF screener, search for terms like \u201cBitcoin\u201d or \u201ccrypto\u201d to identify funds related to cryptocurrencies. From there, you can narrow your search further by researching each fund's management and investment philosophy. Bitcoin futures ETFs began trading in October 2021, and the first Bitcoin spot ETFs were approved in January 2024. Bitcoin ETFs are generally reactive to events affecting the cryptocurrency market, frequently distinct from the wider technology or financial markets. The price of Bitcoin could be influenced by regulatory news, adoption by major institutions, or economic events or problems in the crypto world affecting investor sentiment toward these currencies. Blockchain ETFs tend to respond more in line with the broader technology and financial market trends since they represent investments from a cross-section of blockchain technology companies in various sectors. As the popularity of Bitcoin continues to grow, so have Bitcoin ETFs. In general, digital currencies are mainstream with institutional investors. Many details are appealing about a cryptocurrency ETF\u2014investors would be able to buy and sell Bitcoin more easily and eliminate the inconvenience of securing and storing Bitcoin.

            "content": "Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. Blockchain exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hold stocks of companies that profit from or have business operations tied to blockchain technology. Best known for its use in maintaining decentralized records of cryptocurrency transactions, blockchain technology has potential applications across many industries, with use cases as diverse as protecting healthcare data and managing video streaming services, among many others. As the number of ETFs available on the market has grown, investors can target an increasing variety of market areas and asset types. Blockchain-based ETFs\u2014a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)\u2014are one way to invest in a diversified set of companies that may have cryptocurrency on their balance sheet or engage with blockchain technology in other parts of their business. Twenty-five blockchain ETFs provide U.S. investors with access to companies utilizing the technology as of January 2024. Blockchain ETFs offer an efficient vehicle to invest in a select\u00a0basket of blockchain-specific stocks. From an investor's perspective, these funds work just like any other ETF\u2014you gain access to a group of stocks in the blockchain industry in a single instrument that trades on an exchange just like an individual stock. The majority of U.S.-traded blockchain ETFs are passively managed, tracking the performance of an underlying index. For example, the Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN) aims to track the performance of a specially designed index called the Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index. This index includes companies involved in\u00a0research, development, support, or utilization of blockchain technology and associated businesses. The index methodology assigns a \"Blockchain Score\" to each potential company stock that may be an eligible candidate for inclusion. This score is based on several factors, such as how a company contributes to the blockchain ecosystem, its blockchain product maturity and associated economic impact, investments and expenditures on research and development activities, company results, and innovations. The factor-based methodology ensures that the potential of a blockchain company and its business is gauged with higher accuracy for realistic economic profits, renovated business prospects, and operational competence. The 50 to 100 companies with the top Blockchain Scores qualify for entry into\u00a0this index, and the same stocks get replicated in the BLCN ETF. The index is rebalanced every six months. Several blockchain ETFs opt for an active management strategy rather than relying on a custom-designed index like BLCN. With total assets over $1.1 billion as of January 2024, making it among the largest U.S.-traded blockchain ETFs, the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) is one example of an actively managed fund. BLOK ETF issuer Amplify believes its active strategy allows its fund managers to \"make timely decisions and identify companies that are best positioned to profit from the developing blockchain technology space.\" The fund commits to investing at least 80% of its assets in stocks of companies deriving significant income from transformational data sharing-related business or engaged in the research and development, proof-of-concept testing, or implementation of similar technology. Whether they use active or passive strategies, blockchain ETFs often invest in companies from the banking and financial sector, technology, IT services, hardware, internet, telecom services, and even biotechnology firms that may be using some form of data sharing or blockchain-based systems. For example, BLCN holds stocks like MicroStrategy (MSTR), Coinbase (COIN), Block (SQ), and Beyond (BYON). BLOK includes MicroStrategy and Coinbase among its top holdings, along with Japan-based financial services group SBI Holdings (8473.T), Accenture (ACN), and Riot Platforms (RIOT). As blockchain technology remains open and global, these ETFs include companies from around the globe. Regionally, both BLCN and BLOK have the bulk of exposure to North American-based blockchain companies, while the rest is shared by Asian and European companies in varying proportions. Beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology is finding use in various other sectors. For one thing, the technology has extended its reach into other areas of the banking and financial markets. Financial institutions are using blockchain for international payments, equity swaps, cross-border trade, regulatory compliance, and protecting customer information. But the potential uses of blockchain technology are not limited just to the financial world. The technology has potential in integrating health care data, tracking goods along the supply chain, and helping media companies protect their intellectual property. Even government systems involving voting and identity management could benefit from the blockchain's enhanced security and transparency. Being a theme-based investment, blockchain ETFs carry the inherent risk of non-performance, non-adaptability, or failure of the blockchain ecosystem. While there is an increasing level of acceptance for blockchain systems, the concept remains dependent on the evolution of the overall ecosystem,\u00a0the reliability and stability of the blockchain network, its configuration, and its successful adoption. Another inherent risk is that blockchain ETFs may end up investing in earlier-stage technology-based companies, which are prone to failure. While the diversification through ETFs mitigates such stock-specific risk to a reasonable extent, the risk of specific holdings not performing well remains. Additionally, the holdings of blockchain ETFs often overlap with existing technology and internet companies. Companies included in the portfolio may derive a larger share of their revenues from non-blockchain-based products and services. For instance, some blockchain ETF holdings might generate most of their\u00a0revenues from networking equipment and computer processors, with a limited share of hardware used in blockchain-based systems. Blockchain segments may be contributing only a small part of overall revenues to\u00a0such stocks, making the overall returns vulnerable to the non-performance of their majority non-blockchain segments. One also needs to be aware of the expense ratio charged by funds and the trading charges levied by such ETF units. For example, BLCN and BLOK have expense ratios of 0.68% and 0.75%, respectively\u2014significantly higher than a fund like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which charges 0.09%. According to ETF database provider VettaFi, 25 blockchain-related ETFs traded in U.S. markets as of January 2024. While their strategies and holdings may vary, these funds invest in shares of companies that utilize and develop blockchain technology and solutions rather than holding or being related to cryptocurrency prices. For the most part, blockchain ETFs hold shares of companies involved in blockchain development. Generally, the funds don't hold cryptocurrency, but companies included in the ETF can if it's not against the fund's directives. Blockchains themselves have not yet been securitized. But you can buy shares of companies that use and develop the technology, invest in a blockchain exchange-traded fund (ETF) to gain exposure to a group of blockchain-related companies, or purchase shares of an ETF that holds bitcoin. Blockchain ETFs invest in a portfolio of companies with business activities related to the blockchain. This distributed database technology underpins cryptocurrency transactions and has many other applications. Some blockchain ETFs seek to track the performance of specialized indexes, while others are actively managed in an attempt to capitalize on the latest technological developments.

            "title": "What Is Regenerative Finance (ReFi)?",
            "content": "Jacob Wade has been a nationally-recognized personal finance expert for the past decade. He has written professionally for The Balance, LendingTree, CompareCards, Investing Answers, and other widely-followed sites. Investopedia / Mira Norian Regenerative finance (ReFi) is a term used to describe blockchain projects that are developed such that the resources used over time are regenerated. ReFi projects use raised capital to attempt to provide a positive financial impact on the world. This can include money earned from crypto token sales or additional funds raised within the project for specific purposes. Traditional finance has often been criticized for putting short-term profits ahead of long-term sustainability. Michael Kramer, managing partner and director of social research at Natural Investment Services, introduced the concept of \"regenerative investing\" in 2003. He referred to the new investment style as regenerative because it pulled resources into projects that mimicked operations of nature to recycle energy and matter. John Fullerton coined the term \"regenerative economics\" in his 2015 paper, \"Regenerative Capitalism.\" Fullerton stated that traditional capitalism doesn't implicitly prevent negative environmental and societal impacts but encourages exploring a new \"form of capitalism that produces lasting social and economic vitality for global civilization as a whole.\" Regenerative finance goes a step further than environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing and focuses on actually recovering and improving the environmental and societal impacts of traditional capitalism instead of just reducing the negative side effects. ReFi can be implemented in several ways. Some crypto projects are focused on reducing carbon emissions as well as helping community-led initiatives fight climate change. Organizations such as the Climate Collective help raise awareness for projects that use blockchain technology to deploy regenerative financial solutions. These projects can assist by helping companies invest in carbon credits, incentivizing regenerative land-use practices, or even creating platforms to help organize climate-saving initiatives. Regenerative finance can also help preserve cultural heritage artifacts and historical records by using blockchain to store permanent records. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can be used to create verifiable and immutable records on the blockchain for these artifacts, making them an unchangeable part of history. Traditional methods of recording history or inventorying artifacts are subject to change, but the blockchain locks these records in place. NFTs of some of these items can be minted, allowing cultural centers around the globe to raise funds for the future preservation of historical items. Regenerative finance is ultimately designed to create a more balanced, nondestructive economy that incentivizes social and environmental good. The goal of ReFi is to create an economy that thrives off mitigating climate change, reversing some of the effects of carbon emissions, and pursuing social change. As with any Web3 cryptocurrency project, regenerative finance projects can be used in scams. There are always risks when investing in alternative assets such as crypto; regenerative finance isn't immune to these. Some projects have lofty goals but vague language about how these goals will be accomplished. They try to capitalize on the movement because regenerative finance is trending. Here are a few things to watch out for: Users can log into a chosen web app, connect a digital wallet, and deposit crypto onto the platform to use regenerative finance and can choose from a list of supported crypto to borrow against the collateral deposited when the funds are deposited. Regenerative finance is generally an automated platform governed by smart contracts. Loans are handled instantaneously and the crypto will be deposited into a user\u2019s digital wallet when a loan is confirmed. There are no monthly payments required but the loan will accrue interest. Loans must be paid back using the cryptocurrency that was borrowed. Regenerative finance (ReFi) projects are blockchain projects that are developed so that the resources used over time are regenerated. An emerging idea is a digital carbon market, where the voluntary carbon market is replaced using blockchain networks. The idea is to bring more transparency, availability, and even liquidity to the carbon credit market. ReFi is based on regenerative economy principles conceived by John Fullerton. They are: empowered participation, view wealth holistically, innovative adaptive response, seek balance, edge effect abundance, honor place and community, robust circulation, and in right relationship. Regenerative finance (ReFi) is the crypto-equivalent of ESG investing but with a more direct and flexible approach to making change. Crypto-based projects can often quickly raise capital and generate a return on investment while directing funds toward immediately impactful initiatives. However, just because a crypto project labels itself \"regenerative,\" it doesn't mean it's a good investment. As with any crypto project, you should research the team, road map, and reputation before allocating any funds to it. The Worldwatch Institute. \"2008 State of the World.\" Page 185.

Learn how to safely store your crypto and keep it secure Westend61 / Getty Images As a newbie getting started with cryptocurrency investments, one of the first things you must consider is how to buy and store cryptocurrency safely. Knowing how and where to store your crypto before pressing the \u201cbuy\u201d button is essential so your crypto investment journey doesn\u2019t suffer an early setback. One thing to note is that you can't store cryptocurrencies in a regular bank account; they have to be stored in a crypto wallet on reputable crypto exchanges/apps or specialized devices. You have to choose a storage option that is both secure and accessible. Any mistakes can have consequences as significant as losing your entire crypto stash. In 2021, Stefan Thomas, a programmer and Bitcoin enthusiast lost 7,002 Bitcoins (BTC), now worth about $203 million, because he couldn't remember his wallet password. To help you avoid a similar disaster, this crypto storage guide will explore the many storage options and the factors to consider before choosing an option that meets your preferred safety, security, and accessibility needs. You need a wallet to store cryptocurrency. A crypto wallet is a device or program that keeps your crypto assets, private keys, and various wallet addresses (public keys) all in the same place. When you purchase a crypto asset, you\u2019ll need somewhere safe to keep it. Most crypto investors leave their crypto on the exchange where they bought the asset. These exchanges provide free hot wallets with little or no setup required, but you\u2019ll need an account with the exchange to gain access to these wallets. Opening a cryptocurrency account is quick if you have the necessary details. A few wallets even allow you to open multiple user accounts on the same wallet. Remember, you'll need to provide the necessary KYC details; these details help exchanges and wallets keep money laundering and other financial crimes in check. Running background checks before you sign up with an exchange/wallet is crucial. These checks save you a lot of headaches and prevent you from falling into the hands of scammers posing as legitimate business owners. The first place to look is the company's website. There are several questions to ask, including: Although many things are anonymous in the crypto space, owners of wallets/companies rarely are. If you\u2019re satisfied with the company\u2019s website authenticity, head to social media to check out its official social media handles. Also, pay attention to any red flags and listen to what other people are saying about the company. Do a lot of people say it\u2019s inefficient? To use a cryptocurrency wallet/exchange for the first time, you need to sign up with some details and documents to give the exchange some background information on you. Here is the information most exchanges require: Since cryptocurrency is money, it needs to be kept safe: away from hackers, scammers, and other bad actors. If these people get ahold of your crypto, they can send it to another wallet or sell it for money, leaving you with nothing. In choosing a crypto wallet storage option, consider one with a security system that makes it difficult for anyone to hack your wallet and steal your assets. There are different types of secure wallet options you can go with, including crypto exchanges, cold storage wallets, paper wallets, and hot crypto wallets. If you want to access your crypto more quickly, choose either a crypto exchange or hot crypto wallet. If you\u2019d like to focus more on security and storing cryptocurrency offline, cold storage or paper wallets\u00a0 are ideal options. A crypto exchange is an application that lets you access crypto and carry out crypto-related transactions. Most wallets are free to download but involve a transaction fee for sending or selling cryptocurrency. Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken are all popular examples of cryptocurrency exchanges. A cold storage wallet is a type of wallet not connected to the internet. With these types of wallets, your crypto is safe from hackers, so these are ideal for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency. Many users go for Trezor and Ledger. Unlike a cold wallet, a hot crypto wallet is connected to the internet. That means you need an internet connection to access your crypto. Although these wallets are more susceptible to hacks, they make accessing your crypto frequently for transactions easier. Numerous hot crypto wallets are available on the market today, but Guarda and Mycelium are good picks based on security. Although paper wallets are now phasing out, they\u2018re still practical for storing cryptocurrencies. A typical paper wallet contains your private keys and your address printed on it. Paper wallets are relatively safe, but if the paper gets stolen or goes missing, the thief could easily read your keys and take your crypto, or you lose your crypto forever. No cryptocurrency storage method is 100% safe, even with the various security measures. Storing your crypto on an exchange is often regarded as the easiest way to keep it, but you can also quickly lose it to hackers. If your exchange gets attacked, you could permanently lose your crypto, even though your passwords and private keys are safe. Typically, cold storage is the safest way to store your crypto away from online hacks and security breaches. But you can also lose your crypto, especially if you lose your device or it gets stolen. Furthermore, water or fire damage can permanently cause your crypto to go down the drain, especially if you did not back up your seed phrase. Hot crypto wallets pose almost the same risk as storing crypto on exchanges. However, they\u2019re relatively safer. If your device gets hacked or you accidentally install malware, your wallet could be completely drained. Your paper wallet is highly vulnerable to physical damage or wear and tear. These wallets are pretty inexpensive, but they\u2018re easy prey for attackers. The attacker only needs to get a hold of the paper to rob you. So, even if you have copies of the paper wallet, it doesn't help much since your private keys are on any copy you print out or keep in your device\u2019s storage as a soft copy. Security:\u00a0 Review an exchange\u2019s security features before setting up an account. We recommend you go with one that offers two-factor authentication or an additional security measure to the usual password feature. Fees: Many exchanges charge a small fee for sending, selling, or buying cryptocurrencies. If you would like to trade cryptocurrency often, your best bet is to go with an exchange with moderately low fees to save you the extra money spent on charges. Number and quality of supported cryptocurrencies for options trading: If your goal is to trade a variety of crypto assets, you will need to choose an exchange that offers more than just BTC and Ethereum (ETH). Storage and custody: Using a custodial storage option like a hot crypto wallet is better if you're not too good with keeping passwords and passphrases. These options keep your crypto for you and can help you recover your password if you forget it. Customer service: Although many exchanges have a customer care center or an email to reach them in case of issues, it\u2019s preferable to go for one with a live chat option. Those have faster reply times and can be convenient for wallet-related emergencies. You can store large amounts of cryptocurrencies by any storage method, but storing them in cold wallets is best. Cold wallets are the most secure option and can store any amount of cryptocurrencies for a long time. You can store cryptocurrency online as well as offline. Offline storage options include cold storage wallets and paper wallets. These days, people rarely use paper wallets. You should get a solid, secure cold wallet to keep your crypto offline. Cryptocurrency exchanges are not entirely safe. An exchange can easily be hacked, and your wallet might be part of the unfortunate ones affected. You should store crypto on exchanges mostly if you make a lot of crypto transactions or trade crypto. Yes, you can store multiple cryptocurrencies in one wallet. Many cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges automatically create separate wallets for as many cryptocurrencies as they support. In a few cases, you\u2019ll have to manually add a new wallet for the new crypto you want to store. The best wallet to store all cryptocurrency would be a cold, portable and secure one. A centralized exchange is a cryptocurrency trading platform where you buy, sell, and transfer crypto with the help of an intermediary (the exchange). These exchanges help you with crypto transactions for a fee; however, your crypto might be used by the exchange for personal uses, which is what happened with FTX. To access an account with a centralized exchange via the web, you\u2019ll need a password or PIN most times. With apps, you can open your account regularly with little or no security. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are created to eliminate the control and need for a middle entity. Instead, they run on smart contracts and do not hold your crypto for you. With DEXs, the exchange cannot access your crypto and misappropriate it. To use these types of exchanges, you must hold your crypto separately in another wallet and connect it to the decentralized exchange (DEX) when you want to transact. When you\u2019re done, immediately disconnect your wallet from the site for security reasons. Although decentralized exchanges are harder to use, they are more private and can help you transact anonymously, as they don\u2019t require KYC. A hybrid exchange combines the features of both centralized and decentralized exchanges by allowing you to carry out high-volume transactions. However, some hybrid exchanges require KYC for huge transactions. With these kinds of exchanges, you can be sure of faster transactions, as users are matched with each other on a decentralized database.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn what a crypto wallet is and how to create one Vithun Khamsong / Getty Images The cryptocurrency industry has witnessed remarkable growth over the past few years, and prospects for future growth remain strong. As crypto market participants continue to speculate on the future trend of digital assets, this is sure to present potential opportunities for traders and investors.Of course, the first step that is required to be able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies is to create a crypto wallet. This guide will explore everything you need to know about creating a crypto wallet, including why it's essential, what features you should look for, which crypto exchange to link it to, and how to choose the right wallet to suit your needs. Creating a software crypto wallet is crucial for anyone looking to trade and manage cryptocurrency assets. In this section, we will outline the necessary steps to create a software crypto wallet. Here's how it works. Step 1: Select a software wallet app. The first step in creating a software crypto wallet is to select a reliable wallet provider. There are several wallet options available in the market, each with its unique features and security protocols, making it essential to conduct thorough research before selecting a wallet. Some of the best software wallets available in the market include Exodus, Electrum, and Trust Wallet. Step 2: Download the wallet app to your phone or computer. Once you have selected a suitable software crypto wallet, download the app to your phone or computer. Having a wallet app installed on your device ensures that you can access your crypto assets whenever you need to. When downloading the app, ensure that you get it from the official app store or the wallet provider's website to avoid downloading malicious software that could compromise your security. Step 3: Create an account. Next, create an account by filling in basic information such as your name, email address, and a strong password. Some wallet apps may also require you to complete an identity verification process, which involves submitting a government-issued ID and a selfie. Step 4: Transfer your assets. Once you have created your software crypto wallet and set up your account, the next step is to transfer assets into it. There are several ways to transfer assets, including depositing funds from a bank account, exchanging cryptocurrencies, or receiving them from another wallet. Most software wallets support multiple cryptocurrencies, allowing you to transfer various assets. To fund your wallet, you will need to obtain the wallet address and use it to send the assets to it. Some wallets also support QR codes that can be scanned to facilitate the transfer. Step 1: Select the hardware you want to use. The first step is to research and compare different wallets to determine which one best fits your needs. Look for reputable manufacturers, customer reviews, and security features. Some popular hardware wallets include Ledger Nano X, Trezor Model T, and KeepKey, all of which offer different features and levels of security. Step 2: Purchase the hardware and install the required software. The next step is to purchase the hardware wallet and install the required software. The software installation process varies depending on the hardware wallet, but most wallets have a setup wizard that guides you through the installation process. The setup wizard will prompt you to download and install the wallet application on your computer or mobile device. Once the software is installed, you can connect your hardware wallet to your computer or mobile device using a USB cable or Bluetooth connection. Ensure that you follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully during the installation process to ensure that the wallet is set up correctly. Step 3: Transfer your cryptocurrency. After setting up your hardware wallet and installing the required software, transfer your cryptocurrency to the wallet. You will need to link your hardware wallet to a brokerage account or exchange in order to transfer your cryptocurrency to your wallet. Once your cryptocurrency is transferred to your hardware wallet, it will be stored offline, providing an additional layer of security to your digital assets. Creating a paper wallet is a simple and cost-effective way to store your cryptocurrency offline. This section will cover the steps required to create a paper wallet. Step 1: Go offline. To ensure maximum security, it is recommended that you go offline when creating a paper wallet. This reduces the risk of online attacks and ensures that your private key is generated offline.\u00a0You can unplug your internet cord or disable the internet connection, but you might need to remain connected to your home network to print. Step 2: Transfer the keys to a document or write them down. To create a paper wallet, you can type on a document or write your keys or seed phrases on a piece of paper. Some programs exist that will let you create these documents, but it's best to do it manually. Once you do this and double- or triple-check them, remove them from your digital wallet. Step 3: Print keys. Print or write the private keys on a piece of paper and keep it in a secure location, such as a safe or a lockbox, to ensure that it is not lost or stolen. It is crucial to secure your paper wallet key as it provides access to your cryptocurrency funds. Online paper wallet generators are convenient but are not a safe way to create paper wallets because you do not control how or if the information is stored or used, no matter what the website or reviews say. Opening a cryptocurrency wallet account is an essential step for anyone looking to invest in or use cryptocurrencies. To create a wallet account, there are a few things that you need to consider, including selecting a wallet provider, providing personal information, and having some cryptocurrency to store in your wallet. Whether you choose a software, hardware, or paper wallet, this guide will help you understand what you need to open a crypto wallet account. To open a crypto wallet account, you'll typically need to provide the following personal information to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations: You'll need to have an understanding of public and private keys to operate your crypto wallet. A public key is like your wallet's address, where other users can send you cryptocurrency. A private key is like the password to your wallet, which only you should know. If someone has access to your private key, they have access to your funds. The process of creating a crypto wallet can be overwhelming, but considering a few factors can make it easier, including: Software wallets, which can be downloaded as mobile or desktop applications, are often free to use. However, some software wallets may charge a small transaction fee when sending or receiving cryptocurrencies. Hardware wallets, on the other hand, are physical devices that require a one-time purchase, which can range from around $50 to $200, depending on the brand and features. There are several types of cryptocurrency wallets available, each with its own unique features and characteristics. There are several risks associated with storing cryptocurrency, some of which include: Choosing the right crypto wallet is crucial for the security and accessibility of your cryptocurrency holdings. Here are some factors to consider when choosing a crypto wallet:"

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn what it takes to buy SafeMoon Crypto Lucy Adegbe is a Content Writer with a major focus on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency trading. Just_Super / Getty Images SafeMoon was designed to reward long-term holders and charges sellers a 10% fee, with part of that fee going back to existing holders. First launched on the Build and Build (BNB) chain in March 2021, SafeMoon can now be bought on some exchanges such as Pancakeswap. Though some may claim SafeMoon is resistant to manipulation, others note the dramatic volatility and fall of SafeMoon's price in 2022 as potentially unusual trading behavior. Investors should conduct thorough research before making all investment decisions, including and especially those involve cryptocurrencies.  Digital currencies are virtual assets, secured by cryptographic encryptions and powered by the distributed ledger technology known as the blockchain. Virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other stablecoins now serve as media of exchange globally. Investing in cryptocurrencies can be complicated since thousands of them exist but only a handful are real. As an investor, you should research the quality and realness of a coin before leaping. Some distinct features of SafeMoon include the static reward where 50% of tokens from its transaction fees (usually 10%) are distributed to token holders, as well as the manual burn where the supply of SafeMoon tokens reduces to increase the price and demand. SafeMoon also has a self-sustaining liquidity pool that can siphon tokens in the form of fees, which are then added to the token\u2019s liquidity pool on Pancakeswap. In the past year, some celebrities have invested and endorsed SafeMoon. They include social media personality and professional boxer Jake Paul, with a YouTube channel of over 20 million subscribers, who has claimed that investing in SafeMoon can make everyone rich in the long run. Others are Brett Ratner and DJ Afrojack. Investing in cryptocurrencies, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and other Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and the markets can be extremely volatile. Consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions. This article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies nor can the accuracy or timeliness of the information be guaranteed. SafeMoon launched an updated SafeMoon token in December 2021. The updated token consolidates the original version in a ratio of 1:1000 while ensuring transactions cost lower. If you hold original SafeMoon tokens in a wallet and choose to switch them to SafeMoon V2, it can only be done manually. The switching process is quite easy. SafeMoon wallet users can update the app to the latest version and follow the instructions while those with other kinds of wallets can visit SafeMoon Swap to convert their tokens. Additionally, if you hold your SafeMoon tokens on an exchange, you don't have to switch to the V2 tokens. This is because the exchange handles the migration process and gives an update on the status of the process. Compared to the original version, SafeMoon V2 processes transactions at a much lower cost. The V2 transaction fee is now 2% of the entire transaction. An alternative way of buying SafeMoon is to use the SafeMoon Swap decentralized application that is available on the Build and Build chain. This way you trade BNB tokens for SafeMoon tokens. It is important to note several allegations against SafeMoon as part of your research on deciding whether SafeMoon is the right investment for you. In April 2022, Stephen \"Coffeezilla\" Findeisen accused the SafeMoon team of misappropriating millions of dollars. Findeisen found evidence of SafeMoon's liquidity wallet moving funds to a wallet called the \"Gabe (6abe) wallet,\" which withdrew funds to a separate company run by John Karony. Thomas \"Papa\" Smith, former SafeMoon CTO, responded to Findeisen's claims, stating that funds were taken from the \"locked liquidity pool\" before Karony's appointment. In February 2022, a class-action lawsuit against SafeMoon was filed, alleging the company is a pump and dump scheme. Jake Paul, Nick Carter, Soulja Boy, Lil Yachty, and Ben Phillips were accused of promoting the SafeMoon token with misleading information. In May 2022, multiple SafeMoon investors filed another class action lawsuit for security fraud. The lawsuit was voluntarily terminated in November 2022. In December 2021, SafeMoon developed Version 2 of their token, SafeMoon V2, and set a deadline for token migration to avoid a 100% tax. They also introduced a decentralized exchange called \"Safemoon Swap.\" In April 2022, they introduced the Safemoon card, a 2.5% fee debit card for goods using SafeMoon and other cryptocurrencies. However, the card's release has been delayed, causing criticism from experts. SafeMoon, like other cryptocurrencies, operates on decentralized blockchain technology. This means there is no central authority controlling or governing the network. Decentralization can enhance security, transparency, and censorship resistance, as no single entity has full control over the platform. Note that SafeMoon has received criticisms for manipulation, as even decentralized currencies can be controlled. Part of SafeMoon's transaction fee is added to the liquidity pool, which is essentially a smart contract holding a reserve of the token. This liquidity pool can provide stability to the token's price by ensuring that there are funds available for trading even during periods of high volatility. The transaction fee that is distributed to existing token holders can incentivize people to hold their tokens. Long-term holders can benefit from increased token balances without having to actively participate in yield farming or staking. While the primary focus of SafeMoon is not explicitly on yield farming or staking, the reflective tokenomics model can create opportunities for holders to earn passive income. Some users might choose to participate in yield farming on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that support SafeMoon or stake their tokens in protocols offering rewards. Despite several advantages, there remain a vast number of downsides to SafeMoon. The obvious downside of SafeMoon is the future public perception of the cryptocurrency. The success of SafeMoon, like many other cryptocurrencies, is heavily reliant on community sentiment. Because SafeMoon has faced several lawsuits and allegations of fraud, it remains to be seen whether the cryptocurrency will experience growth or strong user adoption in the future. Cryptocurrencies, including SafeMoon, are known for their price volatility. Price fluctuations can occur rapidly and unpredictably, leading to significant gains for some investors but also substantial losses for others. This was most notably seen during the 2022 lawsuit filing when SafeMoon lost nearly all of its value. Beyond speculative trading and holding for potential price appreciation, SafeMoon has limited practical use cases. Also, even though it has existed for several years, SafeMoon is a relatively new project compared to more established cryptocurrencies with undefined schedules and unproven roadmap execution. Smaller cryptocurrencies like SafeMoon also might have limited liquidity compared to more established tokens. Though it does transmit some fees to liquidity pools, limited liquidity can make it difficult for holders to execute large trades at desired prices, making it possible but unprofitable to exist an investment position at times. Last and perhaps most importantly, SafeMoon remains a speculative investment with an unproven business model that has yet to experience wide adoption. In certain contexts, SafeMoon may be seen as a \"rug pull\", as many investors likely lost lots of money due to the legal ramifications of 2022. This is not to say future performance of SafeMoon may play out the same way; still, a downside of SafeMoon is the historical context of several price volatility leading to losses. Like many cryptocurrencies, exists on decentralized blockchain Operates a (relatively small) liquidity pool Operates a reflection mechanism which benefits long-term holders May present investors with DeFi opportunities Has experience material price volatility (without having rebounded close to all-time highs) Has experienced numerous fraud and legal allegations Has yet to materialize large-scale real-world uses Tends to demonstrate Ponzi-like features May be larger to sell due to smaller liquidity pools May have negative public sentiment due to media coverage of fraud (i.e. Coffeezilla coverage) With this information in hand, should you still decide SafeMoon is the type of investment best suited for your portfolio, there are crypto exchanges where you can buy SafeMoon. Crypto exchanges are platforms where a diverse ecosystem of cryptocurrencies can be bought or sold. However, investors must understand that not all coins can be bought with fiat but with other coins. One such coin is SafeMoon as it isn't listed on any centralized exchange that accepts fiat currency. While SafeMoon isn't available on the Coinbase or Binance centralized exchanges, you can still buy the tokens on these exchanges using the steps outlined below. Step 1: Download the wallet and sign up You can install your wallet on your computer or browser extension or directly download it via mobile app stores such as the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. After downloading the wallet, you must set a username that should be kept safe. Step 2: Securing your recovery phase After downloading a wallet and setting up the username, a 12-word recovery phrase will be presented to you for safekeeping. This recovery phrase is a key to your crypto that helps you retain your wallet should your device get damaged or lost. Remember that you aren\u2019t supposed to share this phrase with anyone. Writing it out and keeping it in a safe is ideal. Step 3: Check to ensure you have enough Ethereum to cover fees The cost of a transaction depends on how busy the Ethereum network is, how quickly you want the transaction to be processed, and the size of the transaction. Ethereum network fees are also known as gas fees. Step 4: Buy and transfer Ethereum to the wallet Once you have met the user verification requirement, you can transfer cash to your wallet and proceed to buy some Ethereum coins with it. After purchase, the Ether (ETH) coins will be stored in the Ethereum wallet. Step 5: Use the Ether (ETH) to buy SafeMoon With your ETH in the wallet, you can swap ETH coins for SafeMoon directly. All you need to do is click the \u201cswap\u201d icon in the assets tab, choose SafeMoon, and swap ETH for the value of SafeMoon you desire. There are several requirements needed to open an exchange account. For decentralized exchanges, the process is pretty simple: Download the software or browser extension, set up an account, and store your recovery phase. For centralized exchanges, you are expected to meet the know-your-customer (KYC) verification requirement before being able to fund your account and trade. Things needed to open an exchange account are explained below. Unlike traditional brokerage firms, cryptocurrency exchanges are not members of the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC). Therefore, unless user terms specify otherwise, investors with cryptocurrency assets commingled on a custodial cryptocurrency exchange could potentially lose their funds as\u00a0unsecured creditors. Exchanges often mandate customers to provide their personal information to meet KYC requirements as mandated by regulatory authorities. Examples of personal information required include: Every exchange has a range of deposits that users must fund their accounts with. For example, Coinbase and Binance require users to deposit a minimum of $50 and $10, respectively, to complete their trades. Centralized exchanges are custodial platforms that enable users to exchange their crypto assets safely. Though secure, these exchanges take custody of a user's private key which is needed to authorize transactions. Authorities or businesses that control centralized exchanges have the sole right to make decisions regarding the platform. Centralized exchanges have sustainable liquidity as they can partner with platforms that provide them with liquidity. Decentralized exchanges are platforms that give users sole custody of their private keys and require the consent of the community to make key decisions regarding the platform. Decentralized platforms eliminate the need for third parties, making transactions cheaper than centralized exchanges. Additionally, users risk losing access to their accounts should they lose their recovery phase. Hybrid exchanges are becoming quite popular. These exchanges combine the features of centralized and decentralized exchanges, allowing users to trade crypto seamlessly. As a crypto investor, there are factors you should consider when creating an exchange account. These factors include: Security: With the current activities of fraudsters, exchanges that protect and update their security architecture constantly have high trading volumes. When opening an account, you should check if the platform has multi-layer verification for withdrawals, two-factor authentication, or if it\u2019s custodial. Fees: From buying fees to swapping and exchanging fees, it\u2019s often advised to compare the best in the industry before making a choice. However, security should not be compromised. Number and quality of coins supported: It\u2019s important to check the number of coins an exchange supports, especially if you want to diversify your investment portfolio. Research the quality of coins in the exchange to avoid investing in scam tokens. Wallet safety and quality: Before choosing an exchange, you should ensure it has a reputation for security. Storage and custody: This feature has to do with if an exchange takes custody of your private keys or gives you the responsibility of holding them. Depending on your preferences, you may choose either a custodial or non-custodial wallet. While centralized and decentralized exchanges exist to trade crypto assets, the difference is based on how they do it and their mode of operation. Factors that differentiate both include regulation, supported coins, liquidity, security, user experience, and custody. While centralized exchanges are more regulated, support several coins, have more liquidity, are less secure, have a great user experience, and take custody of users' private keys, decentralized exchanges are not. Even though the crypto industry is at its early stage in terms of regulation, centralized exchanges are striving to comply with financial regulations. Regulation works to protect investors and their investments. In November 2022, the world\u2019s second-largest crypto exchange, FTX, collapsed and immediately filed for bankruptcy. Its books showed the exchange lacked tangible reserves and court filings alleged the exchange indiscriminately used customers' funds for both operational and personal use. Being a centralized exchange, key decisions were taken without the knowledge of the community. To prevent issues such as this, decentralized exchanges may just be a great fit. These exchanges are built on-chain and all information regarding them is available to the public. Above all, decisions can only be made after token holders have voted in favor of them. Though there may be a bit of controversy, SafeMoon works to encourage long-term investment and discourage selling by charging users a 10% fee, with 50% of this being distributed to existing SafeMoon users. SafeMoon can serve as a means of investment, especially if you plan to leverage the reward and incentivization program. To achieve this, use the SafeMoon Swap decentralized application on the Build and Build chain and swap BNB coins for SafeMoon tokens. Then simply hold the tokens to qualify for rewards from transaction fees generated by the platform. Launched in 2021, SafeMoon is still relatively new, quite volatile with low trading volumes, and not listed on exchanges that accept fiat. These are signs that the token may be lacking in terms of regulation. Hence, it\u2019s still quite early to say if the token is safe or not.  It's important to remember that crypto assets are high-risk investments. Therefore, conducting thorough research is essential before making the decision to add SafeMoon to your crypto portfolio. SafeMoon is a relatively new cryptocurrency with unique tokenomics featuring a 10% transaction fee that redistributes 5% to existing holders and adds 5% to the liquidity pool. It aims to incentivize long-term holding and price stability. However, it has seen its fair share of allegations of fraud, and investors are encouraged to do independent research before deciding whether to invest in SafeMoon.

Learn what it takes to buy metaverse crypto Alex is a banker-turned-bitcoiner who ditched the bond trading desk for working remotely from all corners of the world, creating engaging and educational content for Bitcoin startups and crypto media publications.\u00a0 After working as a Corporate Bond Trader at Royal Bank of Scotland and a Fixed Income Salesperson at Australia & New Zealand Bank, Alex has been able to bring his deep knowledge of the capital markets into the brave new world of crypto finance. Metaverse crypto tokens have emerged as a new sub-asset class within the crypto markets, attracting investors who want to get in early on what could turn out to become the next iteration of the internet. Early-stage versions of the metaverse, such as Decentraland and Sandbox, are powered by cryptocurrencies that act as currencies in these virtual worlds. For investors, they offer an avenue to gain investment exposure to this new and fast-growing industry. Investing in cryptocurrencies, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and other Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and the markets can be extremely volatile. Consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions. This article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies nor can the accuracy or timeliness of the information be guaranteed. Metaverse crypto is a sub-set of cryptocurrencies that enable users of blockchain-powered virtual worlds to buy and sell digital assets, such as virtual land, real estate, or avatar items.\u00a0Like all crypto assets, however, they are high-risk investments, which means conducting thorough research is essential before making the decision to add metaverse tokens into your crypto portfolio. While leading metaverse tokens, such as Decentraland\u2019s MANA, Sandbox\u2019s SAND, and Axie Infinity\u2019s AXS, experienced incredible price rallies in the 2021 crypto bull market, their prices collapsed in 2022 alongside the rest of the crypto market, highlighting the riskiness of this sub-asset class. The metaverse has also attracted major global brands looking at new avenues to build their brand, reach new customers, and increase customer loyalty.\u00a0Nike and Gucci, for example, have already taken the leap, exploring ways that NFTs could add to their customer experiences. Nike has purchased NFT fashion startup RTFKT, with the aim to sell Nike shoes in the metaverse, while Gucci hosted its very own Gucci Vault Land in the Sandbox metaverse late last year. Buying metaverse coins works the same way as buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other digital currency on a crypto exchange.\u00a0Cryptocurrency exchanges are online trading platforms similar to traditional online brokers like Fidelity or Charles Schwab\u2013that enable you to buy and sell digital currencies for U.S. dollars or other cryptocurrencies. Here\u2019s how it works! Step 1: Sign up for a crypto exchange Choose a reputable crypto exchange, like Coinbase, Kraken, or Uphold, where you can buy metaverse tokens by depositing U.S. dollars using a payment method that suits you. Register an account and complete the exchange\u2019s customer onboarding process. Step 2: Confirm your payment details. Next, you need to choose the payment method you want to use to fund your trading account. Wire transfers are typically accepted by all U.S.-based crypto exchanges. Step 3: Select the metaverse token you want to buy, view the current market price, and press \u201cbuy.\u201d Once you have funded your account, choose the metaverse token(s) you want to purchase, place an order for the amount you want to buy, and wait for your order to be filled. If you place a market order, your purchase will be completed within seconds and the tokens will appear in your trading account\u2019s wallet. Alternatively, you could also purchase metaverse coins on peer-to-peer trading platforms. Unlike on centralized crypto exchanges where you place an order that goes into an order book for a specific cryptocurrency pair, on a peer-to-peer marketplace you can purchase cryptocurrencies directly from another individual using a predetermined payment method and for an agreed price. Moreover, you could also swap cryptocurrencies you already hold for metaverse tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Decentralized exchanges only require you to connect your crypto wallet to the trading platform\u2019s smart contract, enabling you to swap one token for another without requiring you to create a trading account or complete a customer verification process. Unlike traditional brokerage firms, cryptocurrency exchanges are not members of the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC). Therefore, unless user terms specify otherwise, investors with cryptocurrency assets commingled on a custodial cryptocurrency exchange could potentially lose their funds as\u00a0unsecured creditors. To open an account on a cryptocurrency exchange, there are certain requirements. Let\u2019s take a look at them. The personal information and documentation required to complete a crypto exchange\u2019s onboarding process typically includes: Every exchange requires customers to make a minimum deposit to start trading. The minimum deposit differs from exchange to exchange but is typically between $10 to $20. Some crypto trading apps, such as Robinhood, even allow you to start with as little as $1. Centralized crypto exchanges are online trading platforms akin to traditional online brokerages where traders and investors can buy and sell cryptocurrencies after completing a customer onboarding process and depositing U.S. dollars to fund their trading accounts. Decentralized crypto exchanges are trading platforms where smart contracts replace a centralized orderbook, enabling crypto traders and investors to swap tokens for one another simply by connecting their crypto wallets. No identity verification is required. Arguably the most compelling argument for trading on decentralized exchanges is that situations like the FTX collapse cannot affect user funds as assets are held in users\u2019 wallets, separate from a centralized exchange wallet. Therefore, if a decentralized exchange gets hacked or the company operating it goes bankrupt, user funds remain unaffected. Hybrid crypto exchanges combine a centralized orderbook to match trades with decentralized token storage to enable crypto traders to experience the best of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Decentraland\u2019s MANA token is the leading virtual world\u2019s in-platform currency, which enables users to transact in the early-stage metaverse. From buying parcels of virtual land to buying wearable items, MANA is required to make it happen. The Sandbox has been able to attract some of the biggest artists, influencers, and brands to the metaverse by offering a versatile virtual world, powered by the SAND token. Like Decentraland\u2019s MANA, SAND acts as the in-world currency required to make transactions. Axie Infinity is arguably one of the most popular metaverse-esque blockchain games, enabling players to battle their in-game avatars\u2013called Axies\u2013in various virtual lands, with the winners earning tokens. AXS is the game\u2019s governance token that allows players to make decisions about the game\u2019s development. It is also used in the game\u2019s NFT marketplace as a transactional currency. Security: A high level of security is arguably the most important aspect of a reputable crypto exchange. Ensure that you choose an exchange with a strong cybersecurity track record that has not experienced any hacks. Fees: Trading fees and other exchange fees (such as withdrawal fees) can eat into your returns. Ensure that you choose an exchange with low fees to mitigate the impact of fees on your trading revenues. Number and quality of supported cryptocurrencies: If you are looking to purchase metaverse tokens, make sure the exchange you choose supports the assets you would like to purchase. While most leading exchanges support the top metaverse tokens, some offer more liquidity than others. Wallet safety: Choose an exchange that provides secure crypto wallets, ideally with added safety features such as withdrawal wallet whitelisting.\u00a0Address whitelisting is a security feature provided by numerous crypto exchanges that only allows cryptocurrency withdrawals to specific \u201cwhitelisted\u201d external wallet addresses predefined by the user. Storage and custody: Ensure that the crypto exchange you choose holds most, if not all, customer assets in cold storage to mitigate the risk of theft of your assets held on the exchange. Centralized vs. decentralized: While decentralized exchanges arguably offer the more secure trading avenue, centralized exchanges are typically regulated (at least to some degree), thus providing more customer protection than their unregulated decentralized counterparts. Land Sales: The buying and selling of virtual land has become one of the most alluring earning opportunities in the metaverse. Some parcels of Land\u2013virtual land sold in the form of NFTs in Decentraland\u2013have been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Digital Asset Creation: By creating and selling new digital assets\u2013typically in the form of NFTs\u2013metaverse users can earn crypto. Selling Accessories: Avatars can be customized with various items, such as clothes and shoes. These can be bought and sold as NFTs, enabling metaverse users to make money in the metaverse. Providing Services: Like in the \u201creal\u201d world, metaverse users can offer services to earn crypto, such as promoting brands by offering virtual advertising space or acting as a virtual tour guide through the metaverse. Hosting Events: Hosting virtual events, such as concerts and art shows, has emerged as a popular way to earn revenue in the metaverse. It's important to remember that, like all crypto assets, metaverse crypto assets are high-risk investments. Therefore, conducting thorough research is essential before making the decision to add metaverse tokens to your crypto portfolio. Robinhood. \"How to start investing with as little as $1.\""

            "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: Celebrating the 10,000 BTC Pizza Order",
            "content": "Each year, May 22 marks the anniversary of the day a Florida man paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas in the first Bitcoin transaction. The day has become legendary, first because it was the first commercial use of bitcoins, but more so because of Bitcoin\u2019s worth in the following years. For the two pizzas, the man in question paid a fortune at today's prices. On\u00a0May 22, 2010, now known\u00a0as \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day,\u201d\u00a0Laszlo Hanyecz, the Florida man,\u00a0agreed to pay 10,000 bitcoins for the delivery of two Papa John\u2019s pizzas.\u00a0On the Bitcoin Talk forum, Hanyecz reached out for help. \u201cI\u2019ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas \u2026 like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day,\u201d Hanyecz wrote. \u201cI like having left over pizza to nibble on later.\u00a0You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I\u2019m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don\u2019t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a \u2018breakfast platter\u2019 at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you\u2019re happy!\u201d A British man took up\u00a0Hanyecz\u2019s offer and bought the two pizzas for him in exchange for 10,000 bitcoins. Even then, the recipient of the bitcoins got a bargain,\u00a0paying about $25 for the pizzas, while 10,000 bitcoins were then worth around $41. Since that purchase, Hanyeczs\u2019 pizzas have become far more costly. Nine months after the purchase,\u00a0Bitcoin reached parity with the U.S. dollar, making the two pizzas worth $10,000. In 2015, the fifth anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day, the two pizzas were valued at $2.4 million. On May 22, 2023, Bitcoin was at just over $26,850, making the pizzas worth\u2026you get the point. Despite the massive rise in the price of Bitcoin, Hanyecz says he is not phased about his deal. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,\u201d Hanyecz has said. Yes, a person paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas in 2010, when its prices were far less than today. Bitcoin Pizza Day is May 22, commemorating a 10,000 BTC pizza purchase. According to the conversation on Bitcoin Forum in 2014, 1 BTC on May 22, 2010 was worth $0.0041, making the purchase amount $41. Bitcoin's value has gone up significantly since the first Bitcoin Pizza Day, illustrating the cryptocurrency's impressive growth since its early days, when its worth was fungible for not more than a couple of pizzas. The rise in Bitcoin's value is a testament to its increasing acceptance and use in digital transactions worldwide. However, Bitcoin is highly volatile. Its price can fluctuate rapidly, potentially leading to momentous gains or significant losses. Thus, while the growth trajectory of Bitcoin attracts investors, caution and informed decision-making are paramount when investing in this cryptocurrency because of its elevated risk.

            "title": "What Is XRP?",
            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. XRP is a cryptocurrency and native token of XRP Ledger, an open-source blockchain. The cryptocurrency and blockchain are designed to enhance global financial transfers and the exchange of several currencies. Investors also use it to store value and profit from price fluctuations. XRP and the XRP Ledger are also used by blockchain services company Ripple on its payment platform to facilitate transactions between financial institutions, businesses, and organizations. It's common to see Ripple (the company) associated with ownership of XRP and XRP Ledger. Ripple does not own the blockchain or the cryptocurrency, but it contributes by running six of the unique nodes on the XRPL network. In 2011, Jed McCaleb, David Schwartz, and Arthur Britto started developing the XRP Ledger as a recourse to the inherent limitations of Bitcoin. In 2012, when the XRP Ledger was launched, its native token, XRP, was created to aid its function. The three developers released XRP and XRP Ledger in 2012 and were joined shortly after by Chris Larsen, and the Opencoin company was formed. The goal behind the XRP Ledger was similar to the vision of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, which was to foster an easier, faster, and more secure way to make transactions globally. The key difference, however, is that it has always been marketed toward businesses rather than consumers, although everyone can use it. Ripple was the name of the original open-source project, which included XRP (at the time called \"ripples\"), the Ripple Consensus Ledger, the Ripple Transaction Protocol, and the Ripple Network. The Opencoin company helped develop the XRP Ledger, but it was rebranded to Ripple Labs (now known as Ripple). It maintained its involvement in the project, which was and remains open source. The XRP Ledger Foundation was launched in 2020 and funded by donations from Ripple and a few other businesses to maintain and continue developing the XRP Ledger. Although XRP is often referred to as Ripple, it\u2019s important to understand that XRP is an open-source cryptocurrency independent of Ripple (the company), which is a cryptocurrency services and technology company. Due to its reported fast, efficient, reliable, carbon-neutral delivery, XRP is the technology that Ripple uses in its solutions. XRP operates on its decentralized, open-source blockchain, the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Unlike most cryptocurrencies, XRP is pre-mined, with a maximum token supply of 100 billion. The token\u2019s total supply was/are distributed in three ways: The initial idea behind XRP was straightforward: it was described as a peer-to-peer trust network. XRPL and Ripple cite XRP as a faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient digital asset that can process transactions within seconds and consume less energy than some counterpart cryptocurrencies. About 55% of XRP tokens are in circulation. XRP is used by Ripple to serve as a settlement layer facilitating the transactions occurring on Ripple Net, Ripple's commercial platform. It has been traded as a cryptocurrency and is available on several exchanges, including futures, options, swap exchanges, spot exchanges, custodial exchanges, and non-custodial exchanges. It is important to note that the mechanism behind XRP transactions doesn't require a transaction fee, which is a standard feature for most cryptocurrencies. Instead, it requires the sender to burn a tiny portion of the XRP, which positions XRP as deflationary. When a cryptocurrency is described as inflationary or deflationary, it refers to its internal value on a blockchain, not its market value. However, some investors believe that some cryptocurrencies provide protection from inflation, usually because price increases of the popular ones outpace it. There are some similarities between XRP and BTC, but there are many more differences. Some of these include the following. The consensus mechanisms used in validating transactions are different. XRP uses a unique consensus mechanism that relies on trusted validators or a Unique Node List (UNL) that decides what transaction to consider for the next ledger. For transactions to become valid, most trusted validators need to agree. On the other hand, Bitcoin relies on miners to solve complex mathematical problems\u2014using proof of work\u2014in validating transactions. XRP\u2019s unique consensus mechanism (XRPL Consensus, also called Federated Consensus) allows it to authenticate transactions faster and cheaper. This process consumes far less energy. It\u2019s the opposite for bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies, whose mining processes cause transaction confirmations to take longer and cost far more. The XRP ledger is reportedly scalable up to 1,500 transactions per second. With its Payment Channels, it can theoretically scale up to tens of thousands of transactions per second. Payment Channels are opened between transacting parties. The XRP is flagged by the blockchain so that it isn't spent again, and the parties can send and receive payments while the channel is open. The payments are settled in bulk when the channel is closed. This allows thousands of transactions to be settled at once without tying up the blockchain's consensus apparatus. It depends on your outlook for the market and other cryptocurrencies. It's best to talk to a financial advisor familiar with cryptocurrencies to see if it is suitable for your investing goals. All cryptocurrency prices are volatile, and there is a significant risk of loss. It's best to discuss XRP with a financial advisor to determine the effect it would have on your portfolio and whether it is safe to invest in it. XRP is really no different than many other cryptocurrencies. It is the native token of a blockchain that operates like several others. Its position in the market is a function of investor belief and hope and how much they are willing to buy and sell it for. XRP remains one of the top cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap. It can be used just like any other digital currency for transactions or as an investment. If you choose to invest, however, be sure that you don\u2019t invest more than you can afford to lose.

            "title": "What Is the FSB Report on Crypto Regulations?",
            "content": "Jacob Wade has been a nationally-recognized personal finance expert for the past decade. He has written professionally for The Balance, LendingTree, CompareCards, Investing Answers, and other widely-followed sites. Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), a global financial authority, proposed a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies to the nations with the 20 largest economies (known as the G-20 nations), outlining concerns about crypto markets and activities. The proposal calls for stricter regulation of crypto assets, namely stablecoins, and a clear framework outlining risks and compliance for crypto regulation. The report was submitted in October 2022 by the chairman of the FSB ahead of meetings with key leaders in Washington, D.C., as well as the upcoming G-20 worldwide summit for 2022. The report also includes a list of questions for public comment to help shape the proposed set of regulations. The report, titled International Regulation of Crypto-asset Activities, first outlines the current challenges and risks of regulations in the cryptocurrency space, stating that \u201cmany crypto-asset activities and markets are not compliant with applicable regulations or are unregulated.\u201d The report goes on to detail the reasons for a strong stance on crypto regulation. With the current crypto winter in full swing, investors have seen their holdings diminish\u2014and, in some cases, disappear\u2014due to the risks taken by some crypto companies. The FSB states, \u201cThese vulnerabilities were amplified by a lack of transparency and disclosures, flawed governance, inadequate consumer and investor protections, and weaknesses in risk management.\u201d Stablecoins are in the crosshairs of the FSB report, \u201cas they could pose significant risks to financial stability.\u201d The FSB\u2019s harsh stance on stablecoins is congruent with its call for regulation on stablecoins in July 2022. As stablecoins attempt to mirror pricing of real-world assets (such as the U.S. dollar), this is seen as a threat to current central banks and national financial systems. The report also attempts to parse some of the intricacies of the many functions of crypto assets, as some cryptocurrencies are compliant with current regulations, while others are not. Another challenge is the lack of classification for crypto assets, making regulation difficult. One of the biggest challenges is that crypto companies may offer multiple use cases (such as trading, lending, custody, and brokerage services) that should be regulated individually. Traditional finance companies that offer these services are typically regulated as discrete providers of the services, instead of under a single company umbrella. Finally, the report states, \u201cthe cross-border nature of crypto-assets raises regulatory, supervisory and enforcement challenges.\u201d The FSB is calling for international cooperation in creating a cohesive regulatory framework for crypto assets that can be used in multiple jurisdictions around the world. The FSB proposes an approach to build a regulatory framework for crypto assets, starting with the principle of \u201csame activity, same risk, same regulation.\u201d This means applying existing regulations from the traditional finance world to crypto assets and crypto companies that offer financial services, such as lending, trading, and brokerage services. There are two main proposals in the report: Regulation and oversight: The FSB is building a comprehensive set of proposed recommendations for \u201cthe regulation, supervision and oversight of crypto-asset activities and markets.\u201d These recommendations will continue to evolve but are designed to help G-20 countries create clear international regulations to govern all cryptocurrencies and intermediaries (such as crypto exchanges). Additions to the Stablecoin Arrangement: The Stablecoin Arrangement is a document created by the FSB that includes numerous updates in the latest proposal, including \u201crequiring these stablecoin issuers to provide robust legal claim, guarantee timely redemption at par into fiat, and maintain effective stabilisation mechanisms, among other revisions.\u201d Effectively, the FSB is recommending the centralization of stablecoin governance, with accountable parties for regulation, as well as guaranteed timely redemption for users who want to exchange into fiat currency. The FSB is calling for the G-20 nations to take crypto regulation seriously, and to act swiftly to impose the same regulations that traditional financial markets have on crypto assets. The board is also calling for regulation unique to cryptocurrencies, as some of their uses and functionality are very different from any traditional asset. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is an agency that acts as a watchdog for the global financial system, offering regulatory guidance to central banks and policy makers around the world. The goal of the FSB is to create financial stability in international financial markets. While the FSB is designed to help all world economies, it regularly reports to the G-20, which comprises the 20 largest economies in the world. No. But the FSB is responsible for monitoring global financial markets and making official recommendations to the largest economies in the world about financial regulations. This includes recommendations regarding the regulation of cryptocurrencies and crypto-related companies. The Financial Stability Board report says that its regulation proposals will be finalized in mid-2023. These proposals will give a clear direction for regulators and policy makers on how to legally rein in cryptocurrencies and intermediaries that provide crypto-related services. While the FSB is focused on crypto market activities and stablecoins, it will continue to monitor the activities of decentralized finance (DeFi) markets and companies as well. The FSB is taking a harsh stance on crypto, specifically stablecoins, due to the huge risks involved in such pegged assets. It calls out Terra (LUNA) in particular, as it is the most egregious example to date of a highly risky stablecoin collapsing and erasing billions in value seemingly overnight. The FSB will continue to offer guidance to global financial regulators ahead of finalizing these regulatory proposals in 2023.

            "content": "Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. Investopedia / Joules Garcia Splinterlands is an online collectible card game using blockchain technology. Every card in the game is owned as a non-fungible token (NFT) and is traded using similar features to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. If you\u2019ve ever played collectible trading card games like Magic: The Gathering or Pokemon, you\u2019ll find a similar experience with Splinterlands, but through a web browser and blockchain wallet. Cards are available to buy and sell through third-party online marketplaces. Winners can earn real money, making it a lucrative platform for extremely skilled players with the best cards. Splinterlands works on the Ethereum blockchain and requires players to create an account or connect an existing Web3 wallet like MetaMask to get started. Splinterlands is a card-based online game. Players collect a deck of cards, which is then used to play in a battle against other players. Each card has a unique feature or attribute, making characters stronger and more likely to win. As Splinterlands is a \u201cplay-to-win\u201d crypto game, players can win real money in the game. Users can choose a free mode where they can\u2019t win real money prizes or a paid model where they can earn any kind of prize when signing up. New players need a \u201cSummoner\u2019s Spellbook,\u201d which costs $10, to begin. As of July 2022, the cost of Splinterlands cards on third-party marketplaces ranges from around 0.01 to around 1 ETH each. The game launched in 2018. Players buy and collect cards to play and win against other players (although the cards can also be collectibles). In-game battles allow you to pick a lineup of characters called summoners and monsters. Monsters can perform various types of attacks or dozens of abilities. Cards have different stats making them more or less powerful. Some of the attributes on the cards include: The game gets its name from Splinters, which is one of six different character categories of players using different elements in battle. Splinters use in-game language for names, and the main elements used are earth, fire, water, life, death, dragon, and neutral mercenaries. There is a growing library of more than 500 cards available to collect. The game uses an in-game currency called Dark Energy Crystals, which players use to buy items. Popular marketplaces with Splinterlands support include OpenSea, PeakMonsters, and Monster Market if you want to purchase cards outside of the game. The app is also compatible with the Tron and WAX blockchains. Players can earn real money playing Splinterlands in several ways: As of July 2022, the game has paid out more than $6 million in prizes to tournament winners, according to the game\u2019s official website. Other prizes include card packs, collectible cards, magic potions, and Dark Energy Crystals. Collectors can also make money selling the cards they get through the game in marketplaces like OpenSea. If you win a rare card, it may be valuable to another player. If someone has a rare card that they don\u2019t want to part with, cards are also rentable. When cards are rented, players earn a payment, and the renter gets temporary exclusive rights to use the card, powered by the underlying blockchain. Splinterlands rentals work through online contracts. Rentals are made in one-day intervals and are cancelable. Funds are held in an escrow process using smart contracts to ensure that lenders are fairly compensated. Cards are automatically returned to the owner at the end of the rental period. Rewards are distributed at the end of in-game seasons and tournaments. Players can also earn daily quest rewards and tournament rewards. Rewards come as reward chests that players can open to access Dark Energy Crystals, potions, or cards in the virtual chest. Hive Engine is the smart contract platform utilized by Splinterlands. The engine uses the independent HIVE Blockchain to facilitate in-game rewards and card rentals. Users can transfer assets between blockchains, including the HIVE Blockchain, using their digital wallets and Splinterlands transfer features.

Cryptocurrency influencers must know how the technology works and stay aware of any relevant news about the crypto space. To become an influencer, you will need to fully understand what investing in cryptocurrency is all about. Then, simply choose a social media platform (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, X, or a mix of any of these) where you can provide your unique insights. Many cryptocurrency influencers give predictions and share their thoughts on what's happening in the space. You have to look at their track record and history to determine whether or not they're legitimate. It's also important to remember that the cryptocurrency space is highly volatile, making it nearly impossible to predict what exactly is going to happen next. You can share your opinions on cryptocurrency via social media. However, if you're promoting a product as an affiliate, you have to disclose your relationship with that sponsor to your audience to avoid any potential issues with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Following cryptocurrency influencers may help you learn more about a complicated, ever-changing financial topic. Influencers are also a great way to stay on top of crypto-related trends. That being said, if you\u2019re struggling with finances and looking for solutions, you may want to focus on saving and investing money into something that you understand first. You may also want to consider working with a trusted financial advisor. Influencers are an accessible resource for crypto-related news and information, but their advice can only go so far in relating to your personal finance needs.

            "content": "Jose Martinez Calderon / Getty Images Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are similar to cryptocurrencies but with key differences. While transactions for both are recorded on blockchain ledgers, NFTs also represent ownership in a digital or real asset\u2014anything from computer-generated media to sports trading cards, or physical artwork. So, should you invest in NFTs? That depends on whether the items they represent are authentic, hold value, and stand to gain from being tokenized. Open to the general public Convenient digital means of establishing and verifying ownership of any type of asset Mitigates conflict in ownership claims Own portions of an asset that may not otherwise be fractionalized Susceptible to market manipulation Potential for fraud, scams, and money laundering Tradeoffs of self-managing security Doesn't prevent disputes, theft, and infringement Added investment analysis of underlying asset Investors have many reasons to want to buy and sell assets that are tokenized into NFTs. Some advantages include: Investing in tokenized assets through NFTs can also come with disadvantages, including: Whether an NFT is a good investment depends on the investor. Investors buy and sell NFTs for many reasons. Some are interested in owning the underlying asset, and others may perceive value in tokenizing an asset into an NFT. Some investors might simply enjoy speculating on its potential to appreciate. Tokenized assets can be purchased publicly through NFT marketplaces and some cryptocurrency exchanges and privately through brokers and dealers, including auction houses such as Sotheby's and Christie's. Many online NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea, Rarible, NBA Top Shot, Super Rare, and Nifty Gateway, require owning a specific blockchain's native token to buy an NFT\u2014usually in ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform. It depends on the NFT. According to OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces, hundreds of thousands of NFTs are sold daily for gaming, collecting, and other hobbies. Investing in NFTs has just as many benefits as downsides. In general, NFTs should be purchased if the tokenized asset has an established market and interests you\u2014otherwise, it's unlikely the NFT will experience price appreciation and that you'll be happy owning it following your purchase.

            "content": "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and ordinals are assets that are tokenized using a blockchain. Because blockchains use energy, NFTs can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change through their production, exchange, and storage. Learn more about NFTs and ordinals, their environmental impacts, and steps users can take to be more aware. NFTs are generally built on Ethereum or blockchains similar to it. Ordinals are similar to NFTs but created on the Bitcoin blockchain or blockchains like it. Depending on the programming and design of the blockchain on which these NFTs and ordinals reside, these transactions can consume significant amounts of energy. This article uses \"NFT\" to refer to NFTs and ordinals for brevity. Energy consumption occurs when an NFT is minted, bought, sold, and stored. Here's a look at each of these stages of the NFT lifecycle: Minting an NFT is a separate transaction on a blockchain, as is transferring ownership during a sale. All transactions use energy. NFTs also require storage, even if there isn't transaction activity. These tokenized assets are generally digital assets such as documents, images, and videos, all requiring digital space. Blockchains themselves are not equipped to store these assets, so only the tokens (alphanumeric sequences that are the result of hashed data) are stored on the blockchains. The assets are stored elsewhere, such as on the interplanetary file system (IPFS). The IPFS was created as a decentralized and distributed storage system for platforms that need it, like blockchains. Data storage requires energy. As the number of NFTs grows, the overall energy consumption and storage space of NFTs are likely to increase. In addition to energy consumption, electronic waste (e-waste) is an issue. If a blockchain relies on mining, like Bitcoin does, hardware is continuously improved and upgraded. Mining typically uses hardware such as central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to solve increasingly difficult cryptographic problems. This hardware can quickly become outdated\u2014it's also subject to 24-hour 100% usage, which wears electronic circuits out. Updating and replacing faulty equipment creates tons of e-waste. E-waste contains hazardous materials, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can leach into the environment if improperly disposed of. Additionally, the processing of e-waste is energy-intensive and can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Hardware that isn't recycled ends up in landfills, releasing toxins into the environment. Recycling e-waste significantly lowers the energy consumption of manufacturing new electronic products by reducing the mining and processing of new raw materials, particularly precious metals. Given the potential environmental impact of NFTs, there is a movement to develop more sustainable blockchain and NFT protocols. Additionally, artists, buyers, and sellers can choose to use NFT platforms and blockchains that use less energy. These would likely include less energy-intensive consensus mechanisms and, to a point, blockchains with hotspots in areas that use renewable energy sources. To determine blockchain sustainability, you must inspect where nodes are located and determine the significant energy sources in those areas. For example, the Ethereum network has 2,900 nodes (the most) in the U.S., the energy generation of which is 79% from petroleum, natural gas, and coal. The U.S. also has about 1,600 reachable Bitcoin nodes. It's safe to say that platforms using a blockchain with a significant presence in the U.S. are not as energy efficient as they could be. However, Ethereum uses less energy, so in the U.S. it's a better choice. Blockchain mining and hardware recycling often rely on burning fossil fuels, leaving a significant environmental footprint. Renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric energy, geothermal energy, and biomass energy, offer eco-friendly alternatives to power these operations. Shifting from Proof-of-Work (PoW), the consensus mechanism for Bitcoin and other mining-based blockchains, to more energy-efficient ones, such as Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model, can significantly reduce the environmental impact NFTs have. PoS eliminates the competitive mining and reward process altogether. PoS consumes significantly less energy than PoW because PoS does not require miners to expend energy in a competition to solve a cryptographic problem. Instead, PoS uses a system called staking, where validators who have staked cryptocurrency\u2014basically locking it from being used\u2014on the network are randomly chosen to verify transactions and propose new blocks. Ethereum is expected to consume about 5.36 gigawatt hours of electricity annually, while Bitcoin is expected to consume about 173.19 terawatt hours annually, more than Poland and Egypt. Some notable PoS blockchains include: Non-fungible tokens use energy because they require a blockchain network to conduct work verifying them as transactions. More transactions require more energy. Creating, selling, and buying an NFT require energy and hardware use, which can lead to pollution or e-waste that would not otherwise be necessary if they did not exist. It is hard to determine what one NFT costs regarding carbon generation, but it's safe to say that they add to human activities' total carbon output. NFTs leave a carbon footprint at every stage of their existence, but conscious choices and prioritizing eco-friendly practices in how they are created, traded, and stored can offset their potential impact on the environment. Cryptocurrency developers can reduce NFT energy consumption by improving or switching to less energy-intensive blockchain consensus mechanisms. NFT minting and hosting platforms can use blockchains that don't require large amounts of energy. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

            "title": "Non-Fungible Token (NFT): What It Means and How It Works",
            "content": "Understand how and why NFTs are being used today Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are assets like a piece of art, digital content, or video that have been tokenized via a blockchain. Tokens are unique identification codes created from metadata via an encryption function. These tokens are then stored on a blockchain, while the assets themselves are stored in other places. The connection between the token and the asset is what makes them unique. NFTs can be traded and exchanged for money, cryptocurrencies, or other NFTs\u2014it all depends on the value the market and owners have placed on them. For instance, you could draw a smiley face on a banana, take a picture of it (which has metadata attached to it), and tokenize it on a blockchain. Whoever has the private keys to that token owns whatever rights you have assigned to it. Cryptocurrencies are tokens as well; however, the key difference is that two cryptocurrencies from the same blockchain are interchangeable\u2014they are fungible. Two NFTs from the same blockchain can look identical, but they are not interchangeable. Investopedia / Julie Bang NFTs were created long before they became popular in the mainstream. Reportedly, the first NFT sold was \"Quantum,\" designed and tokenized by Kevin McKoy in 2014 on one blockchain (Namecoin), then minted on Ethereum and sold in 2021. NFTs are built following the ERC-721 (Ethereum Request for Comment #721) standard, which dictates how ownership is transferred, methods for confirming transactions, and how applications handle safe transfers (among other requirements). The ERC-1155 standard, approved six months after ERC-721, improves upon ERC-721 by batching multiple non-fungible tokens into a single contract, reducing transaction costs. In early March 2021, a group of NFTs by digital artist Beeple sold for over $69 million. The sale set a precedent and record for the most expensive digital art sold at the time. The artwork was a collage comprised of Beeple's first 5,000 days of work. NFTs are created through a process called minting, in which the asset's information is encrypted and recorded on a blockchain. At a high level, the minting process entails a new block being created, NFT information being validated by a validator, and the block being closed. This minting process often entails incorporating smart contracts that assign ownership and manage NFT transfers. As tokens are minted, they are assigned a unique identifier directly linked to one blockchain address. Each token has an owner, and the ownership information (i.e., the address in which the minted token resides) is publicly available. Even if 5,000 NFTs of the same exact item are minted (similar to general admission tickets to a movie), each token has a unique identifier and can be distinguished from the others. Many blockchains can create NFTs, but they might be called something different. For instance, on the Bitcoin blockchain, they are called Ordinals. Like an Ethereum-based NFT, a Bitcoin Ordinal can be bought, sold, and traded. The difference is Ethereum creates tokens for the asset, while Ordinals have serial numbers (called identifiers) assigned to satoshis\u2014the smallest bitcoin denomination. Like physical money, cryptocurrencies are usually fungible from a financial perspective, meaning that they can be traded or exchanged, one for another. For example, one bitcoin is always equal in value to another bitcoin on a given exchange, similar to how every dollar bill of U.S. currency has an implicit exchange value of $1. This fungibility characteristic makes cryptocurrencies suitable as a secure medium of transaction in the digital economy. For this reason, NFTs shift the crypto paradigm by making each token unique and irreplaceable, making it impossible for one non-fungible token to be \"equal\" to another. They are digital representations of assets and have been likened to digital passports because each token contains a unique, non-transferable identity to distinguish it from other tokens. They are also extensible, meaning you can combine one NFT with another to create a third, unique NFT\u2014the cryptocurrency industry calls this \"breeding.\" Perhaps the most famous use case for NFTs is that of cryptokitties. Launched in November 2017, cryptokitties are digital representations of cats with unique identifications on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. Each kitty is unique and has a different price. They \"reproduce\" among themselves and create new offspring with other attributes and valuations compared to their \"parents.\" Within a few short weeks of their launch, cryptokitties racked up a fan base that spent millions in ether to purchase, feed, and nurture them. Much of the earlier market for NFTs was centered around digital art and collectibles, but it has evolved into much more. For instance, the popular NFT marketplace OpenSea has several NFT categories: Perhaps the most apparent benefit of NFTs is market efficiency. Tokenizing a physical asset can streamline sales processes and remove intermediaries. NFTs representing digital or physical artwork on a blockchain can eliminate the need for agents and allow sellers to connect directly with their target audiences (assuming the artists know how to host their NFTs securely). NFTs can also be used to streamline investing. For example, consulting firm Ernst & Young developed an NFT solution for one of its fine wine investors\u2014by storing wine in a secure environment and using NFTs to protect provenance. Real estate can also be tokenized\u2014a property could be parceled into multiple sections, each containing different characteristics. For example, one of the sections might be on a lakeside, while another is closer to the forest. Depending on its features, each piece of land could be unique, priced differently, and represented by an NFT. Real estate trading, a complex and bureaucratic affair, could then be simplified by incorporating relevant metadata into a unique NFT associated with only the corresponding portion of the property. NFTs can represent ownership in a business, much like stocks\u2014in fact, stock ownership is already tracked via ledgers that contain information such as the stockholder's name, date of issuance, certificate number, and the number of shares. A blockchain is a distributed and secured ledger, so issuing NFTs to represent shares serves the same purpose as issuing stocks. The main advantage to using NFTs and blockchain instead of a stock ledger is that smart contracts can automate ownership transferral\u2014once an NFT share is sold, the blockchain can take care of everything else. Non-fungible tokens are also very useful in identity security. For example, personal information stored on an immutable blockchain cannot be accessed, stolen, or used by anyone who doesn't have the keys. NFTs can also democratize investing by fractionalizing physical assets. Fractionalized ownership through tokenization can extend to many assets. For instance, a painting need not always have a single owner\u2014tokenization allows multiple people to purchase a share of it, transferring ownership of a fraction of the physical painting to them. While there are numerous benefits for creators, owners, investors, and other interested parties, there are several issues that should concern you if you're considering investing or minting NFTs. The token represents ownership via hashed metadata and matching key pairs generated by your wallet. The image, video, music, or other digitized item can be copied and circulated without your permission using various techniques. It's very easy to copy an image by right-clicking on it and saving it. The person who does this to a tokenized digital asset is pirating the asset because there is established ownership. However, it is up to the owner to locate and file charges against the multitudes of people who might do this. Non-fungible tokens are also very limited by their liquidity. They attract a specific audience of collectors or buyers because they are much more specific than cryptocurrencies. If you find yourself holding an NFT you no longer want, it might be difficult to find a buyer if that type is no longer popular. It depends on what the NFT represents. If it is tokenized real estate, the NFT would be exchanged for the property's market value, which, if it has appreciated, would generate a return for the seller. If the NFT were an image of a monkey in a hat, it would depend on that specific token's market value. If its price had increased since it was last purchased, a seller would earn a profit. Non-fungible tokens can be valuable to the right person. To an investor, they might appreciate in value. To a collector, they might just be a collection they want to keep. Another person might only want to own it, yet another might consider it memorabilia of a specific moment they treasure. Non-fungible token (NFT) is the opposite of a fungible token, which describes the interchangeability of a token. For example, say you had three notes with identical smiley faces drawn on them. When you tokenize one of them, that note becomes distinguishable from the others\u2014it is non-fungible. The other two notes are indistinguishable, so they can each take the place of the other. The idea behind NFTs is to create tokens that represent ownership. The token could represent anything from a digital image to partial ownership of an interstellar spaceship. In theory, because they are created using blockchain technology, they are immutable, secure, and don't require the intervention of third parties. Non-fungible tokens are an evolution of the cryptocurrency concept. Modern finance systems consist of sophisticated trading and loan systems for different asset types, from real estate to lending contracts to artwork. By enabling digital representations of assets, NFTs are a step forward in the reinvention of this infrastructure. To be sure, the idea of digital representations of physical assets is not novel, nor is the use of unique identification. However, when these concepts are combined with the benefits of a tamper-resistant blockchain with smart contracts and automation, they become a potent force for change.

She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Crypto tokens are any tokens created using a blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are crypto tokens designed to be used as payment methods. There are two crypto commodities definitions used by various parties: cryptocurrencies are commodities, and crypto commodities are tokens representing an underlying asset. These three terms are often used interchangeably, but as you'll see, there are distinct differences. A token is a representation of something else. It could represent data, a person's security credentials, information stored within a database, or permissions to access a distributed ledger. Tokens issued through a blockchain are crypto tokens. This blanket term includes cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens, crypto commodities, security tokens, or any other virtual asset associated with a blockchain. Bitcoin's native token, bitcoin, is a crypto token, as is Ethereum's ether. Cryptocurrencies are crypto tokens issued using a blockchain, designed to be used as an alternate form of payment. However, \"cryptocurrency\" has also become a blanket term used to refer to any token that has an exchange or market value. Examples of cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Solana, and Cardano. Cryptocurrencies are also called crypto coins, coins, tokens, and virtual currencies. As cryptocurrencies and blockchains continue to evolve, definitions change as more people become familiar with the concepts and terms used. There is some debate as to what constitutes crypto commodities, but in general, there are two definitions in use: The CFTC's definition is clearly stated: The commission believes all virtual currencies and their derivatives are commodities and fall under its jurisdiction. By the second definition, a crypto commodity can be anything that has its value transferred to a token, which is called tokenization. For example, oil is considered a commodity in the physical world. There is a certain cost associated with extracting it from the earth, and it is used to power the global economy. If one barrel of oil were represented on a blockchain by one token, that token would become a crypto commodity. For investors, it's important to distinguish between these different types of tokens because the terms are loosely applied by many people, which can cause confusion for those just starting out. \"Crypto tokens\" is a blanket term that encompasses all blockchain tokens. But depending on who you're talking to, they could be referring to a cryptocurrency\u2014they might just be using a different term. Cryptocurrencies are usually valued based on market traction, supply schedules, network difficulty levels, and speculation about their future. Crypto commodities, as defined by the CFTC, should follow market prices because they are either virtual currencies or derivatives. According to the second general definition of crypto commodities, the tokens should be valued based on the prices of the underlying assets. \"Crypto token\" is a blanket term or category that includes all assets issued on a blockchain, such as cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens, or security tokens. Cryptocurrency might be a good investment for someone who enjoys speculating and can tolerate the risks inherent to crypto investing. If you're searching for a way to build wealth, a nest egg, or save for retirement, cryptocurrency might not be a good option. Ethereum is a blockchain designed to function as a worldwide virtual computer for building applications. Its native token, ether, is considered a commodity by the CFTC because it is a virtual currency. While they are sometimes used interchangeably, the terms \"cryptocurrency\" and \"crypto commodity\" refer to subcategories of crypto tokens, which are tokens created using a blockchain. How they are valued by investors and speculators should depend on how they are traded and used and how popular they are in the market.

She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained immense popularity\u00a0thanks to their decentralized, secure, and nearly anonymous nature. These characteristics support their peer-to-peer architectures and make it possible to transfer\u00a0funds and other digital assets between two different individuals without a central authority. How does this automated and pseudonymous system of cryptocurrency ensure\u00a0that all transactions are processed with due diligence and authenticity without any intervention? Enter the underlying concept and tools of cryptography, which form the backbone of cryptocurrency blockchains. The word \u201ccrypto\u201d literally means concealed or secret. \"Cryptography\" means \"secret writing\"\u2014the ability to exchange messages that can only be read by the intended recipient. Depending upon the configuration, cryptographic techniques can ensure pseudo or full anonymity. In cryptocurrency, cryptography is used for multiple purposes\u2014to secure the various transactions occurring on the network, control new currency unit generation, and verify digital asset and token transfers. In the simplest terms, cryptography is a mathematical technique that hides information. Several techniques are used to convert data from plain text to cyphered text. To encrypt data, an encryption key is required. This is one of the most fundamental aspects of cryptography. This key is generally an algorithm\u2014or formula\u2014that encrypts and decrypts information. These keys make a message, transaction, or data value unreadable to an unauthorized reader or recipient. Only someone with the correct key can access the data. In Bitcoin's case, the information from a block is sent through an algorithm, resulting in a 64-digit hexadecimal number. No matter how many characters are in the data, it always results in 64 digits. Some of the more common encryption algorithms are: Bitcoin uses the elliptic curve cryptography method called secp256k1, where the formula y2 = x3 + 7 (over the real numbers) results in an elliptic curve on a graph. This method is used to generate public and private key pairs. Bitcoin also uses the Secure Hashing Algorithm 256 (SHA256) to encrypt the data stored in blocks. Hashing has multiple functions on blockchains, including efficiently verifying the integrity of transactions on the network and maintaining the structure of the blockchain. It encodes people\u2019s account addresses, is an integral part of the process of encrypting transactions that occur between accounts, and, on the Bitcoin blockchain, is used for validating transactions (mining). There are generally two types of cryptographic methods used to generate keys, asymmetric and symmetric. Asymmetric Encryption Cryptography uses two different keys\u2014public and private\u2014to encrypt and decrypt data. The public key can be disseminated openly, like the address of the fund receiver, while the private key\u00a0is known only to the owner. In this method, a person can encrypt a message using the receiver's public key, but it can be decrypted only by the receiver's private key. This method helps achieve the two important authentication and encryption functions for cryptocurrency transactions. The former is achieved as the public key verifies the paired private key for the genuine sender of the message, while the latter is accomplished as only the paired private key holder can successfully decrypt the encrypted message. Most cryptocurrencies use the public and private keys created by asymmetric cryptographic methods. Symmetric Encryption Cryptography uses the same secret key to encrypt the raw message at the source, transmit the encrypted message to the recipient, and then decrypt the message at the destination. A simple example is representing alphabets with numbers\u2014say, \"A\" is 01, \"B\" is 02, and so on. A message like \"HELLO\" would be encrypted as \"0805121215,\" and this value will be transmitted over the network to the recipient(s). Once received, the recipient will decrypt it using the same reverse methodology\u2014\"08\" is H, \"05\" is E, and so on, to get the original message value \"HELLO.\" Even if unauthorized parties receive the encrypted message \"0805121215,\" it will be of no value to them unless they know the encryption methodology. \"Crypto\" refers to cryptographic techniques used and to the anonymity cryptocurrency was once thought to provide. \"Crypto,\" or rather the Latinized form of the Greek word \"kryptos,\" means hidden, secret, or covered. It has been used for centuries as a combining form word to describe secret or hidden things. Most recently, it has been combined with the word \"currency\" to refer to the cryptography used in blockchains and their tokens. Shortly after Bitcoin was introduced, every blockchain-related token that emerged was considered a cryptocurrency. However, many entities define a cryptocurrency differently, and there is little consensus on what is and isn't a cryptocurrency. In general, cryptocurrencies use cryptographic techniques to secure information on a blockchain and issue a token that can be exchanged for money or another token. Anonymity and concealment are key aspects of cryptocurrencies, and various cryptographic techniques ensure that participants and their activities remain hidden to the desired extent on the network.

            "title": "How Cryptocurrencies Impact Estate Planning",
            "content": "Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. Estate planning for investment portfolios has always been somewhat complicated, but in the era of digital currencies, it has gotten significantly more so. It used to be that investors could write out a will and include items like stock certificates in a safe deposit box for their next of kin and that the transfer of investments would move smoothly. Now, there are new laws and protocols which must be observed if an investor wants to be sure that his or her digital assets are safely and securely transferred when the time comes. Below, we'll explore some of the ins and outs of estate planning when it comes to digital assets. In some cases, the rules haven't changed. In others, there are new considerations to keep in mind that traditional investors may not yet be aware of. Perhaps the single most important consideration when estate planning with cryptocurrencies is ensuring that the executor of your estate knows which assets you hold and how you can access them. A recent report by Forbes suggests that the accessing of these assets can be the most difficult component in the entire process. Cryptocurrency investors are notoriously fickle about how they store their digital keys and access codes. This is unsurprising, as these passwords allow for full access to digital wallets. On the other hand, be too tricky about things and you run the risk of losing the code. If this happens, there is often no way to recover access, and a wallet full of cryptocurrency tokens can go permanently unused. Cryptoasset inheritance planning expert Pam Morgan recommends an old-fashioned method: \"I'm a big fan of paper and pen\" for listing cryptocurrency keys for executors and heirs. Morgan adds that \"it's most important to explain [to them] the kinds of assets, key locations, and access controls you're using for security. Access controls are things like PINs, passphrases, multisignature or timelock requirements.\" Even with a clear explanation of where your digital assets are and how your heirs can access them, though, you may be setting your next of kin up for legal trouble if you don't take deliberate action. Ideally, investors will consider both the technical accessibility as well as the legal ramifications. Without considering the legal issues associated with estate planning, investors could be setting up their heirs for lengthy lawsuits. On the other hand, Morgan acknowledges, \"without [crypto] keys, a court order is impotent.\" Morgan recommends making at least two copies of records of assets and storing them in separate locations. These lists may be worth updating as often as once per week, particularly for highly active cryptocurrency investors. On the other hand, Chicago attorney Michael Goldberg, another expert on cryptocurrency estate planning, suggests that traders who are only active infrequently can probably get away with fewer lists of assets. \"I have a pretty wide variety [of tokens],\" he explains, adding that he recommends creating and updating a list once per year. From a legal perspective, the majority of states have enacted laws in recent years allowing executors to manage digital assets in a similar way to how they might manage traditional assets. This could help as executors feel the urge to sell off cryptocurrency assets quickly; this can prevent them from feeling the backlash from heirs if the virtual currencies drop in value in the meantime. Still, while the law is hurrying to catch up with crypto estate planning, there is room to grow nonetheless. National College of Probate Judges President Tamara Curry suggests that jurists will have to become better versed in cryptocurrencies. \"Courts are going to become more inundated. Judges are going to have to be educated and made aware of what to look for when these assets come before them,\" Curry stated."

            "title": "How Do Cryptocurrency Mining Pools Work?",
            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications. A mining pool is a group of miners who work together to solve the cryptographic problems required by certain blockchains which reward the miners with cryptocurrency. Pools were created when cryptocurrency mining reached a difficulty level that only miners with enormous capacity could accomplish. This crowded small miners out of the competitive mining process, forcing them to work together to compete with the large mining firms. Cryptocurrency mining involves two functions\u2014releasing new cryptocurrency into the system and verifying and adding transactions to the blockchain. It is performed using internet-connected devices\u00a0and software programs which perform the mining process. Crypto mining is\u00a0a calculation-intensive, puzzle-solving-like computation process that requires\u00a0high processing power and electricity consumption. The miner(s) who first solves the puzzle gets to place the next block on the blockchain and claim the rewards.\u00a0Mining rewards include newly released Bitcoin and fees for the work done. All transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain are paid for by the user to whoever solves the problem. The cryptocurrency discovery process is configured so that if more miners are working, the difficulty level goes up. A decline in the number of miners eases the difficulty level. The rewards make mining a lucrative activity for monetary gains. As more miners attempt to grab a piece of the pie, finding new blocks becomes computationally more difficult, requiring more computing power. This\u00a0is often impractical and too expensive for individual miners who can't afford multiple mining-specific machines. Enter the mining pool, a collection or group of miners working together to increase their\u00a0chances of finding a block at the group level compared to that at the individual level. Through these pools, miners combine their individual computational resources with those of the other members. This enhances their joint processing power and helps them become more competitive, increasing their chances of receiving a reward. To draw an analogy, imagine a gold digger has the capacity to dig 100 square meters of land in one day. It would take them 100 days to explore one hectare of land for gold. Combining 100 gold diggers with the same capacity can complete the job in just one day. Any gold discovered can be split among all 100 diggers evenly, assuming all have put in equal effort to explore their assigned portions of land. Similarly, one can combine nine mining devices, each generating mining power of 335 megahashes per second (MH/s), to generate a combined output of around three gigahashes. The output is faster and has an increased chance to solve the puzzle. It's important to understand the scale at which the Bitcoin network mines. On March 14, 2024, the Bitcoin network mined at a rate of about 635 exahashes per second (quintillion). One of the mining pools consistently in the top few pools by hashrate is FoundryDigital, which had a total Bitcoin hash rate of about 171 exahashes on March 14, 2024. However, this pooling, with better output and higher chances, comes at a cost. The reward earned through combined mining is split among the various pool members, as compared to sole ownership of the reward earned through individual mining. A mining pool essentially works as a coordinator for the pool members. The functions involve assigning work, looking for rewards through pooled efforts of available processing power, recording work performed by each pool member, and\u00a0assigning reward shares to each pool member in proportion to the work performed after suitable verification. The pool may also charge a fee from each member miner. Work to each pool member can be assigned in two ways. The traditional method involves assigning members a work unit comprised\u00a0of a particular range of nonce. This is a number that blockchain miners use to add to the block's hash to generate a hexadecimal number to compare to the network target. Once the pool member completes the work on the assigned range, they place a request for a new work unit to be assigned. A second mining method allows pool members the liberty to pick and choose as much work as they like without any assignment coming from the pool. The methodology ensures that no two members take the same range, just like no two gold diggers should explore\u00a0the same piece of land. Successful identification of the block hash leads to reward for the pool, which is usually based on a shares mechanism. Shares describe how much work a particular member contributes to the mining pool. There are two kinds of shares\u2014accepted and rejected. Accepted shares indicate that work done by a pool member contributes substantially towards discovering new cryptocurrency, and these get rewarded. Rejected shares represent work that does not contribute to a\u00a0blockchain\u00a0discovery. Many pools generally do not pay for these. Even if a member\u2019s computer performs work successfully but submits it late for that particular block, it constitutes rejected work. A pool member ideally wants all their shares to be accepted. However, rejected shares are inevitable, as it is impossible for all the computations on a member\u2019s computer to be useful in coin discovery and always be submitted on time. Pool members are rewarded based on their accepted shares that helped open a block. A share has no actual value and simply acts as an accounting method to keep the reward distribution fair. Based on the accepted shares, members get rewarded using different methods, some of which include the following: Other variations include the Double Geometric Method (DGM), Recent Shared Maximum Pay Per Share (RSMPPS), Capped Pay Per Share with Recent Backpay (CPPSRB), and Bitcoin Pooled Mining (BPM). Before deciding to join a particular pool, miners should pay attention to how each pool shares its payments among members and what fees, if any, it charges. Typically, pools may charge between 1% and 3% as pool fees. A mining pool is a group of cryptocurrency miners that combine their resources and attempt to solve the cryptographic mining puzzle. Pool members can receive shares of any rewards, and the mining pool managers might receive fees for providing and administering the pool. If you can't afford several top-of-the-line mining machines but still want to mine a cryptocurrency, joining a mining pool is the only option. It is worth it if you have a machine capable of producing a significant amount of work for the pool. If you're looking for a way to recoup the expenses of purchasing mining equipment, whether it's worth it depends on your contributions to the pool and how much you get back. With mining becoming more centralized toward large firms with thousands of high-speed mining devices, the chances of realistically profiting\u00a0from individual mining are diminishing. Most individuals opt to join\u00a0a mining pool, which allows them a high probability of limited profits instead of a low probability of high profits. Most people will not be able to earn a significant profit from mining in its current state. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

            "title": "What's the Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency?",
            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Cryptocurrency is a virtual currency touted as a way to remove all of the costs incurred between money users and suppliers and put its control into the hands of the people. But cryptocurrency requires energy, equipment, internet, and a global networking infrastructure to be useful. Thus, it has a large environmental impact, with some networks using as much energy as small countries to maintain a blockchain. There are even concerns about cryptocurrency's water and waste footprints. Keep reading to learn more about cryptocurrency's impact on the environment. There is no direct way to calculate how much energy is used for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining, but the figure can be estimated from the network's hashrate and the consumption by commercially-available mining rigs. For example, the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption (CBEC) Index estimates that Bitcoin, the most widely-mined cryptocurrency network, uses an estimated 151 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually (0.59% of global electricity use)\u2014more than Ukraine, using the latest country energy estimates from 2022. Another estimate by Digiconomist, a cryptocurrency analytics site, placed the figure at about 98 terawatt-hours. This computed to around 435.61 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction, the same amount of power consumed by the average American household over 15 days. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency network, was estimated by CBEC to use about 5.52 gigawatt-hours, and Digiconomist states the blockchain uses about 0.85 watt-hours per transaction. Thousands of different cryptocurrencies and hundreds of exchanges exist worldwide. None of the cryptocurrency energy use reports or calculations account for the energy expended to develop new coins or administer services for them. The amount of energy consumed by cryptocurrency mining will likely vary over time, assuming that prices and user adoption continue to change. Cryptocurrency mining is a competitive process: as the value of the block reward increases, the incentives to start mining also increase. Higher cryptocurrency prices mean more energy consumed by crypto networks because more people join the mining networks trying to profit from the increases. The energy intensity of crypto mining is a feature, not a bug. Bitcoin mining is the automated process of validating Bitcoin transactions without the intervention of trusted third parties like banks. The way the transaction validation process is designed uses large amounts of energy\u2014the network depends on the computational power of thousands of computers. This dependency maintains the security of cryptocurrency blockchains that use proof-of-work consensus. It's important to point out that not all cryptocurrencies use a system that depends on large amounts of energy to run. Ethereum, Solana, and many others use a system that requires very little energy\u2014their environmental impact adds little to the impact already created by the global networking infrastructure and its daily use. Calculating the carbon footprint of cryptocurrency is more complicated. Although fossil fuels are the predominant energy source in most countries where cryptocurrency is mined, miners must seek out the most inexpensive energy sources to remain profitable. Digiconomist estimates that the Bitcoin network is responsible for about 55 million tons of carbon dioxide per year\u2014equal to the amount generated by Singapore. Ethereum produced an estimated 35.4 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions before dropping to minimal amounts following its transition to proof of stake. Greed and a fear of missing out on the latest gold rush drive Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies to use so much energy\u2014these blockchains automatically adjust the mining difficulty according to how powerful the networks are. In other words, the less computing power the network has, the lower the mining difficulty is and the less energy it uses per transaction. But because there is a reward for the most and fastest computing power, those who can afford to have flooded the network with energy-hungry machines networked in a way that gives them the upper hand in receiving rewards. This attracts other participants, and the group grows in size and energy use\u2014all because the financial returns can exceed the initial costs. The environmental impacts are always an afterthought when profits and return on investment are involved. Researchers at the University of Cambridge report that most Bitcoin mining occurs in the U.S. (38%), China (21%), and Kazakhstan (12%). According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, about 77% of the energy consumed in China is generated from coal and crude oil. The U.S. gets two-thirds of its electricity by burning fossil fuels, per 2022 data from the EIA. Kazakhstan mainly uses fossil fuels. As a result, three countries heavily dependent on fossil fuels are responsible for around 71% of the world's Bitcoin mining. Cryptocurrency mining also generates significant electronic waste, as mining hardware quickly becomes obsolete. This is especially true for Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners, which are specialized machines designed for mining the most popular cryptocurrencies. According to Digiconomist, the Bitcoin network generated about 10.52 kilotons (annualized) as of August 2024. Due to the heat generated by mining machines, miners, manufacturers, and maintainers have turned to water cooling to reduce the costs of keeping equipment cool. In some cases, large mining farms have discharged hot or warm water into lakes or other water bodies, raising concerns about raising the average temperature of or contaminating these bodies with a continuous discharge. The results of these practices are unknown, as not enough research has yet been completed to learn how much water is consumed (made unusable) or contaminated. Large-scale cryptocurrency miners are often located where energy is abundant, reliable, and cheap. But, processing cryptocurrency transactions and minting new coins does not need to be energy-intensive. Bitcoin could be adjusted to use a non-competitive block proposing and verification mechanism. The proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism is an alternative to cryptocurrency mining that does not use extensive computing power. The authority to validate transactions and operate the crypto network is instead granted based on the amount of cryptocurrency a validator has \"staked\" or put up as collateral for honest behavior and the privilege of earning fees. Other methods of validation, such as proof of history, proof of elapsed time, proof of burn, and proof of capacity, are also being developed. While Ethereum's developers have the blockchain's old proof-of-work mechanism\u2014with estimates of a 99.9% reduction in carbon emissions\u2014there is no such objective in the Bitcoin community. Since Bitcoin is the most popular crypto, it means that mining, along with its enormous energy costs, is likely here to stay as long as it remains profitable. Some cryptocurrencies have intense energy requirements and special equipment needs, generating lots of waste. In that sense, some are not environmentally friendly. However, it's important to remember that the environmental costs of making and maintaining fiat currency and our current banking system are also energy intensive. There are some cryptocurrency and blockchain projects that advertise environmental, social, and governance best practices, but they are not as popular because they are considered to have less earning potential than the more popular cryptocurrencies. The most significant concern is that some blockchains consume too much energy, produce extra greenhouse gases unnecessarily, and create more e-waste. Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrency networks use large amounts of energy and create extra electronic waste. Proponents say it is justified because these virtual currencies bring financial systems to millions of people who do not have access to loans, banking, or other services. Some opponents say it is a waste of energy because cryptocurrency has no value. Others argue that crypto only fills the pockets of those who can afford expensive mining equipment and high market values, notably businesses and the already wealthy. Regardless of the opinions of fans and skeptics, cryptocurrency has an environmental impact. It consumes energy primarily generated by fossil fuels. At a time when the world is in dire need of reducing its carbon footprint, the last thing anyone needs is another source of money-making at the expense of the planet and its inhabitants.

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Proof-of-stake is a blockchain consensus mechanism for processing transactions and creating new blocks. A consensus mechanism is a method for validating entries into a distributed database and keeping the database secure. In the case of cryptocurrency, the database is called a blockchain\u2014so the consensus mechanism secures the blockchain. Learn more about proof-of-stake and how it is different from proof-of-work. Additionally, find out the issues proof-of-stake attempts to address within the cryptocurrency industry. Investopedia / Crea Taylor Proof-of-stake reduces the computational work needed to verify blocks and transactions. Under proof-of-work, hefty computing requirements kept the blockchain secure. Proof-of-stake changes the way blocks are verified using the machines of coin owners, so there doesn't need to be as much computational work done. The owners offer their coins as collateral\u2014called staking\u2014for the chance to validate blocks and earn rewards. Validators are selected randomly to confirm transactions and validate block information. This system randomizes who gets to collect fees rather than using a competitive rewards-based mechanism like proof-of-work. To become a validator, a coin owner must \"stake\" a specific amount of coins. For instance, Ethereum requires 32 ETH to be staked before a user can operate a node. Blocks are validated by multiple validators, and when a specific number of validators verify that the block is accurate, it is finalized and closed. To activate your own validator, you'll need to stake 32 ETH; however, you don't need to stake that much ETH to participate in validation. You can join validation pools using \"liquid staking\" which uses an ERC-20 token that represents your ETH. Different proof-of-stake mechanisms may use various methods to reach a consensus. For example, when Ethereum introduces sharding, a validator will verify the transactions and add them to a shard block, which requires no more than 128 validators to form a voting \"committee.\" Once shards are validated and a block created, two-thirds of the validators must agree that the transaction is valid, then the block is closed. Both consensus mechanisms help blockchains synchronize data, validate information, and process transactions. Each method has proven successful at maintaining a blockchain, although each has pros and cons. However, the two algorithms have very different approaches. Under PoS, block creators are called validators. A validator checks transactions, verifies activity, votes on outcomes, and maintains records. Under PoW, block creators are called miners. Miners work to solve a hashing problem to verify transactions. In return for solving it, they are rewarded with a coin. To \"buy into\" the position of becoming a block creator, you need to own enough coins or tokens to become a validator on a PoS blockchain. For PoW, miners must invest in processing equipment and incur hefty energy charges to power the machines attempting to solve the computations. The equipment and energy costs under PoW mechanisms are expensive, limiting access to mining and strengthening the security of the blockchain. PoS blockchains reduce the amount of processing power needed to validate block information and transactions. The mechanism also lowers network congestion and removes the rewards-based incentive PoW blockchains have. Proof-of-stake is designed to reduce network congestion and address environmental sustainability concerns surrounding the proof-of-work (PoW) protocol. Proof-of-work is a competitive approach to verifying transactions, which naturally encourages people to look for ways to gain an advantage, especially since monetary value is involved. Bitcoin miners earn bitcoin by verifying transactions and blocks. However, they pay their operating expenses, such as electricity and rent, with fiat currency. So what's really happening is that miners exchange energy for cryptocurrency, which causes PoW mining to use as much energy as some small countries. The PoS mechanism seeks to solve these problems by effectively substituting staking for computational power, whereby the network randomizes an individual's mining ability. This means there should be a drastic reduction in energy consumption since miners can no longer rely on massive farms of single-purpose hardware to gain an advantage. For example, Ethereum's transition from PoW to PoS reduced the blockchain's energy consumption by 99.84%. The first cryptocurrency to adopt the PoS method was Peercoin. Several others followed soon after, but Ethereum was the blockchain where it made the biggest impact. Long touted as a threat to cryptocurrency fans, the 51% attack is a concern when PoS is used, but it is doubtful it will occur. Under PoW, a 51% attack occurs when an entity controls more than 50% of the miners in a network and uses that majority to alter the blockchain. In PoS, a group or individual would have to own 51% of the staked cryptocurrency. It's very expensive to control 51% of staked cryptocurrency. Under Ethereum's PoS, if a 51% attack occurred, the honest validators in the network could vote to disregard the altered blockchain and burn the offender(s) staked ETH. This incentivizes validators to act in good faith to benefit the cryptocurrency and the network. Most other security features of PoS are not advertised, as this might create an opportunity to circumvent security measures. However, most PoS systems have extra security features in place that add to the inherent security behind blockchains and PoS mechanisms. Proof-of-Stake (POS) uses randomly selected validators to confirm transactions and create new blocks. Proof-of-Work (POW) uses a competitive validation method to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. Proof-of-Stake is a consensus mechanism where distributed cryptocurrency validator programs share the task of validating transactions. Under Proof of Stake (POS) consensus, users must generally own a cryptocurrency before they can participate in consensus and earn more crypto. To host a full validator node on Ethereum, a user needs to stake 32 ETH, which is very expensive. Another disadvantage of PoS is that on blockchains with smaller networks, a large minimum stake could lead to centralization. Ethereum uses proof-of-stake as its consensus mechanic. Full validator nodes require a stake of 32 ETH, but other participants can take part in consensus by delegating their ETH to a validator or participating in staking pools. Users can also stake small amounts of ETH on their own, but no rewards are earned. Proof-of-stake is a mechanism used to verify blockchain transactions. It differs from proof-of-work significantly, mainly in the fact that it incentivizes honest behavior by rewarding those who put their crypto up as collateral for a chance to earn more.

HODL is a term derived from a misspelling of \"hold\" in the context of\u00a0buying and holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It's also commonly come to stand for \"hold on for dear life\" among crypto investors. The term originated from a 2013 online\u00a0post to the Bitcointalk forum where the typo appeared. The price of Bitcoin in 2013 was volatile at the time, surging to over $950 at the beginning of December 2013, up from just over $130 in April of the same year.

HODL, as an acronym for \"hold on for dear life,\" has become a mantra among crypto enthusiasts denoting a long-term approach to cryptocurrency investing. This approach mirrors GameKyuubi's rationale in the original post that novice traders are likely to botch their attempts to time the market, and should simply hold their coin. For cryptocurrency maximalists, HODL represents more than a strategy for reigning in FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt), and other profit-eroding emotions. Long-term crypto HODLers stay invested\u00a0because they believe: Predictably,\u00a0a meme best captures\u00a0this HODL\u00a0maximalist\u00a0philosophy. Neo from The Matrix asks Morpheus, \"What are you trying to tell me, that I can trade my Bitcoin for millions someday?\" Morpheus responds, \"No Neo, I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready \u2026 you won't have to.\" Based on these principles, the best time to HODL is now, always, and forever. A true believer would always hold on to their tokens, even if markets crash or become extremely volatile. HODLing becomes an ideological belief about the long-term prospects of blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and the communities that have formed around them. The VanEck Bitcoin Trust, formed in January 2024, uses the ticker \"HODL.\" The crypto community has adopted several acronyms and terms (often with accompanying emojis) in addition to HODLing. Many of these also overlap with terms used in meme stock communities and forums. Some of these include: While HODLing is generally associated with cryptocurrency investors, the buy-and-hold investing strategy that it represents is not limited to crypto investing. Many stock investors \"HODL\" their investments for long periods of time, although stock prices are almost always less volatile than the prices of crypto assets. Investors in stocks who buy and hold can benefit from long-term price appreciation while experiencing much less price volatility than is associated with cryptocurrencies. HODL may also refer to a DeFI token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). HODL Coin (HODL/$HODL) was launched in May 2021. Much like the term itself, HODL encourages users to hold onto their tokens for rewards in the Binance coin (BNB) that are distributed every three days. The rewards are generated from taxes collected on transactions made by users, such as sale, purchase, or transfer of HODL tokens. The tax amount is converted into BNB tokens, and a percentage of the gains are redistributed to users from the collective liquidity pool. \"HODL\" originated as a misspelling of \"HOLD\" (written in all caps), in an online post by an early Bitcoin investor. But \"HODL\", as it has gained popularity among crypto enthusiasts, has come to mean \"hold on for dear life\". Crypto HODLers, like buy-and-hold stock investors, pride themselves on \"holding on\" by not selling their cryptocurrency, no matter what happens in the crypto markets. The true identity is unknown of the person who inadvertently coined the term \"HODL\". The original misspelling of the word occurred in a post by the user \"GameKyuubi\" on the Bitcointalk.org online forum, at 10:03 a.m. UTC on Dec. 18, 2013. HODL was a typo in a forum post title that quickly caught as a term that means hold on in the early cryptocurrency community. HODL is used in the crypto community to refer to a strategy of holding onto bitcoin holdings through its various price fluctuations and volatility. The acronym is a misspelling of the word \"holding\" by a user on an online forum. Typically used by Bitcoin maximalists, a HODLing strategy is similar to the conventional buy-and-hold investing strategy. HODL is also the name and symbol of a token on cryptocurrency exchange Binance's Smart Chain. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

            "title": "What Is Cryptocurrency Cold Storage and Which Method Is Safest?",
            "content": "Cold storage is removing your cryptocurrency keys from your wallet and storing them somewhere that is not connected to another device, a network, or the internet. Additionally, electronic cold storage methods shouldn't have the ability to communicate with any other electronic device unless it is physically connected to that device when you're accessing your keys. Cold storage became a concern early on in cryptocurrency's development because of concerns over key theft by hackers. Originally, it consisted of writing down the keys on a piece of paper and removing them from the wallet. Cold storage has since evolved because it is more popular and users demanded easier and more secure methods. It's important to explore the concept of a cryptocurrency wallet to understand storage. For cryptocurrency users, wallets function somewhat similarly to physical wallets, which hold cash. However, these wallets hold cryptocurrency keys. They are digital storage tools that have both a public and private key. The public key is similar to an email address because it is used as the address used to send and receive crypto. The private key is used to access the cryptocurrency. These keys are strings of characters necessary to complete cryptocurrency transfers to or from a wallet. For safety, you can store the keys somewhere other than your wallet. If the storage medium is connected to a device that is connected to the internet, it is referred to as hot; cold storage does not have a connection or is not connected to a device that is online. The most commonly used cold storage methods are hardware wallets. However, the number of cold storage techniques is limited only by the user's imagination. Some are more obscure, while others can be ultra-secure. Here are a few types that are or have been used. Paper wallets involve printing or writing your private keys on paper and storing them somewhere. Another technique used in the past was adding a QR code that can be scanned to make transactions faster, but this reduces security because you have to use a device with a camera, both of which could be compromised. A paper wallet with a QR code contains all the information needed to spend the coins, so its safety is crucially important. Paper wallets can be misplaced, the ink can fade, or you could accidentally leave one on your desk and spill coffee on it. If you choose this method, be sure to have a safe box or other secure storage method to place your wallet in. If you choose to use paper wallets, use a type of paper designed for longevity, such as archival paper or bond paper. Hardware wallets are storage devices that might look like USB drives or smart devices that can be plugged into or connected wirelessly to the device you use to access your wallet. They are one of the more safe and secure ways of placing your keys in cold storage. You can use anything from a standard USB storage drive to an advanced device with a battery, Bluetooth, software, and other features. Air-gapped devices have no connection ability and are more secure than ones that can connect wirelessly. You can buy commercial hardware wallets from retailers and merchants; many are water and virus proof\u2014some even support multi-signature (multi-sig) transactions. Multi-sig is a cryptocurrency signature method that requires more than one user to approve a transaction using private keys. Many advanced hardware storage devices are available, but it's important to remember that the more convenient a storage method is, the less secure it is. The fewer features a method has, the more secure it is. Sound wallets are an obscure and expensive way to store your keys, depending on your chosen medium. Sound wallets involve encrypting and recording your private keys in sound files on products such as Compact Discs (CDs) or vinyl disks (records). The code hidden in these audio files can be deciphered using a spectroscope application or high-resolution spectroscope. Sound wallets were an early attempt at storing keys securely and are rarely used, if ever. Placing your cold storage hardware wallet in your safe is secure, but it isn't considered deep cold storage because it is easy to access. Deep cold storage is any method that is very inconvenient and requires time and effort to retrieve your keys. This could be anything from placing your hardware wallet in a waterproof container and burying it six feet down in your garden to using a third-party service that stores your cryptocurrency keys in a vault that requires multiple steps to access. Burying your keys deep in the garden has several drawbacks, like lots of digging and remembering where you buried it, but so does the ultra-secure vault service. Vault services generally require your identity, proof of address, or other means of identification. Additionally, it can take hours or days to access your keys, depending on where they are stored, the measures taken to store them, and the procedures used by the custodian. Most cryptocurrency exchanges offer cold storage for their user's keys that is very secure. This deep cold storage is similar to enterprise-level data storage used by businesses and governments. However, there are risks to using third-party storage options like this, as exchanges are a favorite target for thieves. There is some measure of comfort to be had when using this method, as a few exchanges insure the assets you have in their storage. If you prefer to have a business hold your keys for you, make sure it insures your crypto assets so you're protected if your keys are stolen while under its care. Cold storage removes your private keys from your connected wallet, which is a good practice. If your keys cannot be accessed, they cannot be stolen. It depends on how you choose to store them. A hardware wallet from a popular provider might cost $50, $200, or more, but storing your crypto keys in your exchange's cold storage might be free. If a court order requires cryptocurrency to be seized and the proper warrants are issued, a business holding your keys in custody must turn them over (send them to a government address). If you custody the keys yourself, you'll be required to turn your assets over to the appointed officials, either by transferring the keys to a government address or giving them the medium you have them stored on. Cold storage is transferring your private cryptocurrency keys to a non-connected medium. The medium could be paper, a USB thumb drive, a commercially designed USB device, or any other method you can think of that stores your keys. It's important to remember that it's the connection that makes a storage device hot or cold. When you're choosing a storage device, make sure you do your research and store your devices somewhere they cannot be damaged."

            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Delmaine Donson / Getty Images Privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies are digital currencies with features that enhance privacy and anonymity. Many people are concerned about how governments and enterprises use their personal information and data, so they naturally want less scrutiny of their private lives. However, many privacy-oriented tokens have been removed from popular exchanges due to governmental and law enforcement concerns in many jurisdictions. Decentralized (DEX) and unregulated exchanges and self-hosted wallets are thus slowly becoming the only means for acquiring or using privacy cryptocurrencies. Here's a rundown of the top five most popular privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies, which have several built-in privacy features. These projects claim to offer enhanced security features or options that help to keep users' identities and activities concealed. Regulators in many jurisdictions have put privacy tokens and privacy-enhancing techniques on notice because they are all too often used for illegal activities. In the U.S., cryptocurrency mixing service providers have been arrested, and their services shut down. The European Parliament finalized a regulation in April 2024, setting the stage for a ban on hosted privacy-oriented tokens and techniques and tightening regulations for crypto-service providers. In most cases, users are still allowed to self-custody these assets and use them in peer-to-peer transactions. Monero (XMR) is a cryptocurrency designed primarily for the ability to help anonymize users. Monero transactions are much more difficult to trace because they use ring signatures and stealth addresses. These methods help to hide the identities of the sender and the receiver. Additionally, Ring Confidential Transactions, or RingCT, helps to conceal the transaction amount, providing more privacy. Trading at $129.23 as of May 5, 2024, Monero was #48 by overall market value, coming in at roughly $2.4 billion. Zcash (ZEC) defines itself as \"If Bitcoin is like http for money, Zcash is https,\" underlining its enhanced security and privacy features. Zcash has implemented a cryptographic tool called Zero-Knowledge proof and grants participants an option to shield transactions. It allows participants to transact without any of them revealing their addresses to the other(s). Zero-Knowledge proofs also hide transaction amounts. Zcash ranked #171 in the list of cryptocurrencies with a market cap of $378 million and traded at $23.19 on May 5, 2024. Created in 2014, DASH is a cryptocurrency that allows users to choose whether or not their transactions are anonymous and private using a protocol known as CoinJoin. The feature works by obscuring the origins of your funds. Choosing to use the feature will slightly raise the transaction fee. DASH achieves this through a mixing protocol utilizing an innovative decentralized network of servers called master nodes. Another feature DASH offers is Instant Send, which can process transactions as fast as a credit card. On May 5, 2024, Dash ranked #186 by market cap with a total value of $347 million. At the time of writing, it traded at about $29.47. Cryptocurrency tumblers and mixers are increasingly used for money laundering and other illicit activities. Law enforcement and regulators in many jurisdictions are targeting these service providers as facilitators, so it's best to use caution and learn the rules in your country when considering a cryptocurrency or service that uses mixing techniques. A controversial cryptocurrency tumbler, 0x0.ai is a cryptocurrency and digital asset platform that allows users to anonymize their transactions and identities by pooling transactions. These transactions are then mixed, and cryptocurrency is distributed to other users. On May 5, 2024, 0x0 traded at $0.36 and ranked #231 by market cap, with a total value of $313 million. MimbleWimble is a privacy-focused token with core features that allow complete control over your privacy. All transaction amounts are encrypted by default, and no addresses or other private information are stored on the blockchain. On the MimbleWimble blockchain, transactions appear as random inputs and outputs. Between the encryption, lack of addresses, and built-in randomness, there is no way to track users. On May 5, 2024, MWC was #305 by market cap, with $182.5 million, and tokens traded at $16.66. Monero is the most popular privacy crypto, followed by ZCash and Dash. Each appeals to different users. A privacy cryptocurrency uses techniques to provide users with more anonymity and privacy. Privacy coins are being targeted in many jurisdictions because they can be used for nefarious purposes. Exchanges who rely on regulatory compliance are beginning to remove them, but decentralized exchanges that don't fall under any jurisdictions still list them. Privacy coins are likely not going anywhere as the people that want them will find ways to use them. Privacy tokens have a place in the world, as privacy is something many people long for. These cryptocurrencies promise a life away from government and enterprise snooping that many people desire. However, privacy for average law-abiding citizens means more privacy for criminals, so it's difficult to say whether privacy cryptocurrencies will be available in the future.

            "title": "Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): Definition, Purpose, and Example",
            "content": "Pete Rathburn is a copy editor and fact-checker with expertise in economics and personal finance and over twenty years of experience in the classroom. A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an emerging form of organizational structure with no central governing body and whose members share a common goal of acting in the best interest of the entity. Popularized by blockchain enthusiasts, DAOs make decisions using a bottom-up management approach. One of the major features of digital currencies is that they are decentralized. This means they are not controlled by a single institution like a government or central bank but instead are divided among a variety of computers, networks, and nodes. Inspired by the decentralization of cryptocurrencies, a group of developers came up with the idea for a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, in 2016. The concept of a DAO is to promote oversight and management of an entity similar to a corporation. However, the key to a DAO is the lack of central authority; the collective group of leaders and participants acts as the governing body. DAOs rely heavily on smart contracts to function. These scripts generally automate the group's decisions when the required number of votes is reached. If the group votes on a proposal and it fails, the smart contract doesn't execute anything. For example, imagine a cryptocurrency was governed by a DAO. A faction of members wanted to change how a blockchain's tokenomics worked. This could be an increase in the circulating supply of coins, burning a select amount of reserve tokens, or issuing rewards to existing token holders. Members could create a proposal and call for a vote, which would be broadcast to all members with voting rights. They could vote, and the smart contract would tally the vote. This type of change might or might not be automated, as it would require altering the blockchain's coding. Regardless, the outcome of the vote would determine the direction the blockchain would take. If the vote was about spending tokens from the treasury on a certain project, the smart contract could automate the transfer of tokens to the entities working on the project. Voting power is often distributed across users based on the number of tokens they hold. For example, one user that owns 100 tokens of the DAO could have twice the weight of voting power over a user that owns 50 tokens. The theory behind DAOs is that users who are more monetarily invested in the DAO are incentivized to act in good faith. For instance, imagine that a DAO member owns a majority of the organization's voting power (a majority of the tokens). This user could act in bad faith; however, if the DAO is programmed to penalize bad actors, the user will jeopardize the value of their holdings. DAOs often have treasuries that house tokens that can be issued in exchange for fiat. Members of the DAO can vote on how to use those funds; for example, some DAOs with the intention of acquiring rare NFTs can vote on whether to relinquish treasury funds in exchange for assets. In 2021, ConstitutionDAO was formed to attempt to buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution. Though the DAO failed to acquire the asset, it proved that a collection of like-minded individuals could form and pursue such endeavors. There are several reasons why an entity or collective may want to pursue a DAO structure. Some of the benefits of this form of management include: Not everything is perfect regarding DAOS. There are some severe consequences to improperly setting up or maintaining a DAO\u2014here are some of the limitations DAOs face: A variety of individuals can collectively come together to act as a single entity. More individuals have a voice in the planning, strategy, and operations of the entity. As votes on the blockchain are publicly-viewable, tokenholders are naturally incentivized to act more responsibly. Members of a DAO may feel empowered to collaborate with like-minded individuals with similar goals within a single community. It can take longer for decisions to be made as voting participants may be distributed across time zones. There may be a burden to educate users as the collective voting population are diverse with varying ranges of education and knowledge. Severe exploits such as theft of treasury reserves are possible if the DAO's security is not properly established and maintained. The DAO was an organization designed to act as a form of venture capital fund based on open-source code without a typical management structure or board of directors. The DAO was built using the Ethereum network. The DAO launched in late April 2016 thanks to a month-long crowd sale of tokens that raised more than $150 million in funds. At the time, the launch was the largest crowdfunding campaign ever recorded. By May\u00a02016, the DAO held a large percentage of ether tokens (up to 14% of the total circulating amount), according to reporting by\u00a0The Economist).\u00a0At roughly the same time, however, a paper was published that addressed several potential security vulnerabilities, cautioning investors from voting on future investment projects until those issues had been resolved. Later, in June\u00a02016, hackers attacked the DAO based on these vulnerabilities. The hackers gained access to 3.6 million ETH, worth about $50 million at the time. This prompted a massive and contentious argument among DAO investors, with some individuals suggesting various ways of addressing the hack and others calling for the DAO to be permanently disbanded. This incident also figured prominently in the Ethereum hard forking that took place shortly thereafter, resulting from a community vote (of sorts) initiated by Ethereum developers. According to\u00a0IEEE Spectrum, the DAO was vulnerable to programming errors and attack vectors. The fact that the organization was charting new territory regarding regulation and corporate law likely did not make the process any easier. The ramifications of the organization's structure were potentially numerous: investors were concerned that they would be held liable for actions taken by the DAO as a broader organization. In July 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a report stating that The DAO sold securities in the form of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, violating U.S. securities law. The DAO also operated in murky territory regarding whether or not it was selling securities. Further, there were long-standing issues regarding how The DAO would function in the real world. Investors and contractors alike needed to convert ETH into fiat currencies, which could have impacted the value of ether. Following the contentious argument over The DAO's future and the massive hacking incident earlier in the summer, by the fall of 2016, several prominent digital currency exchanges, such as Kraken, de-listed The DAO's token, marking the effective end for The DAO as it was initially envisioned. A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, a type of bottom-up entity structure with no central authority. Members of a DAO own DAO-issued tokens and can vote on initiatives for the entity. Smart contracts are implemented for the DAO, and the code governing many DAOs' operations is open-source or publicly auditable. A DAO is an organization of people that uses blockchain technology to improve traditional top-down management structures. Instead of relying on a single individual or a small collection of individuals to guide the entity's direction, a DAO intends to give every member a voice, vote, and opportunity to propose initiatives. DAOs are legal in most jurisdictions. However, their actions must be carefully evaluated to ensure compliance with existing regulations in the geographies in which they operate. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are entities using blockchains and tokens to democratize governance to those with voting rights. Members of DAOs decide the direction of the organization and govern how it is run. The intent behind DAOs is to remove centralized control and give decision-making abilities to all users rather than leaving it up to a centralized group or person.

            "title": "How to Give Cryptocurrency As a Gift",
            "content": "Daniel Liberto is a journalist with over 10 years of experience working with publications such as the Financial Times, The Independent, and Investors Chronicle. Cryptocurrencies are no longer just the domain of the fintech crowd. Even the least technologically inclined among us have heard of cryptocurrencies, with their volatile price swings and surges in value making the news almost everywhere around the globe. Opinions on whether to invest in this asset class vary. Plenty of experts warn that digital money, such as Bitcoin, will never become entirely mainstream and are, therefore, overpriced and destined to plummet in value. Others take a more positive view, claiming that cryptocurrencies are the future. They believe that people buying cryptocurrencies now can still make a fortune and that cryptocurrencies, as a result, should be high on our shopping lists. An increasing number of ecommerce companies now accept digital assets as a payment method, meaning they can be used to shop and pay bills. Add the possibility that they could be worth a lot more in a few years, and you have a potentially versatile gift. CoinMarketCap keeps a running count of cryptocurrencies in the market, as well as the number of exchanges and total market capitalization, at the top of its website. As of October 2023, more than 8,900 cryptocurrencies were available, making choosing one harder than ever. Unless you or the person you are giving the gift to have something specific in mind, it may be best to settle on one of the more mainstream, well-established options, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana. There has been an influx of new, cheaper entrants in recent years, but it remains to be seen whether they will gain the same level of popularity and staying power as the more established coins. Cryptocurrencies are not stable investments. Prices can swing wildly from one day to the next, meaning it is essential to keep a cool head and avoid hasty buying and panic selling. Cryptocurrencies are high-risk investments, and it is crucial to review your options before buying. Do some homework on the coins that entice you most, then weigh their prospects and determine if that is reflected in the price. As this is a gift, it would also be wise to consider what the recipient might want. Thanks to their soaring popularity and partly because of their speculative nature, cryptocurrencies are now much easier to buy. Here are some common ways that these digital assets can be gifted. Several websites sell cryptocurrency gift cards. Find one that looks trustworthy, preferably with good reviews, and offers what you want, then select the amount you wish to gift and pay for it. Once the payment is made, you\u2019ll be sent a gift card worth the amount you deposited. Similar to the way that standard retailer gift cards work, the recipient can redeem the gift by going to the same website and entering the details displayed on the card. Another option is to gift cryptocurrency via an exchange. If you aren\u2019t already a crypto investor, you\u2019ll first need to choose an exchange, set up an account, and decide on a payment method. When you\u2019re up and running, purchased digital currencies can easily be sent to the giftee\u2019s wallet address. After you\u2019ve bought the gift, you\u2019ll need to find somewhere safe to store it. Generally, there is the option to hold it on the platform where it was purchased, although it\u2019s advisable to move it offline to somewhere where it cannot be hacked and stolen. The cheapest method to store cryptocurrencies offline is via paper wallet. A paper wallet can be nothing more than a piece of paper on which you write your key codes. However, you can create one by visiting a website that randomly generates keys and corresponding QR (quick response) codes. This results in a piece of paper containing the printed information you need to access your cryptocurrencies and facilitate transactions. Once you have created a paper wallet and printed it, make sure not to lose or damage it. Paper wallets are very easily damaged and lost, so it\u2019s best only to use this as a temporary storage method until you can transfer the keys to a hardware wallet (more below). A more secure storage solution is the hardware wallet. Hardware crypto wallets are essentially USB drive devices. They are small, waterproof, virus-proof, and regarded by many in the industry as the best place to ensure your private keys are safe and secure. These wallets are offline, making them harder to hack than a computer or smartphone, and can be bought relatively quickly, with various prices depending on the features they offer. Bitcoin tends to experience a fluctuating value with a range outside most people\u2019s budgets. You don\u2019t need to buy an\u00a0entire\u00a0Bitcoin, though\u2014typically, fractions of the coin are purchased instead. If you want the gift to be a bit fancier, buying or creating physical coins with the key printed on them is possible. Some use a holographic sticker on the back with the key printed on it. These coins can be quite impressive because they are custom-printed on a three-dimensional printer using metal or plastic. Physical coins should be considered a novelty or a temporary solution because they are not as secure as other storage methods. Once the gift is given, the keys should be used to transfer the cryptocurrency to a cold storage (offline) medium, and the coin should be destroyed unless it is printed on a precious metal. Giving cryptocurrency to loved ones is usually not a taxable event. Unless the transfer exceeds the gift tax allowance, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) only needs to be alerted when the asset is eventually sold by the recipient and a capital gain or loss is realized. If the recipient sells the gift within one year at a profit, they will have made a short-term capital gain, which is taxed as\u00a0ordinary income. Beyond that date, it becomes a long-term gain, which is taxed at lower capital gains rates. The size of the gain is determined by how much was paid by you, the donor. In other words, if a coin were bought for $100 and sold five years later for $500, then the gift recipient might be taxed on the profits if they met the other capital gains requirements. Because crypto values can change drastically from one hour to the next, remember to record how much you paid for the gift and how much it was worth when transferring it\u2014even if it was moments later. Without this information, the recipient will have to use the original cost basis (the price you paid), increasing their tax obligation if they sell it for a gain. Losses, which can be used as\u00a0deductions\u00a0on the investor\u2019s tax return, work slightly differently. A capital loss is only registered if the asset is sold for less than the price for which it was purchased and its fair market value when it was gifted. If a capital loss occurs, filers can claim up to a $3,000 deduction while married\u2014those filing separately can each deduct $1,500. Yes. You can purchase a\u00a0cryptocurrency gift card\u00a0from one of the handful of online retailers that offer them or take the more traditional route: buying cryptocurrency on a registered exchange and then sending it to the beneficiary\u2019s\u00a0wallet\u00a0address. Often, sending cryptocurrencies is as simple as logging into your wallet or the account where you hold them and sending the amount of your choice to the recipient\u2019s wallet address. One of the best options is to buy a hardware wallet. These readily available USB drive devices are small, waterproof, virus-proof,\u00a0and widely regarded as the safest way to store\u00a0cryptocurrencies. Giving cryptocurrency as a gift is an excellent way to introduce someone to this new form of currency and provide them with something with a chance to appreciate in value. However, they'll need to understand how to access, store, use the gift, and account for triggering any taxable events.

            "title": "How to Give NFTs as a Gift",
            "content": "Daniel Liberto is a journalist with over 10 years of experience working with publications such as the Financial Times, The Independent, and Investors Chronicle. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become a popular medium for digital art. People have literally bid thousands to own these collectibles, and some have even sold for millions. If your loved ones are into digital art and cryptocurrencies and are enticed by the possibility of striking it rich with a speculative investment, then gifting them NFTs could be a great option. An NFT is essentially a digital file that comes with ownership rights. Anything in digital format can qualify, including pieces of art, sports cards, memes, videos, and audio, and once \u201ctokenized,\u201d they can be bought and sold online. If you\u2019re new to all this, you might wonder why people spend thousands or even millions of dollars on files that they could probably quite easily view and download for free. The answer is exclusive ownership. When you buy an NFT, you receive a digital token that functions as a certificate of ownership. This title is registered and stored on a shared ledger known as the blockchain, the record-keeping technology behind the Bitcoin network, so everyone knows you are the proprietor and have the right to sell the asset. A digital file can be easily and repeatedly duplicated (it is fungible). However, there is only one or a limited number of NFT versions of it (thus, it is non-fungible). In February 2021, the 2011 meme of a flying toaster pastry cat named \u201cNyan Cat\u201d sold for 300 Ether (ETH). About a month later, a JPEG of \u201cEverydays: The First 5000 Days,\u201d a digital artwork created by Mike \u201cBeeple\u201d Winkelmann, fetched over\u00a0$69 million\u00a0at Christie\u2019s. It\u2019s not just regular art that is \u201ctokenized\u201d and sold for big bucks, either. In March 2021, Jack Dorsey (CEO of then-Twitter, now X) put up for auction an image of his first tweet as an NFT and ended up collecting more than $2.9 million for charity. NFTs are highly speculative investments, with their value being based entirely on what someone else is willing to pay for them. If you don\u2019t already have an NFT collection to gift, then you\u2019ll need to buy one. For non-cryptocurrency enthusiasts, this requires picking up a few key items first. Some NFT marketplaces now accept credit and debit cards in addition to cryptocurrency, but not all do. You\u2019ll also need a digital wallet to store NFTs and your cryptocurrency. There are several NFT marketplaces online, and each functions slightly differently, including in terms of what assets they trade.\u00a0Some sell a bit of everything, while others specialize in certain niches, such as sports and gaming. Once you\u2019ve found a suitable marketplace and obtained all the right tools to trade, it\u2019s time to set up an account and start buying. NFT marketplaces operate similarly to eBay. Usually, there are auctions where the highest bidder wins, although some offer \u201cbuy now\u201d options where NFTs are sold for a fixed price. After you\u2019ve made your purchase, the next step is to transfer the NFT to the person to whom you want to gift it. Many NFT marketplaces now offer this option, and it can usually be achieved with a few clicks of a button. Generally, you\u2019ll need to select the item you want to gift, choose the option to transfer it, and then key in the recipient\u2019s wallet address. When gifting an NFT, make sure that you input the recipient\u2019s wallet address correctly. This is a blockchain transaction, meaning that the transfer is irreversible and carries a transaction fee\u2014a payment made to compensate for the computing energy required to process and validate transactions on the blockchain. Gifts surpassing $17,000 in 2023 are taxable events in the eyes of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\u2014unless the recipient is your spouse. If you plan to be this generous and risk exceeding the lifetime gift tax exemption, you might be hit with a hefty tax bill\u2014although, in 2023 and 2024, you would need to have gifted more than $12.5 million in your life to trigger this tax. If that\u2019s not an issue, then the only tax liability will lie with the recipient when they eventually decide to sell. NFTs, like stocks, are subject to capital gains taxes (at least until the IRS publishes its official guidance on digital asset taxes). So, for example, if you bought an NFT for $500 (your cost basis) and gave it to your child, who then sold it for $1,000, your child would be taxed on a capital gain of $500. Given the newness of NFT taxation, it\u2019s probably a good idea to contact a tax advisor before buying and gifting NFTs. NFT is short for non-fungible token. If someone describes an item as non-fungible, they mean that it is unique and cannot be easily traded with something else. Fungible items can be exchanged for another good or asset of the same value, such as swapping one $10 note for two $5 notes. Non-fungibles don\u2019t work this way\u2014each one is different. Once you are equipped with all the necessary materials, including an NFT to gift and a wallet address to send it to, making a transfer is usually quite simple. Generally, it involves opening the account where the NFT is held, locating the NFT, selecting the option to transfer it, and then keying in the recipient\u2019s wallet address. On most platforms, you will be charged a transaction fee every time you send an NFT to someone else. These fees cover the computational expenses of processing and validating the transfer. You should pay careful attention to these fees, as they can be high. NFTs are digital collectibles that have become a popular form of investment or gifts. However, because they are based on blockchain networks, it is important to understand how the technology works before giving it away. Make sure that the recipient understands the security risks and costs associated with blockchain transactions so that they can enjoy your gift.

            "title": "Gemini vs. Coinbase",
            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Coinbase edges out Gemini by supporting more locations and cryptocurrencies As crypto trading attracts new and seasoned investors, platforms like Gemini and Coinbase can make it easy and safe to trade cryptocurrency. Both are well-known centralized exchanges that abide by strict U.S. regulations and are backed by large banking systems, such as J.P. Morgan. Moreover, you can access advanced options for trading on both platforms via Coinbase Pro or Gemini\u2019s ActiveTrader program. Although the exchanges are similar, differences exist. Gemini provides features that support institutional investors, while Coinbase lets you earn crypto while learning about trading. Beginners will feel comfortable using either platform. However, Coinbase has a slight edge, as it\u2019s available in more countries and offers more currency types. We reviewed Gemini and Coinbase to determine overall costs for different trading amounts and volumes, payment methods available, and the cryptocurrencies supported. We also considered ease of use, standout features, and security solutions. Plus, we looked at customer support and the functionality of their mobile applications. On Nov. 16, 2022, the lending unit of cryptocurrency investment bank Genesis Global Trading suspended redemptions and new loans due to\u00a0the collapse of FTX on Nov. 16. Following the news, crypto exchange Gemini announced delays in withdrawals from its Earn product, in which Genesis is a lending partner. Investing in cryptocurrencies, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and other Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and the markets can be extremely volatile. Consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions. This article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies nor can the accuracy or timeliness of the information be guaranteed. Gemini Intuitive application interface Insurance available for the Gemini Wallet Only available to users in over 60 countries High fees Fewer trading pairs supported Coinbase Supports investors located in over 100 countries Cash balances are FDIC-insured up to $250,000 User-friendly interface designed for beginners Complex fee structure Limited charting features in the regular version Fewer customer service options than Gemini Both platforms are suitable for beginner users, with straightforward user interfaces (UI), user-friendly mobile apps, and simple trading options. You\u2019ll also get a digital hot wallet with Gemini and Coinbase and a nice selection of informational resources. But, each exchange offers some unique features. Gemini features consist of: On Coinbase, beginner investors appreciate features, such as: Gemini and Coinbase accept fiat currencies. Gemini supports seven types: USD, AUD, CAD, EUR, GBP, SGD, and HKD, while Coinbase supports three: USD, GBP, and EUR. However, Coinbase offers many more altcoins than Gemini does. For instance, you can\u2019t purchase Dash, EOS, Cardano (ADA), and Ethereum Classic (ETC) on Gemini. Both platforms support popular currencies, including: Gemini and Coinbase are always adding new cryptocurrency options, so the number of supported currencies can vary. Coinbase supports people residing in over 100 countries, whereas Gemini traders are limited to more than 60 countries. The range of options for fiat currencies and international locations still puts both platforms in line with the best crypto exchanges. These popular exchanges adhere to the highest safety measures and U.S. regulations, making them a favorite for investors. J.P. Morgan backs both platforms, and Coinbase made its stock available on the NASDAQ in 2021 via a direct listing. Moreover, all USD balances on Gemini and Coinbase are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance on balances up to $250,000 per individual. With Gemini and Coinbase, you\u2019ll also get a two-factor authentication (2FA) process via short message service (SMS), or you can use the Authy app on Gemini or the Google Authenticator app on Coinbase. Plus, Coinbase says it keeps 98% of customer funds in cold storage, meaning it\u2019s kept offline in safe deposit boxes or vaults. Gemini holds the majority of the crypto is held in an offline, air-gapped cold storage system. Additionally, Gemini provides security options for institutional traders, such as defined user access role permissions for trading cryptocurrency or accessing the account. You can also look at devices that use your account or that are logged into it. Furthermore, you can set up address whitelisting involving a seven-day hold process, after which you can only use specific addresses for withdrawal. Gemini also insures the Gemini Wallet from security breaches or fraudulent actions. Coinbase insures users' funds as well. However, the insurance doesn't cover unauthorized access to your personal account, only breaches of Coinbase and its systems. Coinbase and Gemini charge higher fees than other popular exchange platforms. Coinbase now has a maker-taker fee structure on both the regular platform and Coinbase Pro. Previously only Coinbase Pro used this structure. For most trades you'll pay 0.50%, but as trade size increases fees decrease. Different funding methods also incur fees with debit and credit cards costing more than ACH. Gemini has a complex fee structure, especially on smaller trades. Trades under $200 incur small flat fees in various amounts. Trades above $200 incur a very steep 1.49% fee. However, you can get lower fees by using the Gemini ActiveTrader plan, which uses a maker-taker model with lower fees than Coinbase's maker-taker fee schedule. If you consistently pay via wire transfer, you can save quite a bit on Gemini since it doesn\u2019t charge fees for wire transfers, whereas Coinbase does. Gemini API users may also have lower costs than web- or app-based users. Coinbase and Gemini feature user-friendly web browsers and mobile application interfaces, a simple signup and trading process, and convenient educational tools. The mobile apps provide an experience similar to web browsers and receive favorable third-party customer reviews. Gemini provides a robust, frequently asked questions (FAQ) knowledge base and several webinars. However, it recently launched an education platform, Cryptopedia, which includes cryptocurrency trading articles on currencies, security, trading, investing, and decentralized finance (DeFi). The Gemini exchange provides customer service via email or a web request, plus the company says it monitors social channels, such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Reddit, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Users can also chat online or reach Gemini on the telephone 24/7. Similar to Gemini, Coinbase provides a comprehensive knowledge database, including a section of articles for beginners, tips and tutorials, and market updates. Users can earn crypto by watching educational videos. Coinbase doesn\u2019t offer phone-based customer service or monitoring of social channels. There is a chat button as well as a contact form. The phone number is only for fraud and account-locking situations, not general service. Both Gemini and Coinbase are well-rounded platforms that cater to investors of all types, including beginners. However, Coinbase offers more available cryptocurrencies and locations than Gemini. Therefore, if you're looking for a greater amount of supported cryptocurrencies, or you are investing from a country where Gemini is not available, Coinbase is likely your best option. Gemini and Coinbase are crypto exchange platforms allowing traders to buy, sell, and trade various altcoins online. Both are U.S.-regulated exchanges, meaning they comply with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer (KYC) initiatives. People who want to start investing in cryptocurrencies use simple tools like the Gemini and Coinbase exchanges to get started and learn the tricks of trading. Although each platform is straightforward to use, complete newbies may prefer Coinbase\u2019s streamlined view. Coinbase and Gemini are cryptocurrency exchanges that serve as online brokerages for consumer investors. New users sign up for an account, verify their email address, connect a payment method and, in accordance with U.S. rules, verify their identity and address. With Gemini and Coinbase, you can buy altcoin and then store it until you want to withdraw funds to your digital wallet. You also have the option to trade some currencies for others, called trading pairs. In many common cases, your trade will be cheaper at Coinbase paying the 0.50% maker-taker fee vs. the 1.49% Gemini charges on trades over $200. However, if you use a credit card to pay for your crypto, you\u2019ll pay 3.99% on Coinbase and 3.49% on Gemini. Moreover, Gemini doesn\u2019t charge for wire transfers, whereas Coinbase charges $10 per deposit. If you opt for Gemini ActiveTrader, you\u2019ll pay maker-taker fees that are lower than Coinbase for common trade sizes. However, at some larger trade sizes, the trend may flip. Beginners will be comfortable using Gemini and Coinbase, as both are secure and user-friendly. However, Gemini also offers features for institutional investors, allowing fund managers to track device use and access permissions. Plus, access to customer service is much easier on the Gemini exchange. However, new users may prefer the quicker onboarding process of the Coinbase platform, including earning crypto while learning about trading. The Coinbase exchange looks and feels slightly more accessible than Gemini. We compared Gemini versus Coinbase by looking at shared attributes and differences in customer service options, security levels, and supported countries. Moreover, we considered the variety of cryptocurrencies available to trade, fiat currencies accepted, and deposit and withdrawal methods. We reviewed standout features, self-help guidance, and the popularity and ease of use of mobile applications to narrow down our options.

            "title": "Cryptocurrency Hard Forks vs. Airdrops: What's the Difference?",
            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. If you've followed the cryptocurrency world for even a short time, it's likely that you've heard both the terms hard fork and airdrop come up before. Perhaps you've even seen the totals in your digital currency wallet increase for no apparent reason at all and then discovered it was the result of an airdrop. Airdrops and hard forks are similar in some ways, and, at times, this has led to confusion among cryptocurrency investors. However, there are important distinctions between these two operations. A hard fork occurs when there is a permanent split in a blockchain. This split occurs when there is a change to the code; this creates two paths. One path has the new blockchain, and the second path has the original blockchain. An airdrop occurs when a new cryptocurrency token is deposited directly into users\u2019 wallets. If a virtual currency forks into two, an airdrop may be used to send the new cryptocurrency straight to users\u2019 wallets. A hard fork is when the developers of a digital currency create a second branch of that currency using the same basic code. Most of the time, a hard fork occurs after deliberation and discussion among the development team, the miners of a cryptocurrency, and occasionally, investing communities. If different factions wish to take the cryptocurrency in various directions, a hard fork may be necessary. For this reason, the two copies of the digital currency are not exactly the same; rather, the original currency typically goes on as it has before, while the new iteration adopts some different protocols and adjustments to the code. Sometimes hard forks are not the result of a dispute between developers and miners\u00a0but are rather\u00a0simply an attempt to create a different version of a preexisting coin. Hard forks have historically been some of the most-hyped moments in the cryptocurrency world. When Bitcoin has forked, for instance, it has generated massive amounts of investor speculation and conversation. The Bitcoin cash hard fork was a prime example of this phenomenon. Of course, as time goes\u00a0on, there have been dozens of Bitcoin forks, with many of them mostly flying under the radar. An airdrop, by contrast, is the delivery of a cryptocurrency to a certain group of investors. This can happen via procedures like ICO purchases and as a freebie offering by developers. In airdrops, tokens are typically allocated to holders of a preexisting blockchain, like Bitcoin or Ethereum. It is this last point that creates confusion about the difference between an airdrop and a hard fork. In each case, it's common for holders of a prior digital currency to be given new tokens, typically in an equivalent volume to their current holdings. In the case of the Bitcoin cash hard fork mentioned above, for instance, holders of Bitcoin were given an equivalent amount of Bitcoin cash tokens at a time designated by the developers of the fork. In other cases, an airdrop takes place primarily as a means of boosting recognition for a new token or coin. Holders of Bitcoin and Ethereum may be surprised to see the addition of new currencies to specific wallets (as many airdrops happen unannounced). Some in the digital currency community find airdrops of this type to be largely a waste of time, as many of these free giveaways end up creating a surplus of coins in the market. Investors who have suddenly been given tokens for free often turn around and sell those tokens. If enough people do this, the price of the new token will tend\u00a0to drop considerably. Some cryptocurrencies have failed to get off the ground as a result of this scenario. In these cases, an airdrop is distinct from a hard fork in that it doesn't create two iterations of the same basic cryptocurrency. Rather it leads to the generation of a new cryptocurrency that may or may not succeed\u00a0over the long term. Investing in\u00a0cryptocurrencies\u00a0and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by\u00a0Investopedia\u00a0or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies\u00a0or ICOs.

            "url": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mining-pool.asp",
            "title": "Mining Pool: Definition, How It Works, Methods, and Benefits",
            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. A mining pool is a group of cryptocurrency miners who connect their mining machines over a network to boost their chances of earning the reward for opening a new block. New blocks are opened when a miner discovers the solution to the problem the entire blockchain network is trying to solve. This process is time-consuming, energy-intensive, and requires a computer that can generate and check trillions of hexadecimal numbers per second. Because it can take years to become profitable after purchasing, running, cooling, and maintaining mining machines capable of this, joining a mining pool is the most affordable way to increase the odds of receiving a cryptocurrency reward. Individually, participants in a mining pool contribute their processing power toward the effort of finding a block. If the pool is successful in these efforts, they receive a reward, typically in the form of the associated cryptocurrency. Rewards are usually divided between the individuals who contributed according to the proportion of each individual's processing power or work relative to the whole group, usually called shares. In most cases, the pool's software takes care of calculating share payouts and sending them to the users' wallets. Rewards are usually split among the miners based on the pool's payout scheme. Some schemes are pay per share (PPS), pay per last N shares (PPLNS), and pay per share plus (PPS+). Each pays based on the share of work contributed, with different payout calculations for each type. Not all cryptocurrency mining pools function in the same way. However, there are a few common protocols that govern many of the most popular mining pools. Proportional mining pools are among the most common. In this type of pool, miners contributing to the pool's processing power send shares of work to the pool until the point at which the pool succeeds in finding a block. Miners then receive rewards proportional to the number of shares they submitted for that block. Peer-to-peer mining pools aim to prevent the pool structure from becoming centralized. As such, they integrate a separate blockchain related to the pool itself and are designed to prevent the pool operators from cheating and the pool itself from failing due to a single central issue. There have been many different types of payout schemes tried by many pools in the past, but the majority of pools now use one of four: PPS is a fairly simple payout method\u2014you're paid for the shares or blocks you contribute to the pool. PPS+ and FPPS are generally the same thing\u2014you receive a proportional amount of the reward based on the quality of the shares you provided, and the pool pays a transaction fee reward. PPLNS might be slightly more confusing\u2014when a block is \"found,\" the pool software locates the last blocks you contributed after the last and new winning blocks were found. The number of trial blocks (or shares) you contributed between that time dictates your payout. This usually means you'll need to stay connected to the pool until a block is found. If you disconnect between blocks, you'll likely lose your contributions and payout. While success in individual mining grants complete ownership of\u00a0the reward, the odds of achieving success are very low because of high computational power and resource requirements. Many cryptocurrencies have become increasingly difficult to mine, and the competition for mineable cryptocurrencies has increased tremendously. Mining pools give everyone a fighting chance against (or a chance to work with) those who have built vast, ultra-expensive mining farms. Mining also pools require less of each participant in terms of hardware and electricity costs, thus increasing the chances of paying any associated expenses and profiting. By taking part in a mining pool, individuals give up some of their autonomy in the mining process. They are typically bound by terms set by the pool itself, which may dictate how the mining process is approached. They are also required to divide up any potential rewards, meaning that the share of earnings is lower for an individual participating in a pool. A small number of mining pools\u2014AntPool, Foundry, ViaBTC, F2Pool, and Binance Pool\u2014dominate the Bitcoin mining process, according to Blockchain.com. Although many pools try to be decentralized, these groups consolidate much of the Bitcoin blockchain. For some cryptocurrency proponents, this centralization goes against the intended decentralized structure Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are supposed to represent. However, it has become necessary for users to participate in pools if they want to receive rewards and help the blockchain function. The best mining pool is the one that uses a payout scheme you prefer and which is transparent about how it operates. In general, the bigger and faster the pool is, the more you are likely to receive\u2014to a point. There is likely a point where pools can be too large to be beneficial for individual miners. A mining pool is a network of cryptocurrency miners that combine their processing power to mine crypto. You connect your client to the pool, the pool assigns work to you based on its criteria, and you receive payouts based on the work your mining rig submits to the pool. Mining pools can make money if they charge for their services, which some have started doing. Because cryptocurrency mining and rewards are based on who finds the solution first, the network has become dominated by a few large groups. These mining pools are generally the only way a solo or smaller hash-rate miner can earn crypto because they hash at a significantly higher rate. If you're looking into crypto mining to supplement your income or earn some as an investment, it is worth joining a pool to reduce your overall costs and increase your chances. Be sure to investigate and understand their payout schemes and requirements before jumping into the pool.

Kraken balances geographic restrictions with lower fees Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning. Kraken and Coinbase are two of the most high-profile crypto exchange platforms in the world. Each allows you to buy various currencies using fiat money (U.S. dollars or Euro, for example) and works equally well for both experienced and novice investors. Both high- and low-volume traders enjoy Kraken\u2019s low-fee services and high trading limits. New investors based in the United States appreciate the convenience of Coinbase\u2019s digital wallet and funding options. Unlike Kraken, Coinbase caters to U.S.-based traders, and you can learn more about this platform by reading our in-depth Coinbase review. In this article, we weigh the pros and cons of Kraken and Coinbase and explore their distinctive features, security, fees, ease of use, and more. While both platforms offer appealing elements like mobile apps and 24/7 customer service, each has advantages that will appeal to different investors. Kraken offers flat purchasing fees, which is an excellent benefit for lower-volume traders. Coinbase provides easy funding options like PayPal and debit cards, ideal for U.S. traders. On Nov. 21, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Kraken for allegedly violating multiple infractions. Kraken is accused of commingling customer funds with company funds and operating an unregistered securities exchange, clearing agency, dealer, and broker. Both allegations may impact the operation of the cryptocurrency exchange and its customers' investments. To go with the lawsuit, on Feb. 9, 2023, Kraken agreed to pay $30 million in fines and closed its staking operation to settle with the SEC. However, Kraken is allowed to continue its staking process through its subsidiary for non-U.S. clients.  In August 2024, U.S. Judge William. J. Orrick upheld the SEC\u2019s suit against Kraken, paving way for the case to proceed to trial. Kraken Secure and reliable Low fees High deposit and withdrawal limits Accepts some fiat currency Many options not available to U.S. users Long verification times Possibly challenging user interface Coinbase Excellent user experience Easy funding options Fiat currencies accepted Not available in all countries Some coins aren\u2019t accepted High fees Both of these cryptocurrency exchanges successfully cater to seasoned investors and first-timers. Still, Kraken offers features ideal for global investors or U.S. traders who don\u2019t mind giving up convenience for lower fees and additional services. Coinbase\u2019s digital options facilitate processes for U.S. investors. With both Kraken and Coinbase, you\u2019ll get: On July 31st of 2024, Kraken shut down Cryptowatch, a trading platform it had acquired in 2017, that analyzed and generated data on over 2,000 cryptocurrency markets. The functionality is now integrated into Kraken Pro, the company\u2019s own trading platform. One of Coinbase\u2019s standout features used to be Coinbase Wallet, a hot wallet that can be used to deposit, store, and withdraw currency. You don\u2019t need to be a Coinbase user to use the wallet, making it ideal for traders that transfer between various fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. As of April 2024, Kraken also began to offer similar functionality via Kraken Wallet. Both exchanges support USD, EUR, CAD, AUD, GBP, CHF, and JPY fiat currencies. Coinbase has over 240 cryptocurrencies available to trade, while Kraken has well over 200. Each provider offers different choices, so users looking for something specific can search both to find what they want. For instance, Kraken offers Flow (FLOW) and Icon (ICX). You can trade Filecoin (FIL) and Yearn Finance (YFI) on Coinbase but not Tron (TRX) or Siacoin (SC). In addition to Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrencies supported by Kraken and Coinbase include: Security measures are crucial when considering which exchange to use. Both platforms have solid security and regulatory track records, and neither has had any significant breaches. Kraken stores the majority of its assets in guarded air-gapped cold storage and has strict surveillance across the entire platform and multiple checkpoints throughout the signup process. Coinbase keeps 98% of deposits in offline, geographically distributed cold storage. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures up to $250,000 of an individual\u2019s USD cash balances, a plus for U.S. traders. On the user side, Kraken and Coinbase offer these multi-layered security features: One significant divide between Kraken and Coinbase comes in the form of transaction fee structures. Kraken's maker-taker fees are amongst the lowest in the industry. Coinbase's maker-taker fees are significantly higher. Kraken calculates transaction fees according to the volume you trade in a 30-day rolling period. The fee schedule includes: Coinbase's maker-taker schedule is considerably more expensive topping out at 0.60%. A $1000 trade on Coinbase would cost $4 for Maker, $6 for Taker. The same exact trade on Kraken would cost $2.5 for Market, and $4 for Taker. The user experience for Kraken and Coinbase ranks high. They both provide a reliable experience on desktops and mobile devices. Kraken\u2019s stringent security measures are a bonus for large-sum investors, but the added precautions can be trying for users who want to start trading quickly. Coinbase offers a quick startup process and keeps trading features and funding options simple, allowing inexperienced investors to trade right away. Coinbase enables new users to start trading with only a phone number verification. With added verification steps, users can unlock higher account levels and limits. While both Coinbase and Kraken are highly trusted cryptocurrency exchange platforms, Coinbase's benefits are more specific to U.S. traders, while Kraken is the best for international traders overall. It has some of the lowest fees in the industry and offers robust security for users. Additionally, the platform offers support for customers in 190 countries, whereas Coinbase is available in a little more than 100. However, as a result of a 2023 settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Kraken is ending staking services to U.S. clients. Therefore, U.S. traders will need to look to other platforms, such as Coinbase, for those services. We compared Kraken and Coinbase side-by-side to uncover the overall cost of trading on the platform, including deposit and withdrawal fees, while considering supported fiat currencies. For both platforms, we looked at multi-layer security options and past incidences of security breaches. We also reviewed transaction types and how options differ for people living in different locations. Furthermore, we explored the quantity and popularity of supported cryptocurrencies while giving points for advanced features, such as offering a digital wallet or market watch tools. Investing in cryptocurrencies, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and other Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and the markets can be extremely volatile.

            "content": "Learn what you need to know before you invest in a virtual currency Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, most often based on blockchain technology. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Most cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks using blockchain technology\u2014a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation. Investopedia / Tara Anand Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. \"Crypto\" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions. Central to the appeal and functionality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is blockchain technology. As its name indicates, a blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks of information on an online ledger. Each block contains a set of transactions that have been independently verified by each validator on a network. Every new block generated must be verified before being confirmed, making it almost impossible to forge transaction histories. The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by a network of individual nodes, or computers that maintain the ledger. Experts say that blockchain technology can serve multiple industries, supply chains, and processes such as online voting and crowdfunding. Financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) are using blockchain technology to lower transaction costs by streamlining payment processing. Many cryptocurrencies were created to facilitate work done on the blockchain they are built on. For example, Ethereum's ether was designed to be used as payment for validating transactions and opening blocks. When the blockchain transitioned to proof-of-stake in September 2022, ether (ETH) inherited an additional duty as the blockchain's staking mechanism. The XRP Ledger Foundation's XRP is designed for financial institutions to facilitate transfers between different geographies. Because there are so many cryptocurrencies on the market, it's important to understand the types. Knowing whether the coin you're looking at has a purpose can help you decide whether it is worth investing in\u2014a cryptocurrency with a purpose is likely to be less risky than one that doesn't have a use. Most of the time, when you hear about cryptocurrency types, you hear the coin's name. However, coin names differ from coin types. Here are some of the types you'll find with some of the names of tokens in that category: If you find a cryptocurrency that doesn't fall into one of these categories, you've found a new category or something that needs to be investigated to be sure it's legitimate. If you want to use cryptocurrency to buy products and services, you will need to visit a cryptocurrency exchange. These are businesses that allow you to buy or sell cryptocurrencies from other users at the current market price, similar to a stock. After buying the coins, you will need to transfer them to a digital wallet or use a third-party service like Coinbase to store your coins. If you only want to buy cryptocurrency as an investment, you may be able to do so through your brokerage. For example, Robinhood allows users to invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, although you cannot withdraw them from the platform for purchases. In addition, there are several crypto ETFs that provide exposure to the crypto asset class without requiring the investors to maintain their own wallets. For instance, as of May 2024, investors may choose to hold Bitcoin futures ETF shares. The SEC has also approved the listing and trading of Ether spot shares. Fiat currencies derive their authority from the government or monetary authorities. For example, the U.S. dollar is recognized and issued by the government as the official currency of the United States and is \"legal tender.\" But cryptocurrencies are not issued by any public or private entities. Therefore, it has been difficult to make a case for their legal status in different financial jurisdictions throughout the world. It doesn't help matters that cryptocurrencies have primarily functioned outside most existing financial infrastructure. The legal status of cryptocurrencies creates implications for their use in daily transactions and trading. In June 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommended that wire transfers of cryptocurrencies should be subject to the requirements of its Travel Rule, which requires AML compliance. Although cryptocurrencies are considered a form of money, the Internal Revenue Service\u00a0(IRS) treats them as financial assets or property for tax purposes. And, as with most other investments, if you reap capital gains selling or trading cryptocurrencies, the government wants a piece of the profits. How exactly the IRS taxes digital assets\u2014either as capital gains or ordinary income\u2014depends on how long the taxpayer held the cryptocurrency and how they used it. In the United States in July 2023, courts ruled that cryptocurrencies are considered securities when purchased by institutional buyers but not by retail investors purchased on exchanges. Enthusiasts called it a victory for crypto; however, crypto exchanges are regulated by the SEC, as are coin offerings or sales to institutional investors. So, crypto is legal in the U.S., but regulatory agencies are slowly gaining ground in the industry. As of June 2024, El Salvador is the only country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender for monetary transactions. In the rest of the world, cryptocurrency regulation varies by jurisdiction. Japan's Payment Services Act defines Bitcoin as legal property. Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country are required to collect information about the customer and details relating to the wire transfer. China has banned cryptocurrency exchanges, transactions, and mining within its borders, but has a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). India was reported to be formulating a framework for cryptocurrencies, but until it is enacted, crypto is not yet illegal. Exchanges are free to offer cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are legal in the European Union. Derivatives and other products that use cryptocurrencies must qualify as \"financial instruments.\" In June 2023, the European Commission's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation went into effect. This law sets safeguards and establishes rules for companies or vendors providing financial services using cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies have attracted a reputation as unstable investments due to high investor losses from scams, hacks, bugs, and volatility. Although the underlying cryptography and blockchain are generally secure, the technical complexity of using and storing crypto assets can be a significant hazard to new users. In addition to the market risks associated with speculative assets, cryptocurrency investors should be aware of the following risks: Despite these risks, cryptocurrencies have seen a significant price leap, with the total market capitalization rising to about $2.4 trillion. Despite the asset's speculative nature, some have created substantial fortunes by taking on the risk of investing in early-stage cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies were introduced with the intent to revolutionize financial infrastructure. As with every revolution, however, there are tradeoffs involved. At the current stage of development for cryptocurrencies, there are many differences between the theoretical ideal of a decentralized system with cryptocurrencies and its practical implementation. Removes single points of failure Easier to transfer funds between parties Removes third parties Can be used to generate returns Remittances are streamlined Transactions are pseudonymous Pseudonymity allows for criminal uses Have become highly centralized Expensive to participate in a network and earn Off-chain security issues Prices are very volatile Cryptocurrencies represent a new, decentralized paradigm for money. In this system, centralized intermediaries, such as banks and monetary institutions, are not necessary to enforce trust and police transactions between two parties. Thus, a system with cryptocurrencies eliminates the possibility of a single point of failure\u2014such as a large financial institution setting off a cascade of global crises, such as the one triggered in 2008 by the failure of large investment banks in the U.S. Cryptocurrencies promise to make transferring funds directly between two parties easier without needing a trusted third party like a bank or a credit card company. Such decentralized transfers are secured by the use of public keys and private keys and different forms of incentive systems, such as proof of work or proof of stake. Because they do not use third-party intermediaries, cryptocurrency transfers between two transacting parties can be faster than standard money transfers. Flash loans in decentralized finance are an excellent example of such decentralized transfers. These loans, which are processed without requiring collateral, can be executed within seconds and are mostly used in trading. The remittance economy is testing one of cryptocurrency's most prominent use cases. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin serve as intermediate currencies to streamline money transfers across borders. Thus, a fiat currency is converted to Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency), transferred across borders, and subsequently converted to the destination fiat currency without third-party involvement. Though they claim to be an anonymous form of transaction, cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous. They leave a digital trail that agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can follow. This opens up the possibility for governments, authorities, and others to track financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies have become a popular tool with criminals for nefarious activities such as money laundering and illicit purchases. The case of Dread Pirate Roberts, who ran a marketplace to sell drugs on the dark web, is already well known. Cryptocurrencies have also become a favorite of hackers who use them for ransomware activities. In theory, cryptocurrencies are meant to be decentralized, their wealth distributed between many parties on a blockchain. Ownership is becoming more concentrated, as witnessed by companies purchasing and holding them for price appreciation and investment fund managers buying them to hold in their funds. One of the conceits of cryptocurrencies is that anyone can mine them using a computer with an Internet connection. However, mining popular cryptocurrencies requires considerable energy, sometimes as much energy as entire countries consume. The expensive energy costs and the unpredictability of mining have concentrated mining among large firms whose revenues run into billions of dollars. Only 61 (1%) of the 4,568 Bitcoin blocks opened from May 15, 2024, to June 15, 2024, were opened by unknown addresses. The other 99% were opened by mining pools. Though cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, off-chain crypto-related key storage repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, can be hacked. Many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets have been hacked over the years, sometimes resulting in the theft of millions of dollars in coins. Cryptocurrencies traded in public markets suffer from price volatility, so investments require accurate price monitoring. For example, Bitcoin has experienced rapid surges and crashes in its value, climbing to nearly $65,000 in November 2021 before dropping to just over $20,000 a year and a half later. Bitcoin prices had roared back by mid-2024. As a result of this vast range of volatility, many people consider cryptocurrencies a speculative bubble. Crypto can be a good investment for someone who enjoys speculating and can financially tolerate losing everything invested. However, it is not a wise investment for someone seeking to grow their retirement portfolio or for placing savings into it for growth. One definition of money is something that is generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure or store of value, and a unit of account. By this definition, cryptocurrency is real money. There are several ways cryptocurrency can make money for you. Decentralized finance applications let you loan your crypto with interest; you can stake a compatible one on a blockchain or at certain exchanges for rewards, or you can hold on to it and hope its market value increases. None of these methods are guaranteed to make money, but many people have benefitted from them. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that are secured by cryptography. As a relatively new technology, they are highly speculative, and it is important to understand the risks involved before investing.

            "title": "Axie Infinity: What It Is and How It Works",
            "content": "Casey Murphy has fanned his passion for finance through years of writing about active trading, technical analysis, market commentary, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), commodities, futures, options, and forex (FX). Axie Infinity is an online game that implements blockchain and cryptocurrency concepts to incentivize gameplay. It uses a play-to-earn model where players buy monsters and play to earn non-fungible tokens, in-game currency, and Axie Infinity Shards (AXS). In June 2022, the original Axie Infinity game, now called Axie Infinity Classic, was shut down and replaced with Axie Infinity Origins. Axie Infinity Classic was brought back in November 2022, and both versions can be played to earn AXS. Axie Infinity is an online game universe revolving around Pok\u00e9mon-esque creatures known as Axies. Players can collect Axies as virtual pets with aspirations to battle, breed, collect, raise, and build kingdoms for their Axies. What makes Axie Infinity different than other online games is the synergy it has established between standard online gaming and blockchain. The Ethereum-based game utilizes a design that allows players to own their virtual assets and for the game to reward players who are able to reach an advanced skill level. To get started, users must go through a multi-step setup process to connect digital wallets, their Axie Infinity account, and a social account, which is detailed in the game\u2019s onboarding guide. Once the accounts are successfully connected, the player can interact with the digital marketplace and log in with their wallet. To play, users need three Axies, which they can purchase by depositing ETH on their Ronin wallet and buying them on the marketplace. Alternatively, a player can join the Axie Discord and apply for a scholarship. Once the player has three Axies, they can download the application and start playing. There is a lot of nuance around the cost of an Axie since the average price fluctuates based on factors such as rarity, experience, attributes, and type. At the time of writing, the least expensive Axies are known as \u2018Floor Axies.\u2019 Floor Axies are often weak in battle and likely won\u2019t be able to earn much for their owner. At the time of writing, players can expect to pay a few U.S. dollars for a Floor Axie to thousands of dollars for a rare Mystic Axie. In-game digital assets such as the Axie creatures are represented by NFTs. These cryptographically unique tokens confer ownership and allow the player to trade Axies or other assets on the game\u2019s marketplace. In the realm of NFT projects, Axie Infinity holds the record for the fifth-highest all-time sales. As of October 2024, Axie Infinity generated $4.31 billion in all-time NFT sales, ranking below Opensea\u2019s $37.67 billion, Blur's $11.32 billion, LooksRare\u2019s reported $4.86 billion, and Magic Eden's $4.38 billion. The play-to-earn business model is designed to reward participants who add value to the game's world or ecosystem. This model is predominantly based on making an initial investment of purchasing Axies to begin earning. The user can then play and earn virtual currency to purchase more in-game items. It's important to note that this model is not designed to generate a living income, although there are rumors of easy money made in the past. It's likely that more people have lost money on the game trying to make money from it than have made money. Axie Infinity Shards (AXS) are ERC-20-compliant governance tokens for the Axie Universe. It can be thought of as the native currency of the game: holders can claim rewards if they stake their tokens, play the game, and participate in key governance votes. The AXS tokens, in addition to being used in the game, are an intentional move by Sky Mavis to decentralize the ownership and governance of Axie Infinity so that the developers and the game's player community can work together to evolve it. Smooth Love Potion (SLP) is a reward token within the Axie Infinity Origins game that players can earn by playing the game in battle or adventure mode (SLP is no longer earned in the Classic version). SLP is a utility token that carries a market value like other cryptocurrencies and can be bought and sold on a decentralized exchange. SLP is designed to be used in-game, similar to experience points (XP) in other games that can be accumulated and spent. Lunacia, the Axie homeland, has tokenized plots of virtual land that act as operational home bases for players\u2019 Axies. The idea behind these virtual plots is that players can purchase them or apply to be stewards (rental). Plot owners can place the plots on the Axie Infinity marketplace and delegate ownership to a steward who rents the land. Virtual landowners (or stewards) can earn AXS tokens on their plots and different types of resources that spawn in nodes across Lunacia. These resources can be used to upgrade Axies and land. Axie Infinity Shards (AXS) have utility within the game as they can be used for purchases. Outside the game, AXS appears to have some trading volume on several exchanges. It can be held as a speculative investment; however, the virtual currency is put to best use when purchased by players who intend to use it within the game. Axie Infinity is rumored to have made some players money, but the chances of making a livable income are very low. Axie Infinity had millions of players shortly after it launched, but the player base has dropped dramatically since. It is still played by thousands of people and is being actively developed, so it may exist in the future. The convergence of the crypto universe with online gaming in the form of Axie Infinity marked an interesting shift in the future of not only online gaming but also the growing importance of digital ownership. The game's developments since its release demonstrate once again that there are interesting uses for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and some people enjoy the speculation that accompanies them. Investors should be cautious before investing in blockchain and cryptocurrency projects, but if the game's play-to-earn model appeals to you and you enjoy playing it, there's nothing wrong with purchasing some AXS and using it to play the game.

            "title": "What Are Crypto Tokens, and How Do They Work?",
            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. A crypto token is a representation of an asset or interest that has been tokenized on an existing cryptocurrency's blockchain. Crypto tokens and cryptocurrencies share many similarities, but cryptocurrencies are the native asset of a blockchain. Crypto tokens are often used to raise funds for projects and are usually created, distributed, sold, and circulated through an initial coin offering (ICO) process, which involves a crowdfunding round. Although there were cryptocurrencies that forked from Bitcoin and Ethereum previous to the 2017 ICO boom, the first recognized ICO and token was Mastercoin. Mastercoin was created by J.R. Willet and announced on January 2012 via Bitcoin Forum. He titled his whitepaper \"The Second Bitcoin Whitepaper.\" Mastercoin was one of the first projects to describe using layers to enhance a cryptocurrency's functionality. The project linked the value of Mastercoin to Bitcoin's value and explained how the project would use the funds to pay developers to create a way for users to make new coins from their Mastercoins. Between 2012 and 2016, crypto token creation and ICO increased until 2017\u2014token offerings skyrocketed as investors seemed to become aware of them and the possible increase in value they promised. Developers, businesses, and scammers began creating tokens rapidly in attempts to take advantage of the fund-raising boom\u2014so much so that regulatory agencies began issuing alerts to investors warning them about the risks of ICOs. Not all crypto tokens and ICOs are scams. Many are legitimate efforts to raise funds for projects or startups. The ICO bubble burst in 2018\u2014shortly after, initial exchange offerings (IEO) emerged, where exchanges began facilitating token offerings. Exchanges claimed to have vetted the token offerings, reducing the risks to investors; however, scammers used the exchanges to promote their scams. Regulatory agencies issued alerts to investors about the risks involved in participating in an IEO; they also alerted exchanges that they were required to register with the authorities if they were facilitating these fund-raising efforts. The logic was that the exchanges might be acting as alternative trading systems or broker/dealers, which by law are required to register. Crypto tokens are still being created and used to raise funds for projects through ICOs. Whitepapers read like pitchbooks, outlining the token's purpose, how it will be sold, how the funds will be used, and how investors will benefit. The single most important concern about crypto tokens is that because they are used to raise funds, they can be and have been used by scammers to steal money from investors. However, it can be difficult to distinguish between a scam token and one representing an actual business endeavor. Here are some factors to look for when you're looking at a crypto token: Crypto or cryptography refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard crypto tokens and currencies, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are virtual currencies on a blockchain. These systems that allow for secure online payments and the storing of value. Crypto tokens are transactional units created on top of existing blockchains by blockchain companies or projects. They are created using standard templates like that of the Ethereum network. Such blockchains work on the concept of smart contracts or decentralized applications, wherein the programmable, self-executing code is used to process and manage the various transactions that occur. A smart contract is a self-executing program that automates transactions. Two parties agree on terms. Then code is written to execute the transaction once the agreed upon terms are met. For example, you might receive a crypto token representing a certain number of customer loyalty points on a blockchain that manages such details for a retail chain. Another crypto token might give the token holder the entitlement to view 10 hours of streaming content on a video-sharing blockchain.\u00a0A token can even represent other cryptocurrencies, such as a crypto token equalling 15 bitcoins on a particular blockchain. Such crypto tokens are tradable and transferrable among the various participants of the blockchain Investors can use crypto tokens for any number of reasons. They can hold onto them to represent a stake in the cryptocurrency company or for an economic reason\u2014to trade or make purchases of goods and services. As a practical example, decentralized storage provider Bluzelle allows you to stake your tokens to help secure its network while earning transaction fees and rewards. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) continues to issue alerts about cryptocurrency and token fraud, so be sure you research before investing in any cryptocurrency\u2014the same way you would with any stock. The term crypto token is often erroneously used interchangeably with \"cryptocurrency.\" However, these terms are distinct from one another. A cryptocurrency is used for making or receiving payments using a blockchain, with the most popular cryptocurrency being Bitcoin (BTCUSD). Altcoins are alternative cryptocurrencies that were launched after the massive success achieved by Bitcoin. The term means alternative coins\u2014that is\u2014cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. They were launched as enhanced Bitcoin substitutes that have claimed to overcome some of Bitcoin's pain points. Litecoin (LTCUSD), Bitcoin Cash (BCHUSD), Namecoin, and Dogecoin (DOGEUSD) are typical examples of altcoins. Though each has tasted varying levels of success, none have managed to gain popularity akin to Bitcoin's. While cryptocurrencies have their own blockchain and are its native asset, crypto tokens are built on an existing blockchain, which acts as a medium for the creation and execution of decentralized apps and smart contracts. The tokens are used to facilitate transactions on the blockchain. In many cases, tokens go through an ICO and then transistion to this stage after the ICO completes. Crypto tokens generally facilitate transactions on a blockchain but can represent an investor's stake in a company or serve an economic purpose, similar to legal tender. However, tokens are not legal tender. This means token holders can use them to make purchases or trades just like other securities to make a profit. Bitcoin is a coin also known as a cryptocurrency. It can be used to trade, store value, or make purchases. The main difference is that crypto coins have their own independent blockchain, whereas tokens are built on an existing blockchain. Crypto coins are designed to be used as currency, while crypto tokens are intended to represent an interest in an asset and facilitate transactions on a blockchain. Blockchain tokens include reward, utility, security, governance, and asset tokens. Crypto tokens are digital representations of interest in an asset or used to facilitate transactions on a blockchain. They are often confused with cryptocurrency because they are also tradeable and exchangeable. Crypto tokens are often used as a way to raise funds for projects in initial coin offerings. ICOs have been abused by many parties to fool investors into contributing funds, only to disappear, but many are valid fundraising attempts by legitimate businesses. If you're considering crypto tokens as an investment, be sure to do your research on the team or company offering them. Investing in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

            "title": "What Is a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)?",
            "content": "A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a form of digital currency issued by a country's central bank. It is similar to cryptocurrencies, except that its value is fixed by the central bank and is equivalent to the country's fiat currency. Many countries are developing CBDCs, and some have even implemented them. Because so many countries are researching ways to transition to digital currencies, it's important to understand what CBDCs are and what they mean for society. Fiat money is a government-issued currency that has no physical commodity like gold or silver backing it up. It is considered a form of legal tender that can be exchanged for goods and services. Traditionally, fiat money has been banknotes and coins, but technology has allowed governments and financial institutions to supplement physical fiat money with a credit-based currency model that records balances and transactions digitally. Physical currency is still widely exchanged and accepted. However, some developed countries have experienced a drop in its use, and that trend accelerated during the pandemic. The introduction and evolution of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have spurred additional interest in cashless societies and digital currencies. Governments and central banks worldwide are exploring the possibility of using government-backed digital currencies. When and if they are implemented, these currencies would have the full faith and backing of the government that issues them, just as fiat money does. In the U.S. and many other countries, many individuals don't have access to financial services. In the U.S. alone, 6% of adults had no bank account in 2023. In many other countries, the numbers are much higher. With that in mind, the main purposes of CBDCs are: A CBDC also provides a country's central bank with the means to implement monetary policies to ensure stability, control growth, and influence inflation. There are two types of CBDCs: wholesale and retail. Financial institutions are the primary users of wholesale CBDCs, whereas consumers and businesses use retail CBDCs. Wholesale CBDCs function similarly to holding reserves in a central bank. The central bank grants an institution an account in which to deposit funds or to use to settle interbank transfers. Central banks can then use monetary policy tools, such as reserve requirements or interest on reserve balances, to set interest rates and influence lending. Retail CBDCs are government-backed digital currencies used by consumers and businesses. Retail CBDCs eliminate intermediary risk\u2014the risk that private digital currency issuers might become bankrupt and lose customers' assets. There are two types of retail CBDCs. They differ in how individual users access and use their currency: It is possible to develop and implement the two types of CBDCs and have them function in the same economy. The Federal Reserve has identified issues addressed by CBDCs, as well as matters that must be addressed before a CBDC can be designed and implemented. Free from credit and liquidity risk Lower cross-border payment costs Support the international role of the dollar Aim for financial inclusion Expand access to the general public Financial structure changes Financial system stability Monetary policy influence Privacy and protection Cybersecurity The cryptocurrency ecosystem provides a glimpse of an alternative currency system in which cumbersome regulations don't dictate the terms of each transaction. Such transactions are hard to duplicate or counterfeit and are secured by consensus mechanisms that prevent tampering. Central bank digital currencies are designed to be similar to cryptocurrencies, but they may not require blockchain technology or consensus mechanisms. Additionally, cryptocurrencies are unregulated and decentralized. Their value is dictated by investor sentiments, usage, and user interest. They are volatile assets more suited for speculation, which makes them unlikely candidates for use in a financial system that requires stability. CBDCs mirror the value of fiat currency and are designed for stability and safety. Central banks in many countries have launched pilot programs and research projects to determine the viability and usability of a CBDC in their economies. As of March 2024, three countries had a functioning CBDC: the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria. The Eastern Caribbean Currency Union halted its CBDC for technical reasons and started a new pilot program. There are 36 CBDC pilots in operation and 8 of the G20 have programs in development. The BRICS countries\u2014Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa\u2014are exploring a CBDC. One example of a failed CBDC attempt is the United Kingdom's Britcoin, which existed between 2011 and 2019. According to the Federal Reserve, the U.S. is one of those countries that is exploring whether a CBDC \"could improve on an already safe and efficient U.S. domestic payments system.\" CBDCs are government-backed digital currencies that use blockchain or distributed ledger technology. Their purpose is to expand accessibility to financial services and lower the maintenance costs of current monetary systems. Not yet. The Federal Reserve and its branches are researching CBDCs and ways to implement them in the U.S. financial system. President Joe Biden ordered the development of a national strategy on digital currencies. Yes, Jamaica, Nigeria, and The Bahamas have launched CBDCs. CBDCs should be implemented to enhance existing financial networks and fiat currencies, not replace them. If one was launched to replace a fiat currency, it might cause problems in a system\u2014but no country has tried it yet, so the effects it might have are unknown or theoretical at best. Many countries are researching or developing central bank digital currencies, and three have implemented them. A CBDC's main purpose is to provide businesses and consumers with privacy, transferability, convenience, accessibility, and financial security. Many individuals throughout the world have no access to bank accounts, so a CBDC would give them a way to be paid, hold their money, and pay bills. CBDCs could also decrease the maintenance a complex financial system requires, reduce cross-border transaction costs, and give people who use alternative money-transfer methods lower-cost options.

            "title": "Why Is Cryptocurrency Trading Popular In South Korea?",
            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Cryptocurrencies are popular investments among South Korea's younger generations. Generally, they view them as an alternative path to financial security due to a high youth unemployment rate, a way to feel more secure about their finances under political uncertainties, and because they are familiar with electronic payment systems. There are likely many reasons cryptocurrency is so popular in South Korea, but here are three of the most noteworthy. The first reason for the popularity of cryptocurrencies is the prevailing economic conditions in the country. Even though it is a prosperous one, the South Korean economy suffers from a youth unemployment problem. However, the key issue behind the youth unemployment rate is that there are more secondary and tertiary school graduates than there are jobs available. In a July survey by Statistics Korea, slightly less than 43% of South Koreans aged 15 to 29 not in education, employed, or in training (NEET), who responded \"yes\" to wanting to work couldn't find jobs that met their criteria for conditions and pay. Familiarity with micropayment transactions is another reason for the popularity of cryptocurrencies. South Koreans have long been early adopters of technological innovation, whether it is social networks or video games. It has some of the world\u2019s fastest Internet speeds and a well-developed telecommunication system to facilitate mobile payment systems. A robust gaming industry made South Koreans comfortable with electronic micropayments, an idea that has begun to take hold in the West. Businesses had cropped up around its games as well as black markets. The third reason for cryptocurrencies' popularity is political uncertainty. South Korea\u2019s neighbor, North Korea, has labeled its southern neighbor a hostile state, making its population uneasy about the country's stability and future. Because Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not attached to any state, they appeal to investors who are wary of North Korea\u2019s intentions. In March 2020, the South Korean National Assembly passed new legislation that paved the way for the regulation and legalization of cryptocurrencies and crypto exchanges. This action was taken in recognition of the burgeoning growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, even amid the COVID-19 epidemic. The legislation was designed to oversee an emerging industry and develop rules around anti-money laundering processes. South Korean investors were eager to invest in digital assets and cryptocurrency markets. According to 2021 survey data, 40.4% of 1,885 workers polled noted that they had invested in cryptocurrency. Remarkably, about 49.8% of South Korean workers aged 30 years to 39 years said they have invested in cryptocurrencies. Workers in their twenties followed with about 37.1%. The excitement shared by South Korean digital asset investors did not come without consequence\u2014as the excitement attracted the attention of criminals and regulators alike. Virtual asset service providers became regulated in 2021 after a March revision of the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information was implemented. This revision included requirements for listing virtual asset prices in fiat currency, real-name accounts, and other reporting requirements. South Korea's Virtual Asset User Protection Act took effect in July 2024. It lays out guidelines for publishing and enforcing decrees to protect traders from unfair and predatory trading practices. This act, combined with the earlier revisions to existing acts, provides more transparency and protection for South Korean investors. Cryptocurrency remains popular in South Korea, but North Korea's stance is not known as the state is very secretive. Yes. Cryptocurrency, while not considered money in South Korea, can be traded as an asset on exchanges. According to Chainalysis' Global Crypto Adoption Index, India has the most crypto exchange activity, followed by the U.S., Vietnam, and Pakistan. It's important to note that this activity may not all be from trading but from people accessing exchanges to use cryptocurrency in daily financial activities. A combination of political uncertainty, familiarity with micropayment systems, and economic problems have made cryptocurrencies an attractive option for South Korean investors. The country has always been an early adopter of key world-transforming technologies. It could be the case that the country may lead the way once again by incorporating cryptocurrencies into mainstream trading.

            "title": "GPU Usage in Cryptocurrency Mining",
            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. In 2009, Bitcoin became the first publicly-available proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency. At first, you could \"mine\" Bitcoins using just the central processing unit of home computers. The mining process became quickly competitive, and faster Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) were used. Clusters of GPUs were built into machines created only for mining, and were eventually replaced by the much faster and energy-gulping application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). However, tokens can still be mined on GPUs, but they are nowhere near as fast as ASICs. Read on to learn more about how GPUs were used in the blockchain space (and might be again). Cryptocurrency mining was originally performed only on home computers' central processing units (CPUs). However, CPUs cannot generate the immense number of hashes per second that GPUs can, so the mining programs were altered to use GPUs. GPU-based mining offered the benefit of processing simple instructions in parallel with more cores, which made them much more efficient than CPUs. GPUs are also equipped with a large number of Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU), which are responsible for performing mathematical computations (which is what hashing is). Courtesy of these ALUs, more cores, and parallel and single-task efficiency, GPUs are capable of performing more hashes than CPU, leading to improved output for crypto mining. Because a mining device continuously tries to generate a hash repeatedly by changing only one field in each attempt, mining is a simple task. CPUs are designed to handle general computing tasks and are faster (in megahertz and general processing speeds) than GPUs. Each standard computer is equipped with a Central Processing Unit (CPU). It performs the controlling functions for the whole computer based on the logic of the operating system and the software installed on the computer. Typical functions\u2014such as saving a file, printing a spreadsheet, or running non-graphic specific tasks\u2014are controlled by the CPU (unless the CPU has an integrated GPU, which is less powerful than dedicated GPUs). The GPU is another processing device, but one that works to render three-dimensional graphics and process many operations during a single cycle. The typical function of a GPU is to perform and control the rendering of visual effects and 3D graphics so\u00a0the CPU can focus on other tasks. It handles graphics-intensive tasks such as video editing, gaming display, and decoding and rendering 3D videos and animations. To draw an analogy using a business, a manager (the CPU) organizes and coordinates tasks for the whole organization (the computer system) and has a dedicated, specialized employee (the GPU) in a specific department (video-rendering functions). GPUs might still be useful in blockchain operations. Blockchain technology is being combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), and GPUs are much better at processing the kind of information and tasks that AI/ML requires. For example, in partnership with IPwe, IBM created an AI-enabled blockchain that tracks and secures patents globally. This approach allows businesses and individuals to prove and retain ownership of their intellectual property while enhancing its liquidity. GPUs are increasingly being designed to handle AI workloads, so it is inevitable that more applications and use cases will be created that combine blockchain, AI, and GPUs\u2014once again giving them a role in blockchains. If you mine 24 hours per day, your GPU will be under constant stress and will likely begin to slowly degrade, lasting only a few years even if you cool it properly. If you only mine occasionally for a few hours daily and keep it cool, your GPU should be fine for many years, depending on what else you use it for. However, GPU mining is not very profitable, so you might be wasting your time unless you enjoy it as a hobby. The popular and valuable minable tokens, regardless of developers' efforts, can be mined on ASICs, rendering GPUs obsolete for mining purposes. It depends on your GPU, the pool you join, and its payout scheme. It is unlikely that you'll earn more than a few dollars per day. even with a multi-GPU setup. At one time, GPUs were used to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that use a reward system to validate transactions and propose new blocks. However, they were replaced with ASICs once interest in profits overwhelmed the interest in an open-source and public payment system.

            "title": "Crypto Tourism",
            "content": "Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications. Crypto tourism is a form of tourism that caters to cryptocurrency enthusiasts by offering packaged travel tours that can either be paid for with digital currency or offer lectures or classes about cryptocurrency as part of the tour. Several tourism companies launched special, dedicated travel programs to cater to the needs of crypto and blockchain enthusiasts in 2018\u20132019. Most such travel programs include cruises, which offer a host of amenities dedicated to cryptocurrency participants. For instance, Blockchain Cruises, organized by the tourism arm of the Edinburgh, Scotland-based crypto wallet provider CoinsBank,\u00a0held four big crypto tourism cruises. Their most recent was in Europe in 2019. The cruise trip spanned five days and sailed in the Mediterranean. Approximately 2,500 participants attended. Then the travel industry, crypto tourism included, ground to a halt in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other forms of crypto tourism are simply travelers who use cryptocurrency to pay for their vacations. For example, before the pandemic hit, some tourist companies in Queensland, New Zealand, harnessed cryptocurrency to offer travel programs where tourists could use digital coins to experience the Southern Great Barrier Reef. In addition, countries like Grenada, Cyprus, and the Bahamas are all friendly toward tourists wanting to pay with digital money. The Bahamas was among the first countries to roll out its digital currency, called the Sand Dollar, in October 2020. The apparent target clients for such tours are the crypto-rich and famous. Still, plenty of regular folks interested in cryptocurrency may embark on a crypto tourism adventure or use cryptocurrency to pay for their holidays. Beyond the usual fun and sightseeing activities, crypto tours and cruises include conferences, exhibitions, and panel talks on cryptocurrency-related matters. The events have included prominent speakers who are considered industry stalwarts in the cryptocurrency and blockchain domain. For instance, the 2019 CoinsBank cruise hosted the crypto token proponent John McAfee, CoinsBank co-founder Vitaly Andrusevich, and noted investor and bitcoin cash supporter Roger Ver. In the past, a few such crypto tours were organized for specific purposes, like the promotion\u00a0of a promising initial coin offering (ICO). The programs included conferences, presentations, and market talks by promoters, industry leaders, and the like and aimed at audiences looking to make significant investments in cryptocurrency offerings. As more countries open their borders to travelers, Americans are planning to continue to use digital coins. Travala.com reports that 80% of users on its site are paying for their travel with crypto. When digital currency is allowed to be used to pay for holidays, it offers a new way for tourists to pay for their vacations. For would-be crypto investors, a tour geared toward learning about digital currency may be helpful by teaching travelers how to invest and navigate the crypto market. In addition, while the pool of participants in crypto tourism is small, it may grow in the future. Blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, is making inroads into the travel industry. However, a few red flags are\u00a0being raised about crypto tours and crypto tourism in general. With the cryptocurrency market already operating in a not-so-clear, unregulated manner globally, crypto tours are often accused of solely being used as a promotional medium to pitch ICOs and insignificant offerings to participants. It is also a small market for tourists, as most of the general public is not using digital currency, and investing in digital coins may be a limited group. Crypto tourism programs offer opportunities to learn more about investing in digital money Opportunities to meet with crypto experts during travel programs Crypto tourism may be used as a marketing tool Crypto tourism isn\u2019t a very large market in the travel industry The COVID-19 pandemic put crypto and other forms of tourism on hold. As the industry rebounds, there may be events in the future like the 2019 CoinsBank cruise, which hosted the crypto token proponent John McAfee, CoinsBank co-founder Vitaly Andrusevich, and noted investor and bitcoin cash supporter Roger Ver. The cruise on Oasis by the Seas by Royal Caribbean began in Barcelona and ended in Rome. And even while the high volatility in cryptocurrencies has raised concerns among investors, the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry continues to have its fans. In fact, a report from Travala.com, the \u201cworld\u2019s leading cryptocurrency-friendly online travel agency (OTA),\u201d found an increased desire from tourists to use cryptocurrencies to pay for their vacations. There are a couple of ways that crypto is used in tourism. It is used as a form of currency to pay for things like hotels, meals, and even airfare in some cases. Cryptocurrency is also used as a theme in tourist programs, such as a cruise offering expert lectures and classes given by digital currency experts. A crypto tourism cruise offers passengers access to lectures and workshops held by blockchain and digital currency experts. An example is the CBDC Cruise, scheduled for Nov. 16, 2024, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. There isn\u2019t \u201cblockchain tourism,\u201d but blockchain is used in the tourist and travel industry. Blockchain is a database often used in the cryptocurrency\u00a0market. The blockchain holds the data in blocks and chains them together. Blockchain enables cryptocurrency to occur, and this technology is impacting the travel industry by providing secure methods of payment and helping with managing multiple vendors and platforms. Pre-pandemic, there was a lot of buzz around the promising blockchain technology and the numerous crypto tourism offerings, but not all businesses and initiatives are successful. Crypto tourism programs are an emerging trend that attempts to serve as a platform for bringing together like-minded participants and promoting selected offerings. However, as countries begin to woo tourists back, cryptocurrency may continue to be an option for paying for a holiday. While such dedicated programs offer an opportunity to build a network among the still-nascent crypto community, the participants should practice due diligence before making their next big investments in the specialized sector. Investing in cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative.

            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are regulated businesses that facilitate cryptocurrency buying, selling, and trading. They act as an intermediary, attempting to provide a safe way to connect users to each other and as a way to exchange fiat and cryptocurrencies. The primary reason centralized cryptocurrency exchanges emerged is because, initially, cryptocurrency transactions were difficult to make. You needed to be familiar with the command line to use the programs, trust the person or entity you were transacting with, not make any mistakes while typing commands and long addresses, and much more. Investors became interested in the possibilities of returns and needed an easier and quicker way to buy and sell. Entrepreneurs, seeing an opportunity, created business models for exchanges that stored private keys and connected buyers and sellers. This distinguished them from decentralized exchanges, which are not run or controlled by a single entity. Rather, they are controlled by a community that has governance rights over the exchange, voting on the way the exchange runs or changes being proposed. Eventually, centralized exchanges began providing the same services that stock and commodities exchanges provide, which attracted the attention of regulators worldwide. Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are businesses. They operate for a profit while providing services that people demand or that make cryptocurrency transactions more simple. Some of the other elements that make a cryptocurrency exchange centralized are: The most obvious difference between centralized and decentralized exchanges is ownership. However, there are many more elements that make them different. Centralized exchanges can be used to conduct exchanges from fiat to cryptocurrency (or vice versa). Decentralized exchanges do not provide this service, only allowing crypto-to-crypto exchanges. Decentralized exchanges are often thought of as a \"trustless\" environment, functioning as peer-to-peer exchanges. Assets are never held by an escrow service, and transactions are done entirely based on smart contracts and atomic swaps and only between users. Centralized exchanges hold assets and conduct the exchanges for users, rather than users interacting directly with each other. Decentralized exchanges are generally also not regulated and are similar to traditional over-the-counter markets, which are also not regulated. It's common for a centralized exchange to offer cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency pairing. This allows customers to trade, for instance, bitcoin for ether. They also tend to offer fiat currency/cryptocurrency trading pairs, which allows cryptocurrency traders to take part in foreign exchange markets and other currency trading in addition to converting cryptocurrency to fiat. Some of the largest centralized cryptocurrency exchanges in the world offer these fiat/cryptocurrency pairs; however, they are regulated more heavily in some jurisdictions than others. Cryptocurrency is relatively new, and there are many horror stories about exchanges shutting down, being robbed, or being scams. Centralized exchanges are generally a much safer choice for people getting started in cryptocurrency; however, this is not always the case. FTX, one of the biggest centralized exchanges, shut down in late 2022 after it was discovered its owners were running a fraudulent operation. Billions of dollars in cryptocurrency were basically stolen from its users. The key lesson behind FTX's fraud and eventual failure is that even a centralized and regulated exchange can be risky for investors. But some exchanges have, so far, proven to be trustworthy, even though they have all had regulatory run-ins during their early years. Some of these exchanges include Coinbase, Robinhood, Kraken, Gemini, and Binance\u2014but by no means are there any guarantees that your cryptocurrency is 100% safe with them because of hacks, theft, and even employee issues. When choosing a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, make sure you understand its policies and how your money is protected. Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are businesses that offer cryptocurrency services such as fiat/crypto exchanges, trading pairs, and other buy and sell opportunities. Yes. Coinbase is a centralized exchange. It is also publicly traded on the stock market and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, FINRA, and other regulatory agencies in the U.S. It depends on who you ask. Most exchanges will tell you they are the most trusted, and users will have their own opinions. Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Robinhood, Gemini, and many others are used by millions of people, so they seem to have earned their trust. Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are online trading platforms that facilitate cryptocurrency exchanges between customers who prefer a familiar trading environment. These platforms are often used to store cryptocurrency and expose traders and investors to assets that are otherwise difficult for many people to access.

            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Phynart Studio / Getty Images Along with the explosion of interest in cryptocurrency, there is a growing need for clarity regarding the legal implications of these new currencies and the technologies that drive them. Regulatory agencies, tax authorities, and central banks around the world all are working to understand the nature and meaning of digital currencies. Meanwhile, individual investors can make a great deal of money, but they also assume certain legal risks when they buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Much of the murkiness surrounding cryptocurrency's legal standing is due to its newness relative to more traditional currency and payment systems, but regulations are slowly becoming more inclusive. One of the most critical legal considerations for a cryptocurrency investor has to do with the way that government tax authorities view cryptocurrency holdings. In the U.S., the IRS has defined cryptocurrencies as property rather than currencies. This means that individual investors are subject to capital gains tax laws when it comes to reporting cryptocurrency profits and expenses on their annual tax returns, regardless of where they purchased digital coins. Note that the above is true for investors who buy and sell cryptocurrencies. If you are an employee and are paid in cryptocurrency or receive it as payment for your services, it is taxable as income. The amount is based on the market value of the cryptocurrency at the time it was paid. IRS Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets is required for taxpayers with substantial assets in foreign accounts ($50,000 or more). However, as of November 2024, the IRS has not included cryptocurrency in its definition of specified foreign financial assets. This requirement should be closely watched for in the future, as it's possible the agency will decide to include it. Generally, if you hold assets in a reportable foreign financial account that total more than $10,000, you must file FinCEN Form 114, the Foreign Bank Asset Report. However, guidance from FinCEN remains unclear as to whether cryptocurrency is a reportable asset. A 2020 notice from FinCEN stated that virtual assets held in a reportable account with other reportable assets were required to be reported. It also stated that the Treasury was working on a rule to require virtual assets in foreign accounts reporting, but this notice and proposal were withdrawn in April 2024 for further analysis by FinCEN. This means FinCEN is still determining how to address international cryptocurrency holdings reporting. Further, it means that investors with cryptocurrency held in custodial accounts outside of the country must proactively discuss their tax situation with a tax attorney familiar with cryptocurrency foreign holdings. One of the great appeals of many digital currencies is also a potential risk factor for the individual investor. Cryptocurrencies, by definition, are decentralized, meaning that they have no physical presence and are not backed by a central authority. While governments around the world have stepped in to assert their regulatory power in various ways, BTC and other digital currencies like it remain unattached to any jurisdiction\u00a0or\u00a0institution. On one hand, this frees investors from being beholden to those institutions. On the other hand, this status could result in legal complications. The value of digital currencies is dependent entirely upon the value that other owners and investors ascribe to them; this is true across\u00a0all currencies, digital or fiat. Without a central authority backing the value of a digital currency, investors may be left without legal recourse should complications with transactions or ownership arise. Another potential risk associated with cryptocurrencies as a result of their decentralized status has to do with the particulars of transactions. In many transactions, currency with a physical presence changes hands. In the case of electronic transactions, a trusted financial institution is involved in creating and settling deposits and debt claims. Cryptocurrencies can be transferred using intermediaries which offer some protections, but peer-to-peer transactions remove any protections. Because of this fundamental difference,\u00a0legal confusion between parties in various types of digital currency transactions is a real possibility. Once again, because of the decentralized state of these currencies, the path of legal recourse in these situations can be difficult to assess. Cryptocurrencies provide criminal organizations and individuals another means of committing fraud and a host of other financial crimes. Investors may find themselves in the unfortunate position of being a victim of financial crime, and may not have the same legal options as traditional fraud victims. This issue also relates to the decentralized status of digital currencies. When a cryptocurrency exchange is hacked and customers' holdings are stolen, for instance, standard practices for discovering where the missing funds went have been developed. Addresses can be identified, and messages sent to them, but unless the thieves inadvertently identify themselves or send the funds back, there is usually no way to recover them. Most regulated exchanges carry crime insurance that covers investors' holdings if their internal systems are hacked, but if a theft occurs because a user's exchange account or personal wallet was hacked, there is often no recourse. Digital currency investors thus take on a certain amount of risk\u00a0by purchasing and holding cryptocurrency assets. The legal risks for cryptocurrency investors in the U.S. include improperly reporting taxes, regulatory changes, and different legal treatments in separate jurisdictions. Decentralized exchanges are not regulated, which can cause issues for investors because they have no recourse if theft or fraud occurs. Even centralized exchanges are not 100% safe, as client funds and information can be misused or kept unsecured. The most significant cryptocurrency risk is its price volatility. Because its market value is tied directly to investor sentiments, it is subject to very wide price swings. Large gains are possible, but so are large losses. Regulatory changes within and differences across jurisdictions make up the most significant regulatory risks. As of November 2024, the U.S. is still ironing out which agencies have specific jurisdiction and is working on reporting requirements. Developers and startups related to digital currency have focused a great deal of attention on\u00a0creating secure means of holding digital coins and tokens and mitigating the risks users and investors inherit. Cryptocurrency exchanges are always working to improve their security measures, but investors in some areas have not been able to mitigate all of the legal risks associated with owning cryptocurrencies.

            "title": "Who Is Ross Ulbricht?",
            "content": "Ross Ulbricht is the imprisoned founder of Silk Road, the darknet marketplace Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Ross Ulbricht is\u00a0a former darknet market operator most famous for\u00a0creating and running the Silk Road market. He was arrested in 2013, and two years later a Manhattan federal jury found him guilty on seven charges including conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy to commit computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic narcotics through the internet, and continuing a criminal enterprise, the kingpin charge. Ulbricht used the pseudonym \"Dread Pirate Roberts\" and was sentenced to life in federal prison in 2015. Investopedia / Ellen Lindner Ulbricht grew up near\u00a0Austin, Texas, studying physics at the University of Texas at Dallas and then enrolled at Pennsylvania State University to pursue a master's program in materials science.Ulbricht founded Silk Road in 2011, calling himself \"Dread Pirate Roberts\" online. He envisioned the site as a \"means to abolish the use of coercion and aggression amongst mankind,\" according to his LinkedIn page. Ulbricht was \"creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.\" By adopting encryption and cryptocurrency, the marketplace provided anonymity and security for its participants, using Tor encryption and Bitcoin. \"Silk Road\" became popular over a short period. When numerous media outlets picked up stories on the market in mid-2011, interest grew, and traffic increased exponentially. Silk Road remained a shrouded marketplace where legal and highly unlawful activity occurred through 2013. The site was used by over 100,000 users who bought and sold $200 million worth of illegal goods and services. Ulbricht, a first-time offender, did not sell illegal drugs and other items but created and operated a site where others did. The FBI investigated site users, eventually identifying Ulbricht as the founder and owner of Silk Road. Ulbricht was arrested and the FBI seized his laptop on October 1, 2013. The Silk Road website generated over $13 million worth of Bitcoin in commissions. The FBI seized 144,336 bitcoins from a shared digital wallet on Ulbricht's laptop. They were sold in a series of auctions generating proceeds worth $48.2 million. Ross Ulbricht was convicted on all seven counts in February 2015. The trial was a highly publicized and charged event, with the presiding judge reportedly receiving death threats from presumed Silk Road supporters, although that was never proven. Before his sentencing, Ulbricht stated, in a letter provided to the\u00a0judge, that his actions were linked to\u00a0his libertarian ideals and that \"Silk Road was supposed to be about giving people the freedom to make their own choices.\" On May 29, 2015, Ulbricht was sentenced to two life imprisonment terms plus 40 years to be served concurrently. On Sept. 23, 2013, the Silk Road home page advertised 13,000 listings for controlled substances, listed under such categories as \u201cCannabis,\u201d \u201cDissociatives,\u201d \u201cEcstasy,\u201d \u201cIntoxicants,\u201d \u201cOpioids,\u201d \u201cPrecursors,\u201d \u201cPrescription,\u201d \u201cPsychedelics,\u201d and \u201cStimulants.\" Ulbricht attempted to appeal, and in May 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied his attempt. Also in 2017, Ulbricht appealed to the Supreme Court, with attorneys arguing that his case involves unresolved constitutional questions regarding the Fourth Amendment and the digital age. In June 2018, the court declined to hear Ross\u2019s case. In late 2020, national media reported that former President Donald Trump was considering commuting Mr. Ulbricht's sentence, but ultimately he did not.Since Ulbricht's incarceration, more than 570,000 have signed an online petition created by Lyn Ulbricht, Ross' mother, to commute his double life sentence. On May 29, 2015, Ulbricht was sentenced to two life imprisonment terms, plus 40 years, to be served concurrently without the possibility of parole. While darknet sites were early adopters of Bitcoin, Ross Ulbricht did not develop any cryptocurrency. The FBI shut down Silk Road shortly after Ross Ulbricht's arrest, seizing 144,336 bitcoins. Ross Ulbricht is infamous for creating and running the Silk Road market and a federal jury found him guilty on seven charges, including conspiracy to traffic narcotics. He was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison.

            "title": "Digital Money: What It Is, How It Works, Types, and Examples",
            "content": "Investopedia / Joules Garcia Digital money is any means of payment that exists in a purely electronic form. Digital money is not physically tangible, like a dollar bill or a coin. It is accounted for and transferred using online systems. Digital money generally represents fiat currencies, such as dollars or euros.\u00a0It is exchanged using computers, smartphones, cards, and online cryptocurrency exchanges. In some cases, it can be converted into physical cash using an ATM. Digital money is similar in concept and use to its cash counterpart in that it can be a unit of account and a medium for daily transactions\u2014it is treated the same as cash. For example, the dollars in your bank account are digital\u2014banks no longer store physical cash for clients. When you make a cash deposit to a bank, it adds numbers to your account and reissues those bills to other customers. If you make a cash withdrawal, the bank converts your digital dollars to cash, subtracts the amount from your account, and gives you physical bills. This makes financial transactions much faster and cheaper, especially concerning cross-border payments and remittances. Given these advantages, digital money has become a priority for several governments around the world. For example, the central bank of Sweden, a country that has been researching a cashless society, has released several exploratory papers since 2017 that explore the benefits and drawbacks of introducing digital money into its economy. China released the digital renminbi (e-CNY), the digital equivalent of its national currency, and began using it to pay government employees; the Bahamian sand dollar was introduced in 2020. Digital money makes it easier for central banks to implement monetary policy because they don't need to collect and store physical money or assets to influence inflation or create financial system stability. Several systems already perform transactions with digital versions of money. For example, credit card systems let you purchase goods and services on credit. Wire transfer systems enable the movement of cash across borders. Such transactions are expensive and time-consuming because they involve disparate processing systems. The SWIFT system, a payments systems network consisting of various banks and financial institutions across the globe, is an example\u2014each transfer conducted through the SWIFT network has an associated charge. SWIFT member institutions also function in a patchwork of regulations, each specific to a different financial jurisdiction. Moreover, these systems are built on the promise of future payments, ensuring a time lag for each transaction. For example, reconciliation for credit cards occurs at a later date, and users can file chargebacks for transactions. One of the aims of digital money is to do away with the time lag and operating costs inherent in current systems by using distributed ledger technology (DLT). In a distributed ledger system, shared ledgers are connected via a common network to record transactions. Entities across jurisdictions can connect, which minimizes processing times. It also provides transparency to authorities and stakeholders. Because the ledger is stored on multiple machines, it is difficult to alter them, especially if they are secured through cryptographic techniques. One of the key advancements in DLT systems is historically linked encryption methods that chain blocks together (called a blockchain). Blockchains improve the resiliency of a financial network because they make it very difficult to change records or access them. A blockchain with a decentralized and distributed validation mechanism also solves the double-spending problem, where a digital asset can be spent more than once because there is no physical transfer. When there is an extensive network of automated validators checking encrypted transactions linked by historical information, double-spending is not possible. A large and powerful network is orders of magnitude faster than individual computers or small groups, which cannot keep up with the processing rates of the bigger networks. This speed makes a network uneconomical and exceedingly hard to hack. Third parties can be eliminated in transactions using blockchains and distributed ledgers; blind signatures hide transacting parties' identities; zero-knowledge proofs encrypt transaction details, and encryption adds extra security. Examples of this type of digital money are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Thanks to its technological underpinning, digital money can be adapted to suit multiple purposes and can take on various forms. Besides the digital representation of cash currently used, there are a few more\u2014and it is likely more will emerge. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are currencies issued by a country's central bank. They are separate from fiat currencies, backed by the authority and credit of a central bank, and are another obligation of the institution. CBDCs are newborns when it comes to digital money. Some countries have implemented them, but many remain vigilantly observant, waiting to see how the idea works out in the countries experimenting with them. There are even suggestions for different types of CBDCs. For instance, a type called a wholesale CBDC could be used in transactions between banks and financial institutions for wholesale payments\u2014large or high-value payments between institutions. Retail CBDCs could be designed for daily transactions by consumers and businesses, much like fiat currencies. Cryptocurrencies are a digital currency designed using cryptography. They are more commonly becoming known as virtual currencies, a subclass of digital currencies, in an effort to distinguish them from officially recognized money. The crypto wrapper around a digital currency provides enhanced security and makes transactions tamper-resistant. Since 2017, the popularity of cryptocurrencies as an investment class has skyrocketed the market capitalization of crypto markets. By November 2021, the market cap of cryptocurrencies had surpassed $2.7 trillion. The crypto winter of 2022 saw the total crypto market cap drop under $1 trillion, but it began recovering in 2023, climbing to more than $2.5 trillion in March 2024. Stablecoins are a variation of cryptocurrencies and were developed to counter the price volatility of regular cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins can be likened to a form of private money whose price is tied to that of a fiat currency or a basket of goods to ensure that they remain stable. They can be a proxy for fiat currencies, except they are not backed by governmental authority. The market for stablecoins has exploded in recent times. As of January 2024, 168 stablecoins were listed on CoinMarketCap, the popular cryptocurrency data aggregator, some of which were not showing activity. The current financial infrastructure is a complex system of many entities. Conducting transactions between financial institutions takes time and money because they work in different technological systems and regulation regimes. The main advantage of digital money is that it speeds up transaction speeds and cuts back on costs. Other advantages of digital money are as follows: The disadvantages of digital money are as follows: Digital wallets serve as the cornerstone of the digital money ecosystem. Digital wallets are the primary interface where users interact with and manage their digital currencies. They provide a secure environment for storing and managing digital money. A fundamental aspect of digital wallets is their role in facilitating transactions (obviously involving digital money). Users send and receive payments via their digital wallets by interacting with software interfaces. Consider how you've sent money to a friend via popular banking or personal finance applications; these applications may have digital wallets or similar technologies that facilitate transmitting funds. One of the key advantages of digital wallets is their accessibility and mobility. Users have instant access to their digital money anytime, anywhere, as long as they have an internet connection. This mobility empowers users to make transactions on-the-go using their smartphones or other internet-enabled devices. This concept is one of the primary benefits of cryptocurrency: anyone around the world can have access to banking services which otherwise have been restricted in many areas of the world. Last, security is paramount in the realm of digital money. If it's really easy to move money, it's easy for others to move your money if they get access to your account. Digital wallets may include encryption techniques, multi-factor authentication, and biometric authentication methods to safeguard digital assets. Digital money (or digital currency) refers to any means of payment that exists purely in electronic form. Digital money does not have a physical and tangible form, such as a dollar bill or a coin, and is accounted for and transferred using online systems. Its technological underpinnings mean digital money can be adapted for various purposes. Apart from being a digital representation of fiat currency, there are other forms of digital money, such as central bank digital currencies and stablecoins. Cryptocurrency is a form of digital money that is built on blockchain networks that rely on cryptography. There are other forms of digital money aside from cryptocurrency. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are digital currencies backed by a government and regulated by its agencies. There has been discussion about a digital dollar for several years, but it seems unlikely to happen in the U.S. soon. Digital money is a major innovation in financial technology. It overcomes the issues created by cash and makes payment systems faster and cheaper. But it has the attendant dilemmas technology introduces, as digital money can be hacked and erode privacy. While digital money is still in its early days, it will play an important part in the future of finance.

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. A crypto regulatory sandbox is a live-like testing environment used to ensure regulatory compliance and security checks for financial operations, including cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks.  A sandbox is a commonly used term in the field of software development. A sandbox refers to an isolated\u2014but fully functional\u2014testing environment where\u00a0software, applications (apps), and programs can be tested. If a programmer writes a new piece of code, they may use a sandbox to test it. For example, if a programmer working on updating the Uber ride-sharing app adds a new feature to more accurately locate the passenger using GPS, or a team of developers at Facebook enhances the site's functionality, before such updates and features are launched, they may be tested in an isolated and controlled\u00a0environment called the sandbox. Regulatory sandboxes involve a coordinated effort to create and improve existing regulations for a particular industry by working with all of the regulatory agencies and companies involved in that industry. Regulatory sandboxes can help companies understand the regulatory requirements in a country. Sandboxes can also be used in the early stages of writing regulations when there isn't an existing framework in place. In other words, regulations can be tested in an environment to determine how best to regulate a particular industry and build a network of cooperation from the regulated companies. Some sandboxes can be broad in nature\u2014a focus on the financial services sector\u2014while other sandboxes can be more targeted. Targeted sandboxes can include creating testing environments for improving payment systems and developing digital authentication to prevent fraud, system hacking, and cyber attacks. Beyond testing\u00a0features and functionality, a sandbox also allows security aspects of new code to be verified. Regulatory sandboxes have also been used to test blockchain technology and how to effectively introduce and implement cryptocurrencies within a financial system. Blockchain is a distributed-ledger system similar to a shared database in which financial transactions are verified before being added to the publicly-viewed ledger as a permanent record. Transactions in a blockchain must be approved and validated by its participants and once a transaction has been completed, a new block is added to the network. Although blockchain technology is typically used as a shared ledger for public use, private blockchains can also be created, which would only allow access for certain participants that meet the authentication requirements. The interest in blockchain technology by governments and regulators is on the rise. For example, in 2018, the European Commission announced that more than 21 member states of the European Union signed a declaration creating the European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) to develop the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI). The blockchain initiative is designed to provide access to digital public services such as regulatory reporting, energy, and logistics to benefit companies and citizens. Sandboxes can help regulators learn about new technologies, such as financial technologies (or fintech), which offer financial products online and through mobile devices. Many banks and financial technology firms are using digital products to improve their customer's experience. The digitization of financial services includes the following services: Although fintech is usually reserved for the banking sector, other industries such as education and government agencies have used the technology to facilitate electronic payments. However, since the financial sector is heavily regulated by securities and banking laws in many countries, regulatory compliance is a must. The functions that come under compliance scrutiny include monetary transactions, lending, payments, insurance, and trading processed through straight-through processing (STP) technology. Regulatory authorities must balance digital innovation and consumer protections, which is why regulators in many nations have adopted a \u201cregulatory sandbox\u201d based\u00a0approach. The use of a regulatory sandbox allows authorized businesses to test their innovative products, services, business models, and delivery mechanisms in the real market, with real consumers, on a trial basis. It helps reduce\u00a0the time to market at a low cost, improves access to capital, and ensures adherence to compliance requirements. Such regulatory sandboxes allow room for direct communication between fintech developers and businesses and regulatory officials while mitigating the risks of unintended negative consequences such as security flaws. As blockchain technology and various cryptocurrencies have gained\u00a0popularity, adherence to regulations and the security of digital assets is gaining importance. Repeated incidents of cryptocurrency thefts, hacking attempts, and scams are also acting as a deterrent to mass adoption. Regulatory sandboxes have been\u00a0extended into the virtual world of cryptocurrencies, where\u00a0financial regulators are offering authorized businesses the possibility of testing blockchain\u00a0products. For instance, in August 2021, the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) gave\u00a020 companies access to its regulatory sandbox service. In early 2023, the European Commission launched its own sandbox. The sandbox comprises of a diverse set of expert professionals including law firm Bird & Bird, consulting firm OXYGY, web designer Spindox, and blockchain expert WBNoDE. The European Blockchain Regulatory Sandbox will operate for 3 years with three annual cohorts of 20 use cases each, and the most innovative regulator participating in the sandbox will be awarded a prize. In the U.S., Mick Mulvaney,\u00a0the former acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), in September 2018 announced the launch of a regulatory sandbox aimed to encourage cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. In early 2020, before he dropped out of the presidential race, then-candidate Michael Bloomberg called for a \"fintech sandbox\" to promote innovation. In November of 2020, the government of Spain signed into law the Digital Transformation of the Financial Sector, which created a sandbox for the cryptocurrency and fintech ecosystem.\u00a0As the sandbox and the subsequent regulations develop, it could lead to the further widespread use of cryptocurrencies in the country and act as a model for the rest of the European Union nations. Spain is already at the forefront when it comes to offering cryptocurrencies since the country bolsters 285 Bitcoin ATMs. Regulatory sandboxes typically have a limited duration and may only cover specific aspects of the cryptocurrency and fintech industry. This limited scope can hinder the comprehensive testing of innovative solutions, potentially leaving out critical use cases or technologies. For example, the European Blockchain Regulatory Sandbox has a term life of only three years and will trial run no more than 60 use cases over its lifetime. Due to the innovated and exploratory nature of these sandboxes, it's often difficult to set specific timeframes, goals, or milestones to achieve. For instance, the Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN) was created in 2019 as a pilot project to test regulation on 44 applications. When reporting on the expected timeline to review these applications, Baker McKenzie state it \"is difficult to give a precise figure due to the limited time the GFIN has been running.\" Last, there are political and geographical constraints of crypto regulatory sandboxes. Consider how political bodies are confined to their physical regions, while cryptocurrencies can be exchanged and traded around the world. This interoperability of crypto poses many regulatory challenges, and sandboxes are often confined to a country's borders related to a specific region's challenges. As noted by Stanford University, \"the scope of fintech sandboxes rarely goes beyond the relatively narrow national level. Consequently, there are still no harmonized international legal standards on the legal frameworks governing sandboxes.\" It's likely that an increasing number of crypto sandboxes are to be adopted in the coming years as more companies and governments explore the potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. However, the findings from the existing sandboxes have yet to be finalized and implemented. Cryptos have had their fair share of challenges, including hacks in which money was stolen, such as the Ethereum hack in 2016 in which $50 million dollars was stolen. The disagreement on how to handle the hack led to the split of the network into two blockchains: Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). It's important to note that even though investment in blockchain technology has increased, it doesn't necessarily mean that the cryptocurrencies that are commonly traded today will be used within those networks. For example,\u00a0the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) has developed a sandbox exploring the use of blockchain technology for payments within the banking sector. UBS has partnered with other large banks throughout the world to develop a Utility Settlement Coin (USC), which is a digital equivalent of cash. The USC would be converted on a one-to-one basis or parity with a corresponding fiat currency, such as the euro or U.S. dollar, and backed by cash at a central bank. Companies benefit from participating in a regulatory sandbox by gaining the opportunity to test their cryptocurrency and blockchain projects in a real-market environment, receive feedback from regulators, and identify and address regulatory challenges before a full-scale launch. According to CoinDesk, the European Union has turned its attention to the metaverse, forms of digital cooperation, and decentralized automated organizations. These virtual worlds, which often have their own virtual currencies, \"bring unprecedented opportunities in many societal areas\" but \"also involves new forms of global governance.\" Yes, regulatory sandboxes typically have predefined time limitations, allowing participants to test their projects under relaxed regulations for a specific period, after which they must comply with standard regulations. SAND is the native token for The Sandbox, an immersive 3D metaverse game on the Ethereum blockchain. Users of The Sandbox can explore, purchase land, and monetize assets on the blockchain. The Sandbox is not associated with nor reflects an actual cryptocurrency regulatory sandbox. Crypto regulatory sandboxes are controlled environments established by government agencies to enable fintech companies and startups to test cryptocurrency and blockchain projects under relaxed regulations. They aim to foster innovation, identify regulatory challenges, promote innovation, and protect consumers.

She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Cryptocurrency futures are contracts between two investors who bet on a cryptocurrency's future price, giving them exposure to cryptocurrencies without purchasing them. Crypto futures resemble standard futures contracts because they allow traders to bet on the price trajectory of an underlying asset. These contracts specify that one party must deliver a cryptocurrency's fiat value to another party at a specific price by a certain date. Crypto futures contracts trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and cryptocurrency exchanges. Margined futures for Bitcoin and Ether also trade on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). The first Bitcoin futures contracts were listed on the CBOE in early December 2017, but were discontinued. In January 2024, the exchange announced that margined\u00a0Bitcoin\u00a0and Ether futures began trading. According to the exchange, this made it the \"first U.S. regulated\u00a0crypto\u00a0native exchange and clearinghouse to offer both spot and leveraged derivatives trading on a single platform.\" The CME introduced Bitcoin futures contracts in December 2017. The contracts are traded on the Globex electronic trading platform and are settled in cash. Bitcoin and Ether futures are based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate and the CME CF Ether Reference Rate. The CME also has reference rates for many other cryptocurrencies, although futures for these cryptos are not available on the exchange for trading. These rates are published for traders using other exchanges. There are 17 cryptocurrency rates (including bitcoin and ether), four DeFi token rates, and three Metaverse token rates. The table below highlights the contract details for Bitcoin and ETH futures offered by the CME: According to data from crypto aggregation site CoinGecko, some prominent crypto derivative trading platforms are: Consider the following example for a CME Group Bitcoin futures contract. Suppose an investor purchases two Bitcoin futures contracts totaling 10 bitcoin. The price of a single bitcoin when the futures contract was purchased was $5,000 each, totaling $50,000 for both futures contracts. The exchange calls for a 50% margin for Bitcoin (60% for Ether) futures trading, so they would need to place $25,000 in their margin account. The rest could be funded by leverage. Brokerages offer futures products from many companies but can have different margin requirements over and above the amount the provider charges. For example, CME has a base margin requirement for Bitcoin futures; brokerages like TD Ameritrade, which offers CME Bitcoin futures trading as part of their product suite, can set margin rates on top of the base rate set by the exchange. The contract's value varies based on the underlying asset's price (i.e., Bitcoin). CME uses the Bitcoin Reference Rate, which is the volume-weighted average price for Bitcoin sourced from multiple exchanges and is calculated daily between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. London time. To trade futures, you must have an account with a registered futures commission merchant or introducing broker. Depending on Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations, you can either hold onto the futures contracts or sell them to another party. At the end of your contracts\u2019 duration, you have the option to roll them over to new ones or let them expire and collect the cash settlement due. The steps to conduct a trade in Bitcoin futures are the same as those for a regular futures contract. You begin by setting up an account with the brokerage or exchange where you plan to trade. Once your account is approved, you will need another approval from the trading service provider to start futures trading. Generally, the latter approval is a function of funding requirements and the account holder\u2019s experience with derivatives trading. The same criteria also play an essential role in determining leverage and margin amounts for your trade. Futures trading makes heavy use of leverage to execute trades. Government agencies regulate the maximum leverage amount allowed at regulated exchanges and trading venues. Bitcoin\u2019s risky and volatile nature means that the margin amounts required for trading their futures are generally higher than those for other commodities and assets. The story is different at unregulated exchanges. They have the freedom to allow excessive risk-taking for their trades. For example, Binance offered leverage of up to 125 times the trading amount when it launched futures trading on its platform in 2019. That figure was revised to 20 times the trading amount in July 2021. Remember that higher leverage amounts translate to more volatility for your trade. Thus, the promise of high profits is offset by the risk of losing significant amounts of money. The amount you can trade depends on the margin amount available to you. Margin is the minimum collateral you must have in your account to execute trades. The higher the amount of the trade, the greater the margin amount required by the broker or exchange to complete the trade. You can also gain exposure to cryptocurrency futures by trading cryptocurrency ETFs. There are several Bitcoin ETFs that are linked to Bitcoin futures. The main advantage of trading Bitcoin futures contracts is that they offer regulated exposure to cryptocurrencies. That is a significant point in a volatile ecosystem with wild price swings. In the U.S., bitcoin futures contracts at CME are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This offers a measure of confidence and recourse to institutional investors, who compose the majority of traders in such contracts. The further out the futures contract expiration date is, the higher the account maintenance amount will generally be. The number of venues offering cryptocurrency futures trading is growing, as are the numbers of participants and trading volumes compared to other commodities. Cryptocurrency futures trading has its own set of peculiarities. Trading volumes in cryptocurrency futures can mimic those of its spot markets counterparts. Price fluctuations can also be high, especially during volatile stretches regarding price. During these times, cryptocurrency futures may appear to follow spot market prices or trade at a significant premium or discount to spot prices. This means that Bitcoin futures may not offer sufficient protection against the volatility of the underlying futures market. The SEC warned investors about the pitfalls of trading cryptocurrency futures in June 2021. \"Among other things, investors should understand that [bitcoin], including gaining exposure through the [bitcoin] futures market, is a highly speculative investment.\" Except for select trading venues, such as CME, cryptocurrency futures trading occurs mainly on exchanges outside the purview of regulation. Among the world\u2019s biggest platforms for Bitcoin futures, only CME is regulated by the CFTC. Cryptocurrency options are a relatively new development. CME introduced trading in Bitcoin options in January 2020 and Ether futures options in September 2022. Cryptocurrency options work like standard options contracts because they are a right, not an obligation, to buy cryptocurrency at a set price on a future date. The asset is represented by cryptocurrency futures contracts traded at the CME, with a single options contract equivalent to a single futures contract consisting of 5 BTC or 50 ETH.\u00a0Options contracts for six consecutive months are available at a time at CME. They expire monthly on set dates, with two additional December contract months. Traders can buy call options if they think the price of Bitcoin will go up. Alternatively, a put option is a bearish bet that the cryptocurrency\u2019s price will decline. The gains and losses in both cases are different. In a call option, gains may be unlimited (because the price can go up indefinitely), while the losses are limited to the premium paid for the contract. In a put option, losses may be unlimited (because the price may go down to zero), while the gains are limited to the premium paid for the options contract. Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility makes it a risky asset for options trading. The implied volatility of options contracts is high, meaning that the price of a single Bitcoin option is also high. High prices can magnify trader losses. Cryptocurrency futures and options are the same as options on other investments. They are bought and sold to allow traders the option to exercise a cryptocurrency futures contract. Yes. You can trade cryptocurrency futures and options with brokers such as Interactive Brokers, Edge Clear, Ironbeam, or TradeStation. While bitcoin has the most trading volume and the largest market cap, other cryptocurrencies can also be traded. You can trade futures in ether, Binance Coin, Solana, XRP, and more on many exchanges. Cryptocurrency futures are contracts based on underlying cryptocurrency prices that allow traders access to price fluctuations without taking possession of cryptocurrencies. These futures reduce the risk of buying actual cryptocurrency because you're buying and selling bets on what you believe their prices are going to do.

NurPhoto/Getty Images Convertible virtual currency is a digital currency that can be used as a substitute for real and legally recognized currency, even though it does not have legal tender status. Convertible virtual currency is a digital currency that can be used as a substitute for real and legally recognized currency even though it does not have legal tender status. Convertible digital currencies can be exchanged for fiat currencies on exchanges and used as a store of value or payment method in addition to the uses they were created for.  Convertible virtual currencies and fiat currencies can be exchanged for each other. They tend to have an exchange rate based on supply and demand. Convertible virtual currencies contrast with non-convertible currencies (or closed virtual currencies) that are not used in external commerce or directly exchangeable for other currencies, such as virtual currency contained within a video game environment. Convertible virtual currency is an example of how technological advances are driving disruptive changes in the traditional way of doing things across the globe. This is especially true of the way goods and services are paid for and acquired. Virtual currency is defined by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)\u2014a bureau of the U.S. Treasury\u2014as \"a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency.\" A convertible virtual currency usually has a measurable value in real money, but what makes it convertible lies in its ability to be exchangeable. Not all virtual currency can be exchanged for legal tender; therefore, not all virtual currency is convertible. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\u00a0defines a convertible virtual currency as one that has a value in real currency. For the IRS, bitcoin, ether, and similar currencies are convertible virtual currencies. Another feature of convertible virtual currencies that makes them similar to state-backed currencies is their tax liability, at least in the U.S. \"The sale or other exchange of virtual currencies, or the use of virtual currencies to pay for goods or services, or holding virtual currencies as an investment, generally has tax consequences.\" The nature of convertible virtual currencies makes them susceptible to use as vehicles for money laundering, tax evasion, and terrorist financing. This has led some countries to propose regulatory measures for how currencies will be observed and used for tax purposes. In the U.S., FinCen guidelines rule that virtual currency that can be exchanged for legally recognized money is property, not money, and will be treated as such. Tax principles that apply to property transactions, therefore, apply to these types of currencies. For example, a taxpayer who receives bitcoin in exchange for goods and services has to record the fair value of the virtual currency in U.S. dollars as of the date it was received. This value is included in computing the taxpayer's annual gross income. In addition, a virtual currency is also regarded as a capital asset depending on how long it has been held and is thus subject to tax on its capital gains or losses. So, if you received one bitcoin as payment for services, you'd need to report any income generated from that sale as income that year on your taxes. If you didn't spend that bitcoin for more than one year and its market value increased during that time, you'd also owe capital gains taxes on the gain when you cashed it in. The most popular form of virtual currency remains Bitcoin. Bitcoin runs on a decentralized peer-to-peer network that employs blockchain technology to prevent fraud and control the money supply. Bitcoin is a convertible virtual currency because it can be exchanged for real money based on its determinable market value. The value of a Bitcoin in dollars has ranged from as low as a few cents to an all-time high of more than $73,000 in March 2024. Other popular virtual currencies are ether and XRP. Virtual currency can be converted for cash through online exchanges or brokers. Exchanges such as Coinbase and Bitstamp, which Robinhood announced it would acquire, allow users to exchange their bitcoins for their local currency. The Bitcoin holder makes a sell order like they would if making a trade with a securities broker. The \"sell\" order includes the number of Bitcoins and the price per coin. The user's account is credited in the local currency when their order is matched to a corresponding \"buy\" order. Bitcoin can also be exchanged for real currency using Bitcoin ATMs, which are only available in select countries. In some circumstances, closed virtual currencies are considered convertible virtual currencies. Linden dollars is a closed virtual currency that is solely used in a virtual world called Second Life. Second Life is a social game with a virtual economy where players buy and sell goods using Linden dollars. Players convert their real money (e.g., euros) into Linden dollars at the game's official currency exchange site known as LindeX. Like a traditional exchange platform, market and limit buy and sell orders are conducted among the players. As of June 2021, $319 Linden dollars will buy 1 U.S. dollar. FinCEN rules about virtual currencies recognized Linden dollars as a convertible virtual currency in 2013. Bitcoin, ether, and XRP are examples of convertible virtual currencies. Convertible virtual currency mixing is the practice of using several virtual currencies to hide a monetary source, destination, and amount. FinCen proposed a rule in October 2023 to make the practice illegal because it is similar to money laundering. Ethereum is the blockchain network and ecosystem with a native token, ether. Ether is a convertible virtual currency. Convertible virtual currencies are digital assets that can be bought with and exchanged for fiat currency. They are generally, but not always, cryptocurrencies or other digital assets with a monetary or market value and can be used as payments for goods and services.

            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical function used in cryptography. Typical hash functions take inputs of variable lengths to return outputs of a fixed length. A cryptographic hash function combines the message-passing capabilities of hash functions with security properties. Hash functions are commonly used data structures in computing systems for tasks such as checking the integrity of messages and authenticating information. While they are considered cryptographically \"weak\" because they can be solved in polynomial time, they are not easily decipherable. Cryptographic hash functions add security features to typical hash functions, making it more difficult to detect the contents of a message or information about recipients and senders. In particular, cryptographic hash functions exhibit these three properties: The three properties outlined above are desirable but cannot always be implemented in practice. Cryptographic hash functions are widely used in cryptocurrencies to pass transaction information anonymously. For example, Bitcoin, the original and largest cryptocurrency, uses the\u00a0SHA-256 cryptographic hash function in its algorithm. Ethereum, the second most popular blockchain, uses Keccak-256 to hash information. However, hashes have other applications in the real world. These are some of the most common cryptographic applications: Storing passwords in a regular text file is dangerous, so nearly all sites store passwords as hashes. When a user inputs their password, it is hashed, and the result is compared to the list of hashed values stored on the company's servers. However, this is not a fool-proof practice\u2014hackers have created databases of common passwords and their hashes, called rainbow tables, which make it easier for them to get into accounts. Verifying signatures is a mathematical process used to verify the authenticity of digital documents or messages. A valid digital signature, where the prerequisites are satisfied, gives its receiver strong proof that a known sender created the message and that it was not altered in transit. A digital signature scheme typically consists of three algorithms: a key generation algorithm; a signing algorithm that, given a message and a private key, produces a signature; and a signature verifying algorithm. Hashes can ensure messages and files transmitted from sender to receiver are not tampered with during transit. The practice builds a \"chain of trust.\" For example, a user might publish a hashed version of their data and the key so that recipients can compare the hash value they compute to the published value to make sure they align. The best cryptographic hash function is the one that meets the needs of whatever it is being used for. SHA 256 is one of the most used, but there are many to choose from. An example of a hash function is MD5, used for encoding sensitive information. Here is the previous sentence in an MD5 hash: d13718d1f2b95ae65888a57fd5bc0056 The three properties a hash function should have are collision resistance, preimage resistance, and second preimage resistance. Cryptographic hash functions are programs that use a mathematical function, like an algorithm, to convert information to a hexadecimal form. These functions are also used in cryptocurrency to secure blockchain information. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

            "title": "What Is a Cryptocurrency Public Ledger? How It Works and Risks",
            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. A cryptocurrency public ledger is a distributed record-keeping system used to record cryptocurrency transactions. Because anyone can participate, they generally use cryptography in their programming to secure the ledger, but the transactions are publicly viewable. This article explores\u00a0cryptocurrency public ledgers, how they work, and the challenges faced by developers and users. A cryptocurrency is a decentralized cryptographic token that can be transferred between network participants, facilitating the exchange of value. The public ledger is used to maintain participants' identities, balances, and transactions in a secure and pseudo-anonymous form by automatically: Generally, a user initiates a transfer to another party through an interface or by issuing a command. The blockchain verifies the sender's public and private keys, and the recipient is given a new private key. The transaction is recorded on the blockchain in a file and becomes part of an automatic verification process. Cryptocurrency public ledgers are more commonly called blockchains because they depend on chaining files called blocks together using cryptography. Each blockchain is programmed differently, but in general, transactions are recorded in files called blocks. These blocks contain several transactions, time stamps, and other data sent through encryption algorithms. Most blockchains send specific information from the block through a hashing algorithm (the cryptography mentioned earlier) and include the resulting hexadecimal number\u2014called a hash\u2014in the following block. The next block includes that hash, creating the secured information chain. This progressive hashing builds a long chain of files that cannot be altered as long as there is enough participation. Unless the blockchain is programmed to obscure information, transactions, the hash, and user addresses remain viewable. Most blockchains allow one node to add a proposed block to the chain through different mechanisms. Some randomly select specific nodes or receive votes from others to produce blocks. Others use a competitive hashing mechanic. There is no particular way blocks must be produced\u2014it is up to the imaginations of the developers and community to determine how they want the ledger network to generate and validate blocks. Transactions are usually automatically verified before a block is created by blockchain programming; users who do not have the appropriate amount of tokens cannot make transactions. Nodes assemble blocks through various techniques\u2014most use a memory pool (mem pool) that stores unconfirmed transactions. These transactions tend to be sorted by how much a user paid to the nodes (via a tipping or variable fee mechanic) and are processed in that order. Nodes place transactions in the block they are proposing, hash the information that requires it, and broadcast it to the rest of the nodes on the network. Through various validation processes (called consensus mechanisms), the network usually reaches an agreement on the block's validity by comparing hashes. This works because any change in a block's information produces a different hash, so nodes should all generate identical hashes from one block's data. The most popular consensus mechanisms are proof-of-work and proof-of-stake, but there are others like delegated proof-of-stake, proof-of-history, proof-of-activity, and more. All these different mechanisms attempt to address many of the issues public ledgers face, with varying results. These consensus mechanisms generally include a network's validating nodes using the same information the proposed block includes to generate a hash. If a majority of the network creates hashes from this information that match that of the proposed block, it is accepted. If the majority creates blocks that don't match, the proposed block is rejected, and the network moves to the next block. Because a cryptocurrency's public ledger is public, the transaction details can be queried and verified by anyone. This makes the system more transparent than traditional banking systems and methods without disclosing personal information. Additionally, these ledgers cannot be altered by anyone, given enough network participation. Traditional banking requires trust in people\u2014and most people are honest and well-meaning; however, the trust placed in financial institutions has been proven to be misplaced because they are money-making businesses that employ people, and people can be corrupted. Cryptocurrency public ledgers remove the need to trust people because they are automated and (in most cases) do not exist to earn profits. Despite public ledgers' advantages, there are concerns\u00a0about\u00a0their use for payment systems intended to be global in scale. Scalability, decentralization, and security must all be enhanced, but to enhance one, another must be sacrificed. Some public ledger projects claim to have solved this trilemma, but most that make this claim have not gained enough traction or adoption to offer enough proof. The way blockchains work mandates that every single transaction that has ever occurred on the network is recorded. The more transactions that occur, the larger the blockchain grows. This means that participants must continually increase the amount of storage they provide, or developers must find ways to reduce the storage burden. The capacity to process the growing number of transactions is generally the most significant scalability issue. Many blockchains, even the most popular ones, cannot match the speed of current payment systems. Developers are working on this, but as more people participate, transaction fees increase and processing times decrease. For cryptocurrency public ledgers to be secure, large networks or more advanced techniques are required to maintain security. Proof-of-work blockchains that do not have enough participation can be taken over by entities with enough hashing power to propose blocks and make changes. Blockchains that use proof-of-stake can require large amounts of financial collateral to allow participants to create blocks and earn fees, theoretically centralizing the blockchain. Thus, the most significant security issue is that it must be incentivized\u2014without incentives, it's likely there won't be as much participation, which reduces security. A public ledger is generally available for anyone to use, while a private ledger is reserved for specific individuals or entities. Cryptocurrency ledgers are generally public because cryptocurrencies are designed to be used by anyone. Private ledgers, by current definitions, don't usually have cryptocurrencies, but they may have tokens that can be used by participants. The simplest method is to use a blockchain explorer website like BTC.com or Blockchain.com to view block information. If you're more technically inclined, you can use a program called a block parser. As a data storage container, the public ledger forms the backbone of a cryptocurrency by automating transactions, verification, and information storage. While its uses are becoming more mainstream, configuring a public ledger with the correct parameters is essential to maintaining decentralized, scalable, secure, and anonymous features, but it is proving to be challenging for blockchain developers.

            "title": "Cryptocurrency Airdrop: What Is It and How Does It Work",
            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Investopedia / Joules Garcia A cryptocurrency airdrop is a marketing strategy that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses. Small amounts of the new virtual currency are sent to the wallets of active members of the blockchain community for free or in return for a small service, such as retweeting a post sent by the company issuing the currency. The ultimate goal of a crypto airdrop is to promote awareness and circulation of a new token or coin. A crypto airdrop is a promotional activity typically performed by blockchain-based startups to help bootstrap a virtual currency project. Its aim is to spread awareness about the cryptocurrency project and to get more people trading in it when it lists on an exchange as an initial coin offering (ICO). Airdrops are generally promoted on the company's website, social media, and cryptocurrency forums. Coins or tokens are sent only to specific wallets based on the blockchain network or coins held in existing wallets. To qualify for the free gift, a recipient may need\u00a0to hold a minimum quantity of the crypto coins in their wallet. Alternatively, they may need to perform a certain task, such as posting about the currency on a social media forum, connecting with a particular member of the blockchain project, or writing a blog post. Cryptocurrency airdrops are aptly named in reference to physical airdrops using aircraft. Airdrops using aircraft entail the delivery of resources (such as weapons, food, or medicine) that physically drop out of the sky. In a standard crypto airdrop, participants interested in receiving an airdrop simply express their interest in order to receive the airdrop. The individual must provide a valid wallet address, and some airdrops require no additional information beyond this. Standard airdrops often have a set amount of tokens to distribute with a limit on how many tokens each individual may receive. Therefore, some standard airdrops are time-sensitive. Though these types of airdrops are popular due to their simplicity, there is nothing stopping a single user from creating multiple wallets to quickly drain the airdrop amount, so these may be more difficult to obtain. Bounty crypto airdrops occur when users perform certain tasks. These tasks often entail raising awareness of a project by posting on social media and tagging the company or retweeting a recent tweet about the project. There may also be referral bonuses or finder's fees for individuals who recruit other users, sign up for the project's newsletter, or join the company's Discord channel. In exchange for performing tasks, users often receive points that correspond to how large of bounty airdrop they receive. Users may also be required to earn a certain amount of points before they qualify for their airdrop. For example, a user may be eligible for an airdrop after earning 300 points with each item mentioned above is worth 100 points each. Holder crypto airdrops occur automatically based on who is holding existing tokens and how many tokens they hold. Because wallets and blockchain information are part of a publicly distributed ledger, all users of blockchain have full transparency into the wallets and distribution of tokens. The downside to holder airdrops is individuals who may be holding tokens may not want an airdrop. Alternatively, holder airdrops ensure that only the largest, most invested individuals receive the benefit. Some holder airdrops may only award an airdrop if members are holding a certain amount of tokens; otherwise, they may pro-rate the award amount. A more specific type of holder airdrop, an exclusive crypto airdrop occurs when specific people are individually selected for the airdrop. The difference is they may be selected not based on the amount of tokens they have but based on other elements such as time spent on a project, most money spent on non-token activity, or number of posts in a forum. An exclusive airdrop is an even more centralized way of rewarding those closest to the project and may give airdrops to wallets that may not hold any tokens at all. Some of the types of airdrops above may be combined with a raffle airdrop. Often, a project will state the number of airdrops they intend to give and encourage individuals to earn a raffle ticket. This ticket may be earned by holding tokens, earning points, or simply expressing interest. Ultimately, the number of individuals interested in the airdrop often exceeds the number of airdrops the company wishes to deliver. Therefore, a raffle occurs and a limited number of wallets are randomly selected to receive the airdrop. Never share your private keys with individuals you do not know or trust. The crypto airdrop process begins by the project or company deciding the need for an airdrop. This may be in response to market strategies, a hard fork in the network, or to incentivize existing investors. The initial step is to select how the airdrop will be facilitated and who is eligible. The next step for broad, general airdrops is to launch the public campaign. This includes collecting information for interested parties; this is often limited to just wallet addresses, though companies may also gather e-mail addresses to grow their contact list. Other types of airdrops may rely on a snapshot, a capture of an instance that identifies who possesses certain criteria. For example, the project may perform a snapshot to identify all addresses that held at least 1,000 tokens as of midnight on December 31st. Any transactions occurring after the snapshot will not impact the results of the airdrop; therefore, coin or token prices often experience volatility in response to when snapshots are taken. Once the list of airdrop recipients is selected, the airdrop is facilitated often through the use of smart contracts. The company may choose to use their Treasury wallet to facilitate the airdrop, and the company often publicizes the transaction block to demonstrate the equitability of the airdrop. The transaction will show the airdrop leaving the company's wallet and distributing to the recipients. Airdrop recipients often directly receive the coins or tokens without having to accept the tokens. Some may need to add the token or coin along with its address to their wallet to appropriately view their wallet balance of the token. A legitimate crypto airdrop never seeks capital investment in the currency. Its aim is purely promotional. On other hand, some crypto scams involve sending micro amounts of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to unsuspecting recipients in what is known as a dusting scam. Many airdrop scams rely on directing an investor to attach their wallet to a phishing website in order to claim their airdrop. Often, the web3 address will prompt a user to connect their wallet using common and popular wallet services such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Oasis. After a user connects their wallet by providing their secret phrase or keys, the scam is complete. Airdrop scams may also occur by enticing market participants to invest in a specific security in hopes of being airdropped a different item. For example, a project may boast that holding certain NFTs in a wallet will cause owners to receive a rare airdrop. Though the airdrop may be legitimate, the project owners may have enticed market activity of the NFT so they could sell theirs at a higher price. Users should always be vigilant about unsolicited deposits into their crypto wallets. In addition, users should be aware of the projects they are investing in or attempting to claim assets for. The common phrase among cryptocurrency explorers is to \"do your own research\". It's advised that crypto-enthusiasts not connect to websites they are not familiar with. This includes ensuring external links they click on come directly from the project. Consider bookmarking common sites you plan on visiting frequently to ensure you're always connecting to the right site. Companies often publicly communicate airdrops and other promotions. Consider following the project on social media, forums, or Discord to follow upcoming events, and be mindful that complex scams may replicate or imitate project social media profiles. If you don't want airdrops associated with primary investments, consider creating a new wallet specific to airdrops. After receiving the tokens, you can then transfer the tokens to different wallets. Though not a form of traditional diversification, keeping crypto in different wallets does spread and reduce overall risk. Cryptocurrency transactions\u2014including airdrops\u2014have evolved, complex tax legislation that requires care and consider. If you are unsure about the taxable status of a crypto transaction, consult a tax professional. Whether or not an airdrop counts as a taxable event depends on the jurisdiction of where the token holder is living in. In the United States, crypto airdrops are considered income as part of one's Federal income tax return. The difficulty of reporting taxes on an airdrop is the token may not yet have liquidity or an easily assessable fair market value. An airdrop should be recognized as income at its fair value when it is received. In addition, airdrops are not considered taxable income until an individual has control over the token. If the airdrop is locked or on a vesting schedule, it is not taxable income until it is received and can be traded. Should the price of the airdrop drop after receipt and then later sold, this transaction creates a second, unrelated transaction that occurs in a capital loss. The taxpayer would recognize income for the amount of the airdrop, then recognize a loss equal to the different between the airdrop price and sale price. If the price should appreciate, a short-term or long-term gain may be taxed based on the holding period. Given the extreme competition among cryptocurrency startups, an airdrop is an attempt to stand out from the crowd. Some businesses devoted to crypto airdrops offer alerts to users and listing services to startups, plus a range of marketing services to fine-tune their airdrops. As always, there are good businesses and bad in this space. Michael J. Casey, Chair of CoinDesk's advisory board and an advisor at MIT's blockchain research initiative, argued in a post on a CoinDesk blog that some type of marketing is essential if a cryptocurrency is to succeed. \"A currency is nothing if it is not widely used. And that can't be achieved unless people make some cost-incurring effort to encourage widespread usage,\" he wrote. Certain crypto airdrops also have the advantage of rewarding loyal patrons of specific blockchain networks. In addition, sending airdrops to all wallet or existing token holders widely distributes tokens in a manner that may not happen naturally in an open market. However, there are several issues to consider in regard to crypto airdrops. The obvious concern is network safety, especially the nature of \"redeeming\" airdrops. For example, some airdrops may claim users must connect their wallet to suspicious websites; once the connection to web3 is made, the thief may now have access to the user's keys or password. Crypto airdrops may also not be legitimate projects. Though enticing due to the nature of receiving free money, some projects lure stakeholders into increasing the stake of their airdrop by buying more tokens. Ultimately, the long-term goal may be to \"rug pull\" investors by dumping large amounts of tokens into the marketplace at once, crashing the price and making prior airdrops worthless. Airdrops may be seen by some as low-quality projects. Some may prefer to instead focus on rewarding miners or other contributors of a network instead of releasing free tokens to non-heavy contributors of a project. Last, since airdrops may lack liquidity, airdrops may literally be worthless if they can not be traded on an open exchange. Often the result of the infancy of a project, airdrops may claim to have a value of thousands of dollars. However, without the ability to openly trade the airdropped tokens, the free gift to wallet holders may prove to be worthless. Rewards early adopters or people engaged with a project with a stake in the project Raises awareness of a project due to the marketing aspect of an airdrop Encourages the use and adoption of a newly issued token May distribute tokens across holders in a manner that would not have naturally happened in an open market May pose security threats if wallet holders must connect wallets to suspicious sites to claim airdrop May prove to be \"pump-and-dump\" schemes May dissuade some investors from participating if they prefer different ways of distributing tokens May prove to be worthless if the token does not have liquidity on an exchange Crypto airdrops and initial coin offerings may appear to be very similar. Both are likely to occur at the start of a project, and both are intended to distribute coins or tokens. Crypto airdrops may not require an investment, while initial coin offerings often require a transaction. Though the transaction may reward investors by offering coins or tokens at a discount, it is expected that investors buy the coins or tokens as opposed to airdrops which are free. ICOs are often initially offered first to venture capitalists. In addition, the demographic for these two events are largely different. ICOs attempt to attract larger investors who are willing to infuse capital into a project. These users are more likely to pursue the project as an investment. Alternatively, airdrops are often intended to raise awareness among smaller users. Though users may not have much use for a small airdrop, the goal is to entice smaller users to transact with the digital currency. At the end of 2021, Gas DAO was formed to distribute tokens to individuals who had paid a certain threshold of Ethereum gas fees. The concept was ownership of the DAO would be tied to the largest users of Ethereum. 55% of Gas DAO tokens were airdropped to 634,429 eligible wallets. Also at the end of 2021, the OpenDao distributed tokens to NFT holders based on OpenSea trading activity. Ownership of OpenDao tokens would be airdropped based on NFT-ownership, forming an entity structure driven by the most ambitious collectors. At it's peak, OpenDao had a market cap of greater than $250 million. As of September 2022, its market cap had dropped to less than $11 million. The first cryptocurrency airdrop is attributed to AuroraCoin (AUR) on March 25, 2014. Intended to be the cryptocurrency for the nation of Iceland, every citizen or permanent resident who submitted their national ID received 31.8 AUR. Similar to other types of crypto airdrops, an NFT airdrop credits NFT holders with additional tokens. This is done to build a stronger community around certain NFTs, create buzz, and reward NFT holders. Yes. To encourage Bitcoin adoption as the country expanded its legal tender to Bitcoins, El Salvador credited everyone who installed the government-built wallet with $30 worth of BTC. Crypto airdrops are often communicated and marketed to the general public to raise excitement and awareness regarding a token. Many of these airdrops can be found by subscribing to airdrop newsletters or following blockchains on social media. Individuals can make money from crypto airdrops, though crypto airdrops are intended to increase use of a cryptocurrency across a broad range of users. For that reason, airdrops are often not substantial amounts (less than $10), and the tokens may not be liquid. Also, there is higher risk that users will try to liquidate their holdings when they are able to (thus quickly dropping the value of the coins or tokens). Crypto airdrops are a way for companies and projects to raise awareness of their token or coin. It is also a way to increase the liquidity of their security by giving it away to thousands of different wallets. Though airdrops have value and may be considered free money, there are also significant risks if users are not aware of potential scams related to crypto airdrops. Investing in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Jessica Olah / Investopedia Cardano (ADA) is a decentralized Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain designed to be more efficient than blockchains that rely on Proof-of-Work (PoW). Similar to Ethereum, Cardano's PoS consensus mechanism uses and rewards cryptocurrency for work done to review and expand the historical blockchain record. Cardano is intended to evolve into a system for decentralized applications (dApps) with multiple use cases governed by stakers. The blockchain's cryptocurrency token is named ADA after Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, an English aristocrat commonly regarded as the first computer programmer. ADA can also be purchased on most major cryptocurrency wallets and cryptocurrency exchanges. Charles Hoskinson, an Ethereum co-founder who left the project due to disagreements with the direction of Ethereum, began developing Cardano in 2015 and launched the blockchain network with the first mined block in 2017. Cardano considers itself an updated version of and has positioned itself as an alternative to Ethereum, anointing itself a \u201cthird-generation\u201d platform compared with Ethereum\u2019s \u201csecond-generation\u201d credentials. Cardano has a self-proclaimed goal of providing banking services to the world\u2019s unbanked. An eponymous non-profit foundation, the Cardano Foundation, was established in 2017 to oversee the development of the Cardano blockchain and to promote its adoption. Prior to that, IOHK, an engineering company, was the primary developer of the Cardano blockchain. Throughout its history, the Cardano blockchain has undergone four notable hard forks in its history: the Shelley, Alonzo, Vasil, and Valentine hard forks. The Shelley hard fork transitioned Cardano from a federated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (fBFT) consensus mechanism to a more decentralized PoS consensus mechanism called Ouroboros. The Alonzo hard fork enabled smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain for the first time, opening up the possibility for a wide range of dApps to be built on Cardano. The Vasil hard fork brought scalability upgrades to further improve dApp functionality, such as increased block size, improved transaction processing, and new scripting capabilities. In February 2023, the Valentine upgrade occurred, causing another (planned) hard fork. The purpose of this update was to allow more efficient cross-chain applications to be built and add support for other protocols. Both the Cardano and Ethereum blockchain platforms are used for responsive applications and aim to build a connected system similar to the Apple and Android store, but decentralized. The most prominent features offered by Cardano and Ethereum to support dApps are their use of smart contracts and a PoS blockchain algorithm. Cardano had a staking mechanism long before Ethereum did, but it only recently supported smart contracts. Cardano implemented smart contract support in 2021 with its Alonzo update. This update took place on Cardano's test network, a beta version of the blockchain, and was the first iteration of bringing promised scalability and interoperability to users. Smart contracts allowed Cardano developers to create dApps such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and manage multiple cryptocurrency assets associated with these dApps. Future releases and forks of Cardano are expected to formally bring smart contract capabilities to the main network, the official version of the blockchain. Cardano uses a PoS consensus mechanism, in which users \"stake\" the blockchain's cryptocurrency for the opportunity to become a validator. A stake is a pledge of a certain amount of ADA cryptocurrency to represent and secure validator rights in the Cardano network. ADA cannot be used or spent while it is staked because it must be held as collateral to incentivize honest validation behavior. Validators open and finalize blocks of transactions and are rewarded with ADA from other validators based on the number of tokens they have staked. Users can participate in the validation process by creating or joining a pool, which can be public or private. Staking pools consist of one or more trusted server nodes that conduct the work of validating transactions, updating the ledger, opening new blocks, and earning rewards. Public pools distribute rewards to members based on how much Ada they have staked. Private pools, as the name suggests, give rewards to their sole owners. A Cardano staking pool must be run by an operator with the technical knowledge and skills to maintain the stake pool by renting servers, monitoring the node, holding the pool key, and conducting other pool administration tasks. Bitcoin was developed as a peer-to-peer payment system, while Cardano is focused on fostering a general blockchain ecosystem that allows developers to create other tokens, dApps, or any uses a scalable blockchain network can host. The Cardano platform's PoS consensus mechanism relies on staking to validate transactions and reward cryptocurrency to validators, whereas Bitcoin's PoW relies on cryptocurrency mining. Cardano's PoS expends drastically less energy than Bitcoin's PoW by removing the need to have computers gobbling up large amounts of electricity to power complex mining calculations. Cardano's PoS consensus mechanism also makes its validation process more accessible to the average user than Bitcoin's PoW. Cardano staking can be done simply by installing compatible wallet software on computers or devices\u2014Bitcoin mining can also be done this way, but it is not very efficient, even if it is done through a pool, which is the least commitment-intensive option for mining. Cardano is designed to be developed in \u201ceras\u201d named after notable figures in poetry and computer science history: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. Basho, Cardano's current era, is focused on bringing scaling and optimization capabilities to Cardano. As of April 2024, Cardano is anticipating the transition from Basho to Voltaire. Voltaire, Cardano's final era of development, is intended to bring voting and treasury management to the blockchain network through particular smart contract functionalities and system improvements. As with all blockchains and cryptocurrency projects, it is difficult to say how long they will last. Cardano is still being developed and maintained, so it appears that it still has potential, at least in the short term. It depends on your outlook, risk tolerance, and investing strategy. Cardano's all time high was about $3.16 on Sep. 2, 2021. Cardano is a decentralized PoS blockchain founded in 2015 and launched in 2017. It has positioned itself as an alternative to PoW blockchains like Bitcoin because it is more energy-efficient and scalable. The plans behind Cardano\u2019s development are ambitious. Its developers see Cardano as eventually becoming fully decentralized when voting and treasury management of blockchain are added to its capabilities in the future.

            "title": "Hot Wallet vs. Cold Wallet: What\u2019s the Difference?",
            "content": "d3sign / Getty Images Hot wallets are cryptocurrency wallets with a connection to the internet; cold wallets do not have a connection. Both are means for storing cryptocurrency and token private keys. It\u2019s necessary to know the differences between a hot wallet and a cold wallet so that you can store your cryptocurrency private key safely. Hot wallets are software that stores your private keys on a device connected to the internet. They offer a series of features, from storing, sending, and receiving tokens to managing and viewing all your available tokens in one place. Hot wallets are accessible from internet-enabled devices such as cellular phones, tablets, and laptops. They have been widely adopted by cryptocurrency users because they are an interface that makes it easier to transfer and receive cryptocurrency. Cold wallets differ from hot wallets in that they don't have a connection to another device or the internet. Hence, they\u2019re less susceptible to hacking. This makes them a popular method for storing crypto keys. These wallets usually come as hardware devices that look like USB sticks and cost between $50 and $200. Hardware and paper wallets are examples of cold storage wallets. An added security layer stems from the fact that the private keys in cold wallets are entirely offline\u2014compared with those of hot wallets\u2014and must be transferred to a hot wallet to complete a crypto exchange. Hot wallets come in different types and have various purposes. Some are mobile applications, web-only wallets, or even ecosystem-specific wallets. The list is extensive, and wallet usage depends on a user\u2019s needs. Some of the more common hot wallets include: Other reasons you might choose a specific hot wallet type include design, fees, and even integration with certain crypto exchanges. It is essential to research wallets to find the best one for an activity. Cold wallets are available in different types; some of the more common examples include: Hardware wallets are not always cold wallets, so make sure you don't assume one is before purchasing it. There are two key components in a cryptocurrency wallet: the private and public keys. These keys are made up of a string of letters and numbers. The way a crypto wallet works is straightforward: The public key is your wallet's address. You can think of public keys as similar to a bank account number, where transactions are sent to and from. The wallet holds the private keys to your cryptocurrencies after purchasing or mining them. When a cryptocurrency transaction needs to be completed, private keys are required. Private keys are designed to verify the ownership of a token. Without them, you can\u2019t use your cryptocurrency. Think of them as the passwords you need to complete a crypto transaction. Coinbase offers a hot wallet for users and custodial cold storage for customers who are not comfortable storing their keys. As far as being hacked through a connection to the internet, yes. However, cold wallets can be lost, stolen, or damaged. Some \"cold\" wallets have Bluetooth or wireless connections that can accidentally be left on, require software to be installed on a device, and even have apps you need to install. The more convenient a storage method is and the more features it has, the less secure it is. The primary advantage is that a cold wallet keeps someone from remotely stealing your keys because there is (or should be) no connection. Hot and cold crypto wallets each come with specific advantages. However, it\u2019s a good practice to use both types of wallets by moving the keys you don't need immediately to your cold wallet. It\u2019s best to do some research before deciding on a crypto wallet type. That way, you\u2019ll be set up for an optimum experience when storing and trading your digital assets.

            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. It\u2019s almost impossible to avoid frequent headlines declaring that Bitcoin or some other new cryptocurrency is the gold standard of the new world of digital assets.\u00a0Nobody wants to miss out on a gold rush, but Bitcoin isn\u2019t gold, and neither are its rivals.\u00a0However, just as with gold mining, crypto mining involves expending energy to\u00a0acquire something that, depending on the coin\u2019s inflation schedule, may have finite availability. In early 2024, there were more than 9,000 active cryptocurrencies.\u00a0What may be surprising is that in a 2022 study by Investopedia regarding financial literacy, 49% of adults, when asked how well they understood crypto, said they were \u201cbeginners.\u201d Where does this leave the individual who believes in the future of these crypto assets but can\u2019t figure out how to invest in them? A modern financial advisor who is well-versed in crypto can help you make sense of this relatively new landscape. There is no consensus (pun intended) on whether crypto is gambling or investing. It seems it can fill both roles, depending on who is buying it, how informed they are, and their strategy behind the purchase. Financial advisors are more likely to tell you it resembles gambling, but investors who have experienced growth using crypto might claim differently. However, even among investment advisors who like alternative assets that tend to move independently of the S&P 500 Index, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find many willing to suggest putting a chunk of your portfolio into any of the cryptocurrencies. Most wealth managers are steering clients clear of crypto for two reasons, listed below. Some advisors might not view cryptocurrency as an asset, something most of their clients should stay away from unless they have money that they can afford to lose\u2014and don't mind losing. Cryptocurrencies may be thrilling to watch, but an advisor could put their client in a bad position by recommending placing money in a new financial product without any real understanding of how it works\u2014this really is gambling. Although\u00a0an advisor may be deeply knowledgeable about\u00a0crypto, the advisor may not provide any recommendations on whether to buy or sell any digital currency. The advisor is not alone in this way of thinking. The reason is that an advisor\u2019s job is not to sell transactions but rather to manage their clients\u2019 money and expectations. Wanting to protect advisory clients, sometimes from themselves, the advisor screens out the noise in the market and steers them away from the many cryptocurrency scams that have cropped up.\u00a0To put that in perspective, crypto scammers stole some $10 billion in 2021 and $5.9 billion in 2022. Crypto scams and crime are dropping, but millions of dollars in cryptocurrency are still being stolen. Many clients ask how they can invest in crypto because they\u2019ve heard how much money they could make.\u00a0The problem with this thinking is that\u00a0cryptocurrencies are so volatile that investing in them while the volatility continues is essentially gambling. A better way to think about cryptocurrencies is to focus on the technology behind them: the blockchain. The blockchain is more or less a distributed ledger. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency because it was the first viable one and has the highest market cap. Blockchain technology was originally developed with payment processing in mind, but in reality, there are a lot of truly solid potential uses for it. Some possibilities include digital identity, data tokenization, data management,\u00a0and secure audit trails. Be sure to keep track of your cryptocurrency passwords. If you lose them or don\u2019t leave them to your heirs, no one can access the tokens you\u2019ve acquired. As of December 2022, advisors are free to talk to their clients about cryptocurrencies. However, the influential Certified Financial Planner (CFP) Board of Standards urged any CFPs considering offering advice on cryptocurrency-related assets to do so cautiously. In a Nov. 30, 2022 notice, which will have been closely read by CFPs and the wider financial advisor community, the entity responsible for overseeing professional standards stated that cryptocurrencies should be treated with greater scrutiny than more conventional financial assets as they \u201chave particular attributes and present significant risks and uncertainties that warrant careful analysis.\u201d Among other things, the CFP Board noted that cryptocurrency-related assets are generally: The CFP Board mentioned that this update had been planned for a while, and interestingly, alongside laying out the risks, it chose to remind CFP professionals that they are not required or obligated in any way to provide financial advice about cryptocurrency-related assets. It\u2019s likely that the CFP Board is aware that an increasing number of CFPs are asked by their clients about these types of investments and wanted to remind them to be extra careful before giving in to these requests. In the end, this notice didn\u2019t result in any rule changes for CFPs. However, it clarified the risks of crypto assets and possibly made financial advisors even more cautious about advising clients on these types of investments. In an ideal world, you would turn to your financial advisor,\u00a0ask about adding some cryptocurrencies to your portfolio, and\u00a0discuss which ones and how much. In the real world,\u00a0most advisors don't even recognize them as an investable asset class and don't bother researching or analyzing them. Therefore, many are not able to talk about them. So, where can you go for real advice about investing in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency you're considering? You can always fall back on the less-than-5% rule, a simple guideline that dictates not putting more than 5% of your portfolio into any high-risk category. Even then, at this point, you'll have to get a little creative in your quest for crypto investments\u00a0if you're working with most financial advisors. However, there is more than one way to participate in cryptocurrencies, and not all of them involve buying the digital assets directly. Some knowledgeable advisors would rather take one of these indirect approaches instead of actually helping you own cryptocurrency. Your financial advisor might go for one or more of the following alternatives: Remember, like betting on a horse race, the amount of money you\u2019re willing to risk on cryptocurrencies should be limited to the amount you can afford to lose. Of course, the high level of risk associated with crypto assets doesn\u2019t automatically mean that they\u2019re gambling and not an investment. There are plenty of so-called \u201creal\u201d assets that come with loads of risk as well. Still, if cryptocurrencies do take their place among conventional investments, then advisors\u00a0will have to catch up with those who waded into the fray long before them. If you\u2019ve spent time studying blockchain technology and want to invest in it for what it is\u2014instead of speculating and hoping for the best\u2014you may have to do the heavy lifting and buy the cryptocurrency yourself. To do so, you need a digital wallet to store your cryptocurrency keys securely. To\u00a0convert any cryptocurrency\u00a0into\u00a0cash, look for an exchange that supports trading the currency you want to purchase, such as San Francisco-based Coinbase, one of the more well-known exchanges. This digital currency exchange lets you buy and sell\u00a0Bitcoin, Ethereum,\u00a0and other crypto products in your local currency. Not all digital exchanges support all cryptocurrencies and/or all fiat currencies\u00a0(the technical term for dollars, euros, yen, and other government-issued currencies). Start with well-known names such as Coinbase, Kraken, or Gemini, and do your homework before investing any cash. However, even the best crypto exchanges are not entirely without a blemish. Examine each exchange\u2019s history of freezing and closing accounts, outages, and close ties with some traditional banking establishments. Most importantly, look for an exchange that offers insurance coverage for any losses that are its fault. To buy or sell cryptocurrencies, you only need to log into your account on the selected exchange, either in its mobile app or on its website. For maximum security,\u00a0you may want to set up your own cryptocurrency wallet to hold the currency rather than use\u00a0one provided through the site. Before starting, you\u2019ll want to learn the safest ways to store your bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A crypto advisor is an asset manager who understands the workings of cryptocurrency and the appropriate ways to invest in it. As professionals who stay abreast of the rapid developments in cryptocurrency and blockchain, crypto advisors may be registered as investment advisors, registered representatives, or hold a credential like Certified Financial Planner (CFP) or Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA). As of January 2024, no \u201cofficial\u201d way to be licensed as a professional cryptocurrency advisor exists. However, most U.S. states are requiring that businesses retailing cryptocurrencies get licensed as a money transmitter business (MTB). Crypto retailers fit this definition, requiring licensing from the states and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Individuals are not required to get licensed to work at an MTB. Cryptocurrencies could be a good investment for those who believe in the future of digital currencies and those who wish to protect themselves in the online financial arena. Cryptocurrencies are also relatively immune to political manipulation. Finally, of course, if you have spare assets with which you want to speculate, then crypto is a great place to do it. Some advisors will list crypto on their website, but there is always the chance that they listed it strictly for marketing purposes. Feel free to ask them probing questions about blockchain or Bitcoin and see if they can engage in intelligent discussion. Some advisors wishing to be well-versed in crypto might pursue the Certified Digital Asset Advisor designation. The rhetoric in this article will likely be adjusted continuously as the crypto landscape is still unfolding. New coins are added daily, and the once-niche concept of blockchain is gaining real-world traction and government attention. It is becoming ever more important for financial advisors to understand the asset class, yet many are hesitant to do so, and even more will not recommend it. This makes finding an advisor well-versed in crypto difficult, but not impossible. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

Learn the various ways to invest in Web 3.0 EDUARD MUZHEVSKYI / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY / Getty Images The internet has connected the world in more ways than any other technology. With people getting more concerned about their data and privacy, however, the internet in its current state seems inadequate. There are serious concerns over how big companies handle and monetize user data, creating the need for a better or alternative internet. Web 3.0 is an alternative that is becoming popular because it puts the internet's power back into the hands of end users. We\u2019ve answered common questions around Web 3.0 investments in this guide, in a way any beginner investor can understand. Web 3.0 offers investors different investment vehicles that can cater to different risk appetites. Nevertheless, just like every form of investment, investing in Web3 is risky and should only be done with adequate research and a good strategy. The most common Web3 investment options are stocks, cryptos, and NFTs. However, there are also less popular investment methods you can consider, such as angel investing or buying into the IDO (Initial DEX Offering) or ICO (Initial Coin Offering) of a crypto company. In both methods, you invest in a company by participating in a seed round or buying its coin before launch. One thing to note is that most of Web3 investing is based on narratives: investors spreading the word on what a company is doing to grow the Web3 ecosystem. However, you shouldn\u2019t depend on narratives when making decisions.That\u2019s because some Web3 influencers push a good narrative about a project to get people to buy into the project, and then they end up dumping the project. Instead, focus on investments with a reasonable historic performance, like these three options. Stocks are one of the easiest ways to get into Web3, especially as they give you some level of Web3 exposure. Several companies actively involved in Web3 are Web2 companies with multiple sources of income, and so might not be affected by a Web3 downturn like these Web3 stocks: NFTs are unique digital assets on a blockchain. They show ownership and cannot be copied. You can buy an NFT from a secondary marketplace such as OpenSea or Magic Eden or choose to mint them and hold for a profit. NFTs are important Web3 investments because they can be used to unlock special privileges or as an investment in a Web3 company. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies operated by a decentralized entity on the blockchain. Like regular money, crypto can be used to pay for goods and services and as an investment option. Crypto allows direct exposure into the space and is a good fit for people who want to aggressively invest in Web 3.0 Crypto is highly volatile. So, if you\u2019re a risk-averse trader, you might want to consider other lower-risk options like crypto ETFs and fractional shares. These options provide you with direct exposure but cushion you from the market's daily volatility. Web 3.0 investments, like any other investment, poses some risk to investors. The biggest risks are volatility, security, and reliability on existing Web3 investment processes and infrastructures. The foundation of Web3 is built on emerging technologies such as blockchain tech, smart contracts, and AI. An investment into Web3 positions gives you the chance to be an early adopter of these disruptive technologies. Web3 has the potential to overturn how we do almost everything, from shopping to payments to the way we consume content. As an investment class, Web3 will shape how companies will raise startup capital and generate money from their funding rounds. Most importantly, investment in Web3 is largely profitable and can provide impressive returns over shorter time frames. To get the most out of any Web3 investment, you must: Investing in Web3 can be challenging, especially if you don\u2019t have a clear plan or failed to do your research. It\u2019s essential you consider these factors before you make a Web3 investment: After you have clearly designed and mapped out your investment goals and the investment timeline, you need to know the founders behind the Web3 project of interest. Choose projects with publicly known founders. You can easily reach out in case the project goes south. Assess your risk tolerance level and go for a project allowed in your country to avoid legal issues with your investment. Web 3.0 (or Web3) is a general name for the new, user-centric version of the internet that integrates new concepts like decentralization, blockchain tech, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) into everyday internet use. It is a decentralized version of the internet that promises to help users better control their data usage and sharing while enhancing monetization and reducing exposure to data manipulation. The concept of Web3 is not to make our current internet obsolete; it\u2019s to integrate these technologies into the existing infrastructure, allowing everyone to freely use the internet. For example, if you make a Facebook or Instagram post that goes against Meta\u2019s community standards, the social media giant could take the post down or ban your account. This would likely be impossible in Web 3.0 since most platforms will be decentralized. Although it is still a work in progress, many individuals, companies, and even governments have started to position themselves adequately for web3. The Hong Kong government is preparing to adopt a framework for integrating this technology into many of its city's processes. Since Gavin Wood coined the term in 2014, Web3 has grown to offer potential for diverse opportunities. In recent years, there have been lots of conversations around Web3 and the opportunities it offers investors. While Web3 investment opportunities have become an industry buzzword, many have yet to realize its importance and how they can invest before it officially launches. No. You cannot invest directly in Web 3.0, but you can choose to be an active or passive investor through a variety of investment options. Active investment options include cryptocurrency and NFTs, while passive investment options involve buying stocks in companies actively engaged in Web 3.0. Web 2.0 is the current internet, which has birthed innovations like social media, e-commerce stores, and search engines. These innovations have made content king and provided a way to create content, unlike in Web 1.0, where internet users could only access limited information. Although beneficial, these Web 2.0 innovations introduced data and privacy issues, giving tech giants access to tons of user data. Web 3.0 is an upgrade to Web 2.0 and offers a way for internet users to control their data, use decentralized technologies to store and share information, and voluntarily conceal their digital identities. In Web 3.0, users will make faster and cheaper payments for goods and services using cryptocurrencies. With Metaverse development currently underway, Web3 could change how we experience the world around us, opening us to more immersive experiences e.g the Metaverse. Web 3.0 investment options are more volatile than regular investment options. Although not completely unsafe, there is a big risk of ending up on the wrong side of the volatility. This is why it\u2019s critical to have a good level of knowledge, do your research, and come up with a robust investment plan. Another issue of concern is in regards to the current state of regulations. This new technology is still very much unregulated, and governments and regulating bodies could institute policies unfavorable to investors. Web 3.0 investing is not for all types of investors, especially those with a low-risk appetite or who are looking to get into investing gradually. It is a fast-moving investment class that requires some level of industry knowledge, patience, and timing. The nature of Web 3 investments makes them a good fit for investors who fall into any of the categories below. Investing in Web 3.0 is highly risky. As a Web3 investor, you should have a huge risk appetite and only put in money you can afford to lose. The volatility of many Web 3 assets makes it a highly unpredictable asset class. For example, between February 20, 2023, and March 10, 2023, Bitcoin rose to $24,500 and plummeted to $19,500 before touching $30k. Without a huge risk appetite, you could prematurely sell your investments and make constant losses. To make tangible returns on your Web 3.0 investment, you need to put in a significant sum of money. Since it is recommended that you use not more than 10% of your entire portfolio to make Web3 investments, you need to have a diversified portfolio that is not fully reliant on this investment class. A higher capital investment would yield more returns but could also translate into more losses. Consider investing in leveraged assets and futures trading if you have a big risk appetite but limited capital.

Learn what it takes to store NFTs Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are distinctive digital files on a blockchain network that are completely unique. Unlike trading cards, you cannot switch NFTs for each other. Crypto enthusiasts can make anything into an NFT, including clothes, doodles, and even a family rental, which recently sold for almost $247,000. But you need an NFT wallet to keep your collectibles safe while protecting them from thieves. There are several options available: hot wallets, often provided by crypto exchanges or cold wallets with an emphasis on security. The best NFT wallets securely display your collection and easily connect to NFT marketplaces. We\u2019ve compiled the basics every NFT enthusiast should know, and have structured this guide for storing NFTs to answer the questions most novice users have. Storing NFTs is easy, especially if you have experience with using a crypto wallet. In fact, many NFT wallets are crypto wallets that are modified to support NFTs. Buying and storing NFTs differs from buying and storing cryptocurrency, although the processes are similar. After buying an NFT, you need to keep it somewhere. The best place to store NFTs is in an NFT wallet. However, project creators also use alternative methods like the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store their NFTs. The IPFS stores metadata, images, and other assets off the blockchain. They can be accessed with a custom IPFS URL anytime. Here's how to buy an NFT and store it in your wallet. Step 1: Browse NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea to search for NFTs to buy if you do not have a particular one in mind to buy. The NFT marketplace is where people buy and sell NFTs. Step 2: Download an NFT wallet from your device\u2019s app store. Ensure the wallet you want to download supports the NFT you intend to buy or mint. For example, some Solana NFTs will not work on Metamask. Step 3: Connect your wallet to your chosen marketplace. Most NFT marketplaces have the WalletConnect feature to help connect your wallet to the marketplace easily. Step 4: Do a dummy transaction to see how much you will pay in gas fees for your purchase. This step is important to ensure you do not go back and forth getting your NFT due to incomplete gas. Step 5: Confirm that you have the correct gas fee. If you have the correct gas fee in your wallet, you\u2019re ready to buy your NFT. If you do not, send the fee (and a little extra) to your wallet, then hit buy. Step 6: Confirm that the NFT is in your wallet and your purchase is complete. Setting up an NFT wallet is similar to setting up a crypto wallet. First, download or purchase an NFT wallet of your choosing. Then, set up your profile, following KYC protocol if you pick a hot wallet. The following documents are typically required to complete your profile: Cold wallets usually do not require KYC and are suitable for users who intend to bypass it. You need to set up your cold wallet by connecting it to your device and configuring it. To use a hot NFT wallet for the first time, you will be required to submit some basic personal information for KYC purposes. Companies providing financial services, even in crypto, must implement KYC procedures for legal reasons and to identify bad actors who might be using the wallet. An NFT wallet company does not usually use personal information for anything other than identification. The kind of personal information that you need to provide include: It is important you fill in only the correct information, especially your phone number and email address. This information is also used for 2FA and communication purposes. Investing in cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi), and other initial coin offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and the markets can be extremely volatile. Consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions. This article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies nor can the accuracy or timeliness of the information be guaranteed. Often provided by crypto exchanges, hot wallets are digital wallets that are always connected to the internet to facilitate frequent transactions. These computer programs are popular because they are easy to download and use. As an extra benefit, you can easily store purchased NFTs in these wallets for free. Since they are always connected to the internet, however, hot wallets are less secure than cold wallets as they are more susceptible to hacking and other forms of cyberattacks. Cold wallets are physical devices that store digital assets off the internet to protect against unauthorized access by storing your private keys on your device alone. These are ideal for storing blue-chip NFTs or NFTs that you do not need regular access to over long-term periods. As for security, losing your private key or cold storage device could mean an irrecoverable loss of any NFTs in the wallet. Cold wallets are not free, as you need to buy a physical device. Since they cost more than a hot wallet, it is advisable to buy cold storage only if you have valuable digital assets to store. Storing and protecting your NFTs on hot wallets is usually free; you only need to pay for transactions. On the other hand, cold wallets for NFT storage are more expensive, ranging from $140 to $400. Note that not all cold wallets are NFT wallets, so when shopping for a cold wallet, ensure the model you go for is NFT-compatible. Wallet quality/safety: You should pick an NFT wallet with at least a PIN (personal identification number) or 2FA (two-factor authentication) feature to prevent losing your assets to thieves and hackers. Beware of wallets that lack security or only enable biometric security without advanced protection measures. User interface (UI): When looking for a place to store NFTs, prioritize wallets with an intuitive user interface that eases interaction with your NFTs. If you are a beginner, pick wallets that display all your NFTs, show how much your collection is worth, and have a search bar to find any NFTs easily, all in one glance. Connectivity: Choose a cold wallet with Bluetooth and software connectivity, ensuring your wallet connects seamlessly to its corresponding software on your phone/PC. These features help you process NFT transactions much faster. Setup time: Most hot NFT wallets take five to 10 minutes to set up. Completing KYC processes might take five minutes to a few days, but once you are past those, the wallet is ready to use. Cold wallets have a longer setup duration, with beginners often needing one to two hours to complete the process. Fees (if applicable): Unlike cold storage, using a hot wallet to store digital assets is free. For both wallet types, users are required to pay a small network fee to send or list your NFT on a marketplace. Customer support: Before you select an NFT wallet, check that it has a live chat/support option. This is the best way to contact the company if you have an urgent issue with your wallet. Storage and custody: A cold wallet is your best option for sole access to your NFTs. It prevents anyone from accessing your NFTs, including its creators and the wallet company. Hot wallet users are prone to face what FTX users suffered with the exchange because the exchange had access to customers\u2019 crypto holdings. But frequent NFT traders will find a hot wallet more useful for faster transactions and easier access to their NFTs. NFTs (nNon-fFungible tTokens) are unique digital artwork or representations of physical assets backed by a token on a blockchain network. An NFT is as unique as a fingerprint, as the blockchain generates a unique token every time someone mints an NFT. NFTs are quite different from regular digital files as the latter have no backing on the blockchain. This is why you cannot present the screenshot of an NFT as proof you own it. Anyone can create an NFT with a digital file, some crypto to pay gas fees, access to a minting platform, and an NFT wallet. Most people, however, simply buy NFTs instead of minting them. Researching an NFT project before you decide to buy it is important. One way to explore a project is to check if its founders are known publicly (doxxed). Projects with such founders have a lower chance of being fake. Many popular companies are entering the NFT space, and are now seen as reputable sources from which NFTs can be purchased. For instance, Starbucks recently sold 2,000 NFTs in minutes in March 2023. While Meta also started supporting NFTs on Instagram and Facebook in 2022, the company halted this practice in March 2023. Famous NFT projects like the Bored Ape Yacht Collection are also viewed as solid project sources. Regardless of the NFT project you choose, you need an NFT wallet to go with it. NFTs are tokens that show ownership of digital assets. To own an NFT, you need to buy the token backing it. Most NFTs are sold in cryptocurrency, which depends on the NFT\u2019s blockchain. For example, an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain will be purchased in the Ethereum coin, Ether (ETH). NFTs can give you special holder rights like the right to participate in an organization\u2019s governorship or an opportunity to make some money by holding and selling them. NFT wallets are different from other digital wallets because they can: NFTs are not bad for the environment, but minting and transacting with NFTs can adversely affect the environment if not properly checked. Due to the high computational power required to run a blockchain, many NFTs are minted using significant amounts of energy. However, blockchain networks that support NFTs like Algorand are going green, which may lead to more eco-friendly NFT transactions. NFT wallets on your device will only make you money if you have an NFT. You can earn from your NFT by either selling or staking it. Selling an NFT is straightforward, as you simply buy or mint an NFT, keep it in your wallet, and sell it for a better price later. The money you make from the sale will immediately be available in your NFT wallet. With staking, you lend your NFT to the blockchain in return for rewards, which can either be paid out in the project\u2019s native token, another NFT, or a crypto of the project\u2019s choice. These rewards accumulate in your NFT wallet.

Arsenii Palivoda / Getty Images Bitcoin options are financial derivatives that enable investors to speculate on the price of the digital currency with leverage or hedge their digital asset portfolios. Available on both traditional derivatives exchanges and on crypto trading platforms, Bitcoin options have emerged as a popular investment product among advanced crypto traders. For individuals looking to trade Bitcoin options, finding the right trading venue that offers ample liquidity and a high level of security is essential. We\u2019ve compiled the basics every option trader should know, and have structured this guide for trading Bitcoin options to answer the most common questions novice option traders have. Options are financial derivatives contracts that give holders the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a predetermined amount of an asset at a specified price, and at a specific date in the future. In the case of Bitcoin options, the underlying asset is the cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC). While the cryptocurrency options market is still fairly new, you can already trade Bitcoin and Ethereum options on a handful of traditional securities exchanges and crypto trading platforms. Traders who wish to gain exposure to Bitcoin now have additional choices. The 11 recently launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in January 2024, each offer a basket of cryptocurrency securities and can be traded on Cboe BZX, NYSE Arca, and Nasdaq. Cryptocurrency options function in essentially the same way as option contracts on assets like stocks, indexes, or commodities. However, crypto options are generally less liquid than ETF options, index options, or on heavily traded commodities like gold. This is a result of the relatively smaller size of the crypto market when compared to other investment markets. The result is that crypto options feature a comparatively bigger gap between the bid and ask price. This generates higher transaction costs in trading crypto options. There are two main types of options contracts: European and American. The key difference between the two is that European-style options can only be exercised at expiration, while American-style options can be exercised at any time up until the expiry date. An options position can either be in the money, at the money, or out of the money. You can either buy a call or a put option. A call gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset, while a put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset. Whether you buy or sell a Bitcoin put option or call option depends on whether you want to speculate on a rising or falling price or whether you are looking to hedge crypto exposure. Options can either be cash settled or physically settled. For example, if you trade cocoa options, you could\u2014if the options contract determines it\u2014receive shipments of cocoa once the options contract expires. When bitcoin options are settled physically, the bitcoin is transferred between the two parties. When cash settlement is used, the parties would exchange dollars or another currency. Generally, you'll want an options trading platform that supports the trades you're looking to make, with costs that are affordable for you. Our picks of the best options trading platforms below allow you to trade options, cryptocurrency, and even crypto futures. For Bitcoin options specifically, a crypto trading platform is likely preferable. Examples of crypto trading platforms that provide Bitcoin options include: Before you begin, know that trading cryptocurrency options involves a high level of risk. If you are new to derivatives trading, you should start with a demo account to learn the ins and outs of options trading before putting investment capital at risk. Also, keep in mind that Bitcoin itself is not regulated as a security, but rather is considered a digital currency. Investing in cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi), and initial coin offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and the markets can be extremely volatile. Consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions. Trading Bitcoin options is generally riskier than buying and selling Bitcoin in the spot market. For example, suppose you buy a call option on Bitcoin with a strike price of $35,000 and an expiry date that is three months away. If the price of Bitcoin doesn\u2019t surpass $35,000 by the expiration date, you will lose the options premium (the price you paid for the option) in full. When trading Bitcoin options, the price of Bitcoin is not the only factor affecting the value of options contracts. There are several key factors that affect the value of the options you buy or sell, but time decay is by far the most critical. That\u2019s because as the time moves closer to the expiry date, the value of an options contract decreases because the time remaining to trade or exercise the options diminishes. While Bitcoin options can be found on traditional securities exchanges, like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and on dedicated crypto trading platforms, the BTC options market is still quite young and doesn\u2019t have the deep liquidity found in mature options markets. This can affect price slippage, especially in options with longer maturities. Trading Bitcoin options is different from trading spot Bitcoin. Not only is the risk profile of your trade completely different, but there is a range of different aspects to consider when looking at which Bitcoin options contracts to buy or sell. Before you can start trading Bitcoin options, you need to sign up with an exchange that supports crypto derivatives.\u00a0If your online brokerage account provides you with access to the CME, you could trade Bitcoin options on the leading securities exchange. For most private investors, however, the more likely choice will be to sign up with a digital asset exchange that offers Bitcoin options trading, such as Bit.com, Bybit, Deribit, or OKX. Here\u2019s how it works. Find a digital asset exchange that offers Bitcoin options trading. Ensure you select a reputable exchange; then complete the onboarding process. Next, deposit U.S. dollars (using one of the exchange\u2019s available fiat funding options) or cryptocurrency in your exchange account. Ideally, the exchange you have signed up for offers a demo trading account where you can start trading Bitcoin options without putting real capital at risk. That way, you can become comfortable with how the options Greeks affect Bitcoin options. Learn what drives the price of Bitcoin to get an idea of what type of options trading strategy is best suited for the cryptocurrency and for your risk/return profile. The more you learn about the Bitcoin market and Bitcoin options, the more likely you'll be able to trade options profitably. Once you feel comfortable with Bitcoin options and how they work, you can place your first trade using the platform. To open an options trading account, you'll need the same documents as for a standard spot trading account. Crypto options trading platforms generally require the following information from you: Additionally, to pass a trading platform\u2019s Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process, you may also need to provide a scanned copy of your government-issued ID (such as a passport or a driver\u2019s license) and proof of address (such as a utility bill or a bank statement). You may also be asked questions about your level of expertise as a trader to enable access to derivatives trading products on the platform. Crypto exchanges generally have very low minimum deposits; $10 to $20 is the industry standard, although there are also trading apps that allow you to start buying crypto with as little as $1. To trade Bitcoin options, however, you will definitely need more than $1 to get started. Even the cheapest BTC options contracts have premiums worth over $10. Trading on cryptocurrency exchanges is a little different. Unlike traditional brokerage firms, cryptocurrency exchanges are not members of the Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC). Therefore, unless user terms specify otherwise, investors with cryptocurrency assets commingled on a custodial cryptocurrency exchange could potentially lose their funds as unsecured creditors. The three main types of cryptocurrency exchanges are centralized, decentralized, and hybrid. Centralized crypto exchanges are online trading platforms that look and feel like traditional online brokerages. You can use them to trade a range of cryptocurrencies in the same way you would buy stocks, bonds, or ETFs using an online broker account after you have registered and completed KYC verification. Decentralized crypto exchanges are Internet-native online trading venues powered by smart contracts that allow traders to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on a peer-to-peer basis. Crypto assets are traded directly from wallet to wallet. There is no need to create an account or complete a KYC onboarding process, making decentralized crypto exchanges accessible to anyone in the world. Hybrid crypto exchanges merge a centralized order book for matching trades with decentralized crypto asset custody, allowing crypto traders and investors to benefit from the best features of both types of crypto exchanges. When choosing where you'll place your trades, keep the following factors in mind: No. Bitcoin futures are not the same as Bitcoin options.\u00a0Bitcoin futures obligate the buyer to purchase or the seller to sell a predetermined amount of Bitcoin at a specific price and date in the future. Conversely, Bitcoin options give the holder the right but not the obligation to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predefined price and date in the future. Therefore, options are more flexible than futures. Bitcoin options are an excellent investment product for hedging digital asset exposure.\u00a0For example, if you have a crypto portfolio composed of long positions in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Stacks (STX), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana (SOL), you could purchase Bitcoin put options with a 100% hedge ratio so that if the crypto market crashes and your portfolio drops in value, your profit on the BTC put options contracts would offset roughly all of your losses on your crypto portfolio. Should the market not drop in this scenario, you will lose the money you paid for the options contracts. Yes, but not on all exchanges.\u00a0Numerous digital asset exchanges provide crypto derivatives, including Bitcoin options, on their platforms. Notable examples include Bybit, Deribit, and OKX. There, you will find BTC options contracts with various strike prices and expiration dates, giving crypto traders the flexibility to execute complex options trading strategies. Traders wishing to execute a Bitcoin options trading strategy should choose their trading platform or cryptocurrency exchange with care. There's always risk when trading derivatives, but the relatively new and illiquid nature of the Bitcoin options market means traders should exercise additional caution to protect their investment capital.

Learn what it takes to buy Shiba Inu oatawa / Getty Images Shiba Inu is arguably one of the biggest meme tokens ever, second only to Dogecoin. At its peak in October 2021, the coin had racked up a market cap of over $40 billion, and it is now accepted as a means of payment at popular retail stores, like GameStop and Nordstrom. You can gain access to Shiba Inu through popular crypto exchanges such as Coinbase or Binance. Like all cryptocurrency, however, investing in Shiba Inu is risky. Therefore, ensure you do your due diligence before adding this meme token to your portfolio. Investing in cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi), and other initial coin offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and the markets can be extremely volatile. Consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions. This article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies nor can the accuracy or timeliness of the information be guaranteed. Digital currencies are types of currencies that you cannot touch or feel. Unlike conventional currencies, they only exist virtually. Cryptocurrencies are popular examples of digital currencies. A meme token like Shiba Inu is one coin you might have encountered in your research. This token rose to popularity in 2021 and is still a favorite choice for investors today. Ryoshi is the alias used to identify the creator of this dog-themed cryptocurrency, invented in 2020. Coinbase director Conor Grogan has suggested Ryoshi might be linked to Alameda Research, FTX\u2019s sister company. Its popularity is only rivaled by the Yuga Labs NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club, especially with its massive Shiba army promoting the coin on various socials. Shiba Inu is known particularly for its Japanese dog mascot and high volatility. It was created as a solution to Dogecoin\u2019s inefficiencies, but it still doesn't have much use case. Either way, some retailers and companies accept it as a means of payment. Examples of such companies are NOWpayments, Gucci, and Nordstrom. The Shiba Inu ecosystem is expected to grow, especially with the release of Shibarium\u2019s beta version in March 2023. Shibarium is Shiba Inu\u2019s Layer 2 solution, the blockchain where Shiba Inu and other tokens in the Shiba ecosystem, like Leash and Bone, are deployed. The Shiba ecosystem also has a metaverse called the Shiba Metaverse, which gives users a place they can build, run, and grow their projects.\u00a0 The immersive virtual world features a WAGMI temple, the first of 11 HUBs in SHIB The Metaverse, which previewed at the SXSW XR Experience also in March 2023. These and more are all the exciting developments happening in the Shiba Ecosystem. Doing your research before buying any cryptocurrency, especially meme tokens, is important. Many cryptocurrencies look legit, but more research can show you the ones worth investing in. A good rule of thumb is to read the whitepaper or litepaper of the crypto you intend to buy; a litepaper, if you can find it, is better. It is the concise version of a whitepaper that will give you the information you need to make a better decision. To buy Shiba Inu, you will need a cryptocurrency exchange or wallet. While a crypto wallet allows you to purchase or sell Shiba Inu, a cryptocurrency exchange gives you much more flexibility to trade Shiba Inu futures and even earn from staking. Here is how to buy Shiba Inu on a crypto exchange: Crypto exchanges are the best way to get Shiba Inu. However, they are not the only way. You can also buy Shiba Inu from other people directly. To do this, you first need to find a physical or online seller willing to exchange their Shiba for money. When you both agree on quantity and price, the seller transfers the Shiba Inu to your Shiba Inu wallet address in exchange for your fiat. Alternatively, you can swap other crypto types in your wallet for Shiba Inu instead of depositing crypto or fiat money. Find a suitable trading pair and sell your existing crypto for Shiba Inu. The process happens instantaneously. Unlike traditional brokerage firms, cryptocurrency exchanges are not members of the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC). Therefore, unless user terms specify otherwise, investors with cryptocurrency assets commingled on a custodial cryptocurrency exchange could potentially lose their funds as\u00a0unsecured creditors. There are certain requirements that need to be met for you to open an account on a cryptocurrency exchange. Let\u2019s explore them now. Most cryptocurrency exchanges, especially centralized ones, will require you to fill out personal information before accessing its full features. This information is needed to complete the KYC process. Here is the personal information you will need to submit: A critical step is to ensure that your information has been entered correctly, as any irregularities in your application could delay account approval. Once your account is approved or verified, you can instantly start trading. The minimum deposit required will vary depending on which exchange you use and which payment method you use. For example, if you use a debit or credit card, you might need to deposit a minimum of $10 to $50. For other methods like peer-to-peer (P2P) or direct fiat deposit, you can deposit as little as $2 on many exchanges. Many crypto exchanges do not require you to maintain a specific balance; however, the amount you can trade values anywhere between $1 to $20. A centralized exchange is a cryptocurrency exchange owned by a company or an entity that helps you trade your crypto for a fee by acting as a go-between. These exchanges save you the stress of waiting for orders as they have better liquidity resources. Centralized exchanges also allow you to save and earn crypto. This crypto exchange allows you to trade or swap your crypto directly with a buyer or seller by creating a connection to their crypto wallets, thereby removing the need for a central authority. These exchanges are usually safer than centralized exchanges as they do not store crypto on a centralized exchange. Perhaps the most compelling argument for choosing decentralized exchanges is that it shields you from being tied to situations like the FTX collapse, since your assets are held separate from a centralized exchange wallet. In other words, if a decentralized exchange were to be hacked or the company operating it becomes insolvent, user funds would remain unaffected. These exchanges combine the functionalities of decentralized and centralized exchanges by giving users greater liquidity than typical decentralized exchanges. Many hybrid exchanges use smart contracts to secure transactions and ensure the safety of funds for all parties involved. Security: Security is essential to prevent the loss of your funds. Ideally, you should choose an exchange with two-factor authentication (2FA), another measure that can protect your crypto from hackers. In addition, ensure that you choose an exchange with a strong reputation and cybersecurity track record. Fees: An exchange with high fees will eventually cost you more, especially if you are a frequent trader or investor. It is best you look for an exchange with moderate deposit, withdrawal, and trading fees. Number and quality of supported cryptocurrencies: While you want to go for an exchange that supports a wide number of cryptos, you do not want to go with one that lists just any kind of crypto. Look at all the crypto an exchange offers and see if all are thoroughly vetted. Wallet quality and safety: The quality of a wallet\u2019s security features is a critical factor that can help you enjoy crypto investing for the long term. It is imperative that you choose an exchange that offers a secure wallet with multi-layer security measures and a strong reputation for security. Storage and custody: Do you prefer a custodial or non-custodial wallet? While a custodial wallet makes your crypto more accessible, it is more susceptible to hacks. A non-custodial wallet leaves everything in your hands, but this also means when anything goes bad, you take full responsibility. For the safety of your funds, choose a decentralized exchange. This type of exchange gives you exclusive access to your crypto and can help prevent the misappropriation of user funds that was at the center of the 2022 FTX collapse. Shiba Inu is based on the Ethereum blockchain, so when you initiate a transaction, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and cannot be altered. This info is linked to all others in the block to form the blockchain, where transactions are finally approved with consensus. There are several use cases for Shiba Inu. Traders or investors can make money through price speculation. Holders can use it as a payment method for real-life commodities at accepted retail outlets and/or to buy Shiboshi NFTs on the Shiba ecosystem. Advanced users can use their existing Shiba Inu tokens at liquidity pools to gain rewards. The primary way to earn with Shiba Inu is to stake your coins. Many exchanges offer this service, allowing you to earn a fixed percentage of money for a specific period. To stake your Shiba Inu, you must have some of it in your wallet. When you\u2019ve satisfied this requirement, search for the staking section on your preferred exchange and choose a time frame you are comfortable with, then stake your Shiba Inu tokens. Another way you can earn is by burning your tokens on the Shibaswap portal. Burning means removing cryptocurrencies from circulation, reducing the total supply in the process. In most cases, burning helps a coin\u2019s price appreciate. When you burn your Shiba Inu, you get rewarded with another token in the Shiba ecosystem. It's important to remember that crypto assets are high-risk investments. Therefore, conducting thorough research is essential before making the decision to add Shiba Inu to your crypto portfolio.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn what it takes to buy Dogecoin Jackyenjoyphotography / Getty Images Dogecoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency available on most crypto exchanges that was created as a parody of Bitcoin, and has gained significant attention due to its meme-inspired branding and support from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. While some see Dogecoin as a promising crypto asset due to its November 2024 surge to a three-and-half-year high of 44 cents and growing mainstream acceptance, others warn that it is highly volatile, with billions of new coins being minted each year. Like all cryptocurrency, investing in Dogecoin is risky. Therefore, ensure you do your due diligence before adding this meme coin to your portfolio. Investing in cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi), and other initial coin offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and the markets can be extremely volatile. Consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions. This article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies nor can the accuracy or timeliness of the information be guaranteed. Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in 2013 as a joke, making fun of the wild speculation of the crypto market at that time. Similar to other digital currencies, Dogecoin operates on a blockchain network and is secured by cryptography. A promising feature is its fast transaction speed with low transaction fees, which makes it attractive for micro-transactions. Additionally, the Dogecoin community has a history of supporting charitable causes and individuals, including raising funds for the Jamaican bobsled team, collecting donations to build a well in Kenya, and sponsoring NASCAR driver Josh Wise. Dogecoin made headlines in February 2023 when one of Elon Musk's tweets caused a spike in Dogecoin's price. Additionally, in December 2022, the Dogecoin Foundation announced a new fund of 5 million DOGE (around $345,000 at the time) to support the development of the cryptocurrency's ecosystem to help ensure the longevity and sustainability of Dogecoin. In order to buy Dogecoin, users need to create an account on a reputable cryptocurrency exchange, which is a digital marketplace where you can buy, sell, and trade multiple cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin. Once an account is set up and verified, you can deposit funds, either in the form of fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Here are the steps to help you buy Dogecoin: Step 1: Sign up for a crypto exchange. Create an account on a well-known cryptocurrency exchange, such as Coinbase, Kraken, or Binance, by providing information like email address, name, and phone number. Step 2: Verify your account. Verify your account with personal details like proof of address. In some cases, you may also need to undergo a Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process. Step 3: Deposit funds to your account. You can deposit money into your cryptocurrency account through various methods, such as credit or debit cards, depending on the exchange's policies, as well as your jurisdiction. Step 4: Find DOGE, check market price, and buy. Search for Dogecoin (DOGE) on the exchange, check its market price, and make a purchase. Generally, it takes less than a minute before you can see DOGE in your crypto exchange wallet. After making the purchase, you can transfer your Dogecoin(s) to your other wallets. An alternative way to buy Dogecoin is through peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces that allow you to buy DOGE directly from other individuals instead of using a centralized exchange. These platforms match buyers and sellers and provide a secure escrow system to facilitate the transaction. One more way of buying DOGE is by exchanging it with other forms of crypto in your wallet. For example, if you have Bitcoin or Ethereum, you can exchange them for Dogecoin on exchanges like Uniswap and Kraken. This method can be faster and more cost-effective than buying DOGE with fiat currency. Unlike traditional brokerage firms, cryptocurrency exchanges are not members of the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC). Therefore, unless user terms specify otherwise, investors with cryptocurrency assets commingled on a custodial cryptocurrency exchange could potentially lose their funds as\u00a0unsecured creditors. To open a cryptocurrency exchange account, you typically need to provide the following documents and information. Here are some of the key pieces of personal information that a crypto enthusiast may need to provide to open a cryptocurrency exchange account: Additionally, many cryptocurrency exchanges require users to go through a KYC (Know Your Customer) process to verify their identity. This may involve submitting government-issued identification documents, such as a passport or driver's license, and a proof of address, such as a utility bill or bank statement. The minimum deposit to open a cryptocurrency exchange account varies widely depending on the exchange and the type of account you are opening. Some exchanges require no minimum deposit at all, while others may require a deposit of at least $10, $50, or even $100 or more. The deposit amount may also depend on the payment method you are using. In addition to the minimum deposit, some exchanges may also require a minimum balance to be maintained in the account to avoid account closure or inactivity fees. These fees can range from a few dollars to several hundred dollars per year, depending on the exchange and the amount of the minimum balance requirement. Centralized exchanges (CEX) are cryptocurrency trading platforms that are operated and controlled by a central authority. They typically require users to create an account in order to trade cryptocurrencies. CEXs are popular because they offer a wide variety of trading pairs, high liquidity, and advanced trading features. One of the main benefits of centralized exchanges is their high level of security. CEXs typically have strong security measures in place to protect user funds. In addition, CEXs often have customer support teams to assist users with issues such as deposit and withdrawal problems. Decentralized exchanges (DEX) are cryptocurrency trading platforms that operate on a decentralized blockchain network, meaning that they are not controlled by a central authority. Instead, they use smart contracts and blockchain technology to facilitate peer-to-peer trades between users. DEXs are popular among cryptocurrency enthusiasts who value privacy, security, and decentralization. One of the main benefits of DEXs is that they offer a high level of security and privacy. Since DEXs do not hold user funds or personal information, they are less vulnerable to hacking attacks than centralized exchanges. Additionally, DEXs do not require KYC/AML (anti-money laundering) procedures, meaning that users can trade cryptocurrencies without providing personal information. Hybrid exchanges are cryptocurrency trading platforms that combine features of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. They offer the security and privacy benefits of decentralized exchanges, as well as the liquidity and user-friendly interface of centralized exchanges. Hybrid exchanges typically use a decentralized architecture, with trades being executed on a decentralized network. However, they also have a central authority that manages the order book and provides liquidity, which ensures fast and reliable trades. When opening a crypto exchange account, it is important to consider several factors to ensure that you are choosing a reputable and reliable platform. Here are some of the key factors to consider: Security: Look for an exchange that has robust security measures in place, such as two-factor authentication, cold storage of funds, and regular security audits. Fees: Different exchanges have different fee structures, and these fees can significantly affect your trading costs and overall profitability. Therefore, you should compare fees across different exchanges to find the best deal. Number and quality of supported cryptocurrencies: Ensure that the exchange supports the cryptocurrencies you want to trade, as well as any fiat currencies you may want to use to buy or sell crypto. Wallet quality and safety: Most reputable crypto exchanges offer their own wallets for users to store their cryptocurrencies. It's important to choose an exchange that provides a high-quality wallet with robust security features. You should also consider the reputation of the exchange's wallet provider, as well as its track record for security and reliability Storage and custody: When choosing a crypto exchange, you should look for one that offers secure storage and custody solutions for your cryptocurrencies. This includes features such as cold storage, multi-signature authorization, and insurance coverage for theft or loss of funds. Centralized vs Decentralized Exchanges: Centralized exchanges (CEXs) have stronger security measures in place as they are subject to regulation by government authorities. However, as the collapse of FTX in 2022 shows, regulatory oversight may not always be sufficient to protect against internal fraudulent activities. While decentralized exchanges (DEXs) can offer greater security due to their distributed nature, they can also be more vulnerable to technical vulnerabilities due to the complexity of their underlying protocols. Therefore, regardless of whether you are using a CEX or a DEX, using best practices for security and risk management, such as using offline storage solutions and regularly monitoring your accounts, can help you protect against incidents like the FTX fraud. Dogecoin is based on the same underlying technology as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, using a decentralized blockchain to record transactions and maintain a public ledger. It isn't controlled by any central authority or government. Instead, transactions are processed and verified by a network of computers around the world, and new coins are created through a process called mining. You can use Dogecoin to make purchases or send them to other users as payment. Some merchants and businesses accept Dogecoin as payment, and there are also various online communities and forums where users can trade Dogecoin for goods and services. Some cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets allow users to earn rewards by staking their Dogecoin, which involves holding their coins in a wallet and using them to help validate transactions on the network. This can be a passive way to earn rewards, but it may require a minimum balance and may be subject to fees or other restrictions. Dogecoin has become closely associated with Elon Musk. He has frequently tweeted about Dogecoin, calling it his favorite cryptocurrency and jokingly referring to himself as the \"Dogefather.\" His tweets have caused significant fluctuations in the price of Dogecoin, leading some to question whether his statements are manipulating the market. Musk has also referenced Dogecoin in interviews and on social media, leading many of his followers to become interested in the cryptocurrency. It's important to remember that crypto assets are high-risk investments. Therefore, conducting thorough research is essential before making the decision to add DOGE to your crypto portfolio.

Finally, if you are looking for a more advanced wallet that enables you to deploy Ethereum smart contracts, MyEtherWallet is your best choice. Most adults have a beginner's understanding of cryptocurrency, but plan on using such assets as a key source of retirement funds, according to the 2022 Investopedia Financial Literacy Survey. An excellent Ethereum wallet should provide a high level of security, be user-friendly, and allow users to interact with the entire Ethereum ecosystem. To be more specific, an Ethereum wallet should be non-custodial, enabling you to hold your own private keys to give you complete control over your funds. Moreover, despite the technical knowledge that is required to buy, store, and use cryptocurrency, a wallet should make the process as simple and beginner-friendly as possible. Additionally, an Ethereum wallet should allow you to store all types of Ethereum-based tokens, including ERC-20 tokens, like Ether (ETH), and NFTs. And finally, it should provide you with the ability to interact with decentralized applications (dApps), such as DeFi protocols and play-to-earn (P2E) games, within the Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum is a distributed peer-to-peer computing platform that enables developers to build smart contract-powered decentralized products and services. Founded in 2013 and launched during an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2015, Ethereum has established itself as the second-largest crypto network after Bitcoin, and the leading smart contract-enabled layer-1 blockchain. In September 2022, Ethereum changed its consensus protocol from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), alleviating the ability for miners to take part in the Ethereum network. Instead, validators now stake a share of their ETH tokens by depositing them into a validator program to help secure the network and validate transactions. Ethereum users have the ability to stake ETH tokens to take part in the protocol\u2019s consensus mechanism in exchange for staking rewards paid in ETH. To start staking Ether, you will need a minimum of 32 ETH. However, there are also liquidity staking providers that enable you to take part in Ethereum staking with less than the required minimum to become a full validator. You can buy Ether (ETH) on a wide range of crypto exchanges using different payment methods, including wire transfer, debit card, and credit card. One of the most important things to consider before you transact in and store Ethereum is that you have a suitable Ethereum wallet in place. To help determine the wallet that works best for you, we conducted a comprehensive review process of the top Ethereum software wallets. With your digital holdings at stake, the most crucial consideration is the reputation and security of the wallet you choose. Our top Ethereum wallets were selected after we reviewed 24 companies based on their security, reputation, features, fees, and customer service.

            "content": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Skylar Clarine is a fact-checker and expert in personal finance with a range of experience including veterinary technology and film studies. Bloomberg Creative Photos / Getty Images Countries like Iran, Venezuela, and El Salvador have all faced protracted and difficult crises, with sharp increases in inflation and the cost of living. Now, some people in these nations are turning to cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange and as a store of value. This has led some analysts to predict that bitcoin and other digital currencies could one day take the place of fiats like the Bol\u00edvar, the Rial, or other troubled government-issued currencies. Below, we'll explore some of the potential causes for these shifts. Even before bitcoin captured the attention of mainstream investors, the world's largest cryptocurrency had drawn interest from citizens of Venezuela. Venezuela implemented capital controls in 2003, and U.S. sanctions have had a suffocating effect on that country's economy. Because hyperinflation has been a major factor in the Venezuelan economy for decades, many Venezuelans turned to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a convenient store of value. It is unclear exactly how many people in Venezuela have used cryptocurrencies, although a 2018 Cointelegraph report indicates that the country \"already [had] at least several hundred bitcoin enthusiasts\" by October 2014. Interest has grown in the following years, and chain restaurants such as Burger King and Pizza Hut now accept payments in bitcoin or dash. Even the Venezuelan government is attempting to cash in on cryptocurrencies. Although the national Petro cryptocurrency has failed to gain traction, the Venezuelan government has launched a state-run mining pool, as well as a government-owned mining farm, Cointelegraph reported in April 2021. In Venezuela, inflation, capital controls, and an interest in privacy urged investors toward bitcoin. Iran has similarly experienced dramatic inflation on its national currency, with inflation hitting 35% in 2020. Nonetheless, it is a far less extreme inflation rate than that of Venezuela. In Iran, some of the interest in cryptocurrency may have been fueled by the government itself. When inflation more than doubled in the span of just a few months, the government announced plans over the summer to launch a state-run cryptocurrency. Still, investors in Iran had already taken part in the cryptocurrency market in a big way, and President Rouhani urged the government to establish a legal framework in June of 2021. However, the Iranian government has also been wary of Bitcoin's energy usage, and recently enacted a four-month ban on mining. The latest country to show interest in cryptocurrency is El Salvador, where legislators approved a measure that would make bitcoin official legal tender. Unlike most Latin American countries, El Salvador does not have its own currency and relies on U.S. dollars as a medium of exchange. By adopting bitcoin as legal tender, the country hoped to help El Salvador achieve economic independence from the United States. In a speech announcing his proposal, president Nayib Bukele said that bitcoin payments would make it easier for Salvadorans abroad to send money home. On average, Salvadoran expatriates send home nearly $700 million each month, incurring substantial wire transfer fees. Since bitcoin does not have international transfer fees, many advocates believe that it is well-suited for overseas transfers. In order to facilitate bitcoin adoption, the Salvadoran government has partnered with several wallet and ATM providers to install the necessary infrastructure. Many countries have seen increased crypto adoption as a result of local currency crises. Do these and other examples of economically troubled countries experiencing a rise in bitcoin suggest that the digital currency is poised to take over on a global scale?

            "title": "How Do Cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) Work?",
            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) track the price performance of cryptocurrencies by investing in a portfolio linked to their instruments. Like other such funds, crypto ETFs trade on regular stock exchanges, and investors can hold them in their standard brokerage accounts. A growing roster of ETFs\u2014a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)\u2014in early 2024 began offering investors the chance to invest in bitcoin through their holdings. After about a decade of regulatory wrangling, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under pressure from a 2023 D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, authorized the first spot crypto ETFs in early 2024. These investments allow retail traders to gain direct exposure to crypto prices without owning the assets directly. This makes it possible to speculate on cryptocurrency prices without doing business on a crypto exchange or dealing with the costs and complexities of directly owning digital assets. However, crypto ETFs generally have higher fees than other ETFs, and while the funds themselves are regulated, there is no such oversight in the crypto markets where the funds are invested. For example, the SEC has argued that without proper oversight and surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets, it's difficult to prevent fraudulent activities and ensure fair trading practices in the crypto markets. Below, we take you through how these funds work, what worries the SEC still has around these products, what benefits they might have, and what this all means for everyday investors. While most ETFs replicate how indexes work by holding a basket of underlying assets, crypto ETFs have a couple of ways of tracking the performance of a digital currency. Spot ETFs directly hold the cryptocurrency, building a portfolio that replicates the performance of the digital assets it contains. Other crypto ETFs invest in futures contracts, which are agreements to buy or sell crypto at a preset date and price. Given their portfolios, these ETFs have share prices that mimic changes in the price of derivatives instead of the cryptocurrencies themselves. Therefore, the price of shares in a given cryptocurrency ETF rises and falls in line with crypto futures contract prices. Like other derivatives, synthetic cryptocurrency ETFs have an additional risk because of the lack of oversight and valuation concerns in the crypto exchanges from where the funds would be pulling crypto. While U.S. regulators refused to approve crypto ETFs for several years\u2014the SEC turned away some 20 proposals in spot ETFs from 2018 to 2023 alone\u2014they were readily available to investors in Europe and Canada. The SEC approved the first crypto futures ETFs for the U.S. market in October 2021 and the first spot crypto ETFs in January 2024. The first cryptocurrency ETF, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, started trading in October 2021. This is an ETF that tracks bitcoin futures prices. An analysis of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, the first crypto ETF on U.S. markets, shows how crypto futures ETFs work. The fund assigns about half of its portfolio to Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) bitcoin futures that expire at the end of the current month and another half to CME bitcoin futures expiring the following month. As the expiration of the contracts in the portfolio approaches, the fund rolls over its investments, selling the expiring contracts and buying contracts for the coming month. The costs associated with rolling over the contracts may account for some of the differences between the performance of the ETFs and their underlying cryptocurrencies. ProShares also has Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), an ether futures ETF like the one it provides for bitcoin. The fund tracks the price of ether with futures contracts. ProShares has ETFs that track a mix of bitcoin and ether using equal or market-cap weighting for investors looking for exposure to several crypto tokens. There are also inverse ETFs, such as the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF. This uses futures to generate the inverse of bitcoin's returns, allowing investors to profit on days when cryptocurrency prices decline. Investment funds can also directly trade and hold cryptocurrencies. Spot crypto ETFs are funds that buy cryptocurrencies and securitize them. Investors buy and sell shares as needed, just like a traditional ETF. In a spot crypto ETF, the fund can issue and redeem shares, offering retail and other investors a stake in the crypto market. Starting in 2014, asset managers sought approval from the SEC for spot bitcoin ETFs. Between October 2022 and October 2023, the SEC received more than 3,500 crypto-related fund applications. In January 2024, the SEC approved the first 11 spot bitcoin ETFs, opening the door to more spot cryptocurrency ETFs later. In January 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first 11 bitcoin spot ETFs for U.S. markets. On their first trading day, they had about $4.6 billion in trading volume. In May 2024, the SEC also started to pave the way for spot ether ETFs. The SEC approved a rule change that would allow for the listing and trading of eight spot ether ETFs. Prior to this approval, the SEC expressed concerns about Ethereum's staking feature and its previous worries with bitcoin for fraud, volatility, and low investor protections in crypto markets. \"Staking,\" which allows ether holders to earn income by locking up their tokens to help validate transactions on the network, is a crucial feature of Ethereum's consensus mechanism. This income-generating feature, which began on the ether platform in 2022, raises questions about how staking rewards should be taxed and reported. This gave the SEC another reason to be reluctant to approve spot ether ETFs, given the lack of regulatory clarity about their tax status. Note that the SEC's approval of a rule change for spot ether ETFs does not mean that these ETFs can start trading. Applications from the investment managers need to be reviewed and further approvals need to be given. Cryptocurrency ETFs are a developing asset class, and given the regulatory uncertainty, the market may look different in the future. Nevertheless, owning shares in cryptocurrency ETFs has some advantages when accessing the crypto markets. The most significant benefit of cryptocurrency ETFs is that they provide exposure to crypto without additional ownership expenses or exposure to the risk of owning and holding them in a crypto wallet. For example, there are custody charges for cryptocurrencies, and some secure digital wallets charge an annual fee. These charges can add up quickly. Cryptocurrencies also come with transaction and network fees, which the ETF providers take care of, even if you pay indirectly through the fund's expense ratio. Cryptocurrency jargon, derived mostly from its technological makeup, is still a roadblock to crypto adoption. Average investors often find it difficult to grasp the scope and roles of cryptocurrencies. Plus, these investors might be unfamiliar with networking technology, making crypto-speak, such as halving and blockchain, even more disinviting. Investing in a cryptocurrency ETF makes learning enough to get into crypto much more manageable. Cryptocurrency exchanges, storage devices, wallets, and some poorly designed blockchains have been hacked since they were launched, leading to constant worries in the crypto world about security. Cryptocurrency security can be a tall order for individual investors, who may not be familiar with the required methods. A cryptocurrency ETF takes care of this for you. There are more than 9,000 cryptocurrencies available in trading markets worldwide as of January 2024. The infrastructure to buy and sell them is becoming more sound, but it's still relatively untamed territory compared with securities exchanges. For example, some tokens are available on certain cryptocurrency exchanges while others are not, and exchanges can operate in some countries but not others. There are also extra costs that come with buying crypto. Cryptocurrency ETFs allow you to diversify your holdings without the fees and hassles of buying and exchanging the tokens yourself. The novelty of cryptocurrency ETFs is one of its drawbacks, not least since it's still unknown how regulations in this area will evolve. Given the likelihood that more crypto ETFs will emerge, it's important to be aware of their potential issues. Crypto ETFs do not always duplicate the price moves of the underlying digital token. This is especially true for ETFs that depend on futures contracts to track cryptocurrencies, which have to roll over their positions as contracts expire. While crypto ETFs help investors avoid some costs of directly owning digital currencies, they have their own fees. Since they are often actively managed, crypto ETFs can have higher expense ratios than other ETFs. For example, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF's expense ratio is 0.95%. For comparison, the expense ratio for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF is just 0.09%. Although cryptocurrency ETFs simplify some of what's involved in trading digital currencies, they are still subject to the dramatic price swings of the crypto markets. This means more risk for you, which can be even more worrying if you are more accustomed to the lower volatility of more typical ETFs. Investors in crypto ETFs are not the owners of the digital assets. While crypto ETFs do bring convenience, you won't have control or access to the cryptocurrency itself, and the decentralization and anonymity associated with crypto don't apply to ETF shareholders. Trade on stock exchanges using regular brokerage accounts Provide exposure to crypto without direct ownership Avoid crypto custody and trading expenses Reduce the learning curve Regulatory uncertainty Elevated fees and expenses Subject to volatility in crypto markets No direct ownership or control over underlying cryptocurrency. In addition to allocating funds to futures and spot ETFs, investors can put their money into several other ETF-like products for crypto exposure. Let's dig into these options. While the SEC has only reluctantly approved a handful of crypto ETFs, a similar product has already been available for years: bitcoin investment trusts. These are closed-end funds that resemble the spot crypto ETFs being proposed. They own bitcoins on behalf of investors, and their shares trade in over-the-counter (OTC) markets. But these are not ETFs. They are open only to investment firms, accredited investors, or high-net-worth individuals and are not accessible to the retail public. They tend to have a high minimum investment amount, and each purchase of shares is accompanied by a lockup period for investors. ETFs are one variety of exchange-traded products (ETP). Crypto ETPs, when discussed, refer, however, to those that specifically hold debt securities issued by special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that hold the underlying crypto assets. The SPV uses the crypto as collateral to issue the ETPs, which are traded on exchanges. Crypto ETPs fall under the Securities Act of 1933 and are less regulated than ETFs. Spot Crypto ETPs, in other words, are not investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of ETF shares. Another difference is that crypto ETFs can create and redeem shares based on market demand, helping the share price align with the fund's net asset value. Crypto ETPs typically have a fixed supply of shares that trade at market-based prices which can deviate from the underlying crypto value. Investing in companies that hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheet is another way to invest in crypto without owning the digital tokens. Some publicly listed companies hold a large number of bitcoins. For example, MicroStrategy (MSTR) owned about 214,000 bitcoins as of May 2024. Galaxy Digital Holdings (BRPHF) and Tesla (TSLA) are other publicly listed companies with bitcoins on their balance sheets. Plenty of ETFs offer diversified exposure to companies that engage with blockchain technology or crypto companies. For example, the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) holds a portfolio of companies that develop and use blockchain technologies. Crypto ETFs are designed to mimic the assets so investors can gain exposure to significant price fluctuations. However, because prices vary so much, there is more risk involved in crypto ETFs. If you're considering adding these to your portfolio, speaking with a financial advisor about your specific circumstances and goals is always the prudent choice. The tax implications for crypto ETFs often differ from directly holding cryptocurrency. In many jurisdictions, crypto ETF gains are treated like capital gains, which can be more favorable than the tax treatment for direct cryptocurrency transactions. Consulting a tax advisor about your specific circumstances is always prudent in cases like this. There are a few cryptocurrency index funds, such as the Bitwise 10 (BITW) or Galaxy Crypto Index Fund. These funds are only available to non-U.S. investors or in the U.S. to accredited investors. Yes, you can short a crypto ETF, as you can with any ETF. Shorting allows you to gain from the decline in an asset's price. This strategy, especially in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, involves elevated risks and potentially unlimited losses, so it's crucial to understand the dangers before going ahead. ETFs are a retail investor-friendly way to gain exposure to assets that might otherwise be too costly. Brokers want to offer ETFs that hold cryptocurrency so that average investors can participate in cryptocurrency investing. However, these funds tend to come with additional risks and expenses, so it is important to research them thoroughly before making an investment decision.

            "title": "The Largest Cryptocurrency Hacks So Far",
            "content": "One of the obstacles to the mainstream adoption of\u00a0digital currency\u00a0has been hacking. Some high-profile thefts have occurred on various cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms, deterring investors from using them. It has been argued that blockchain projects are secure, but attacks over the years have demonstrated that this is only partially true. Over $1.7 billion in cryptocurrency was stolen in 2023 ($3.8 billion in 2022), according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis.\u00a0Take a look at some of the largest crypto hacks to date. The largest cryptocurrency hack to date was conducted in March 2022 and targeted the network that supports the popular Axie Infinity blockchain gaming platform. Hackers breached the Ronin Network and made off with around $625 million worth of Ether and USDC (a stablecoin). Investigators said that a North Korean state-backed hacking collective, the Lazarus Group, was linked to the theft. Sky Mavis (Axie Infinity's developer) recovered $5.7 million of the stolen funds a month later, but it remains the largest cryptocurrency hack in history. In August 2021, a lone hacker pounced on a vulnerability in the Poly Network decentralized finance platform and made off with over $600 million. The project\u2019s developers issued an appeal on X (formerly Twitter) for the stolen funds, which included $33 million Tether. The Poly Network then established several addresses for the funds to be returned to, and the unknown hacker began cooperating. After only two days, around $300 million had been recovered, and it emerged that the hacker had targeted the network \u201cfor fun\u201d or as a challenge. In one of the most high-profile attacks in cryptocurrency history, the Binance exchange was hacked for about $570 million in October 2022. A cross-chain bridge, BSC Token Hub, was exploited by hackers, who created and withdrew 2 million extra Binance Coins (BNB). A bug in a smart contract enabled the hack, highlighting the need for tighter blockchain security. The amount of cryptocurrency stolen from exchanges and other platforms in 2023, down from 2022's $3.8 billion. In January 2018, the Japanese exchange\u00a0Coincheck\u00a0suffered a theft of $523 million\u00a0NEM\u00a0coins valued at about $534 million. The vulnerability was created by a hot wallet, which is a live cryptocurrency wallet and not as safe as an offline cold storage wallet. At the time, the Coincheck hack was larger even than the notorious\u00a0Mt. Gox\u00a0hack; NEM Foundation president Lon Wong described it at the time as \"the biggest theft in the history of the world.\" Coincheck survived the hack and continued operating despite being bought out a few months later by the Japanese financial services company Monex Group. In November 2022, FTX, at one time an influential player in the crypto industry,\u00a0declared bankruptcy.\u00a0On the day it filed for\u00a0Chapter 11\u00a0bankruptcy, more than\u00a0$477 million was stolen\u00a0from its crypto wallets. Many FTX wallet holders reported $0 balances in their\u00a0FTX.com\u00a0and FTX US wallets. The crypto exchange confirmed the hack on its Telegram channel, saying, ''FTX has been hacked. FTX apps are malware. Delete them. Chat is open. Don't go to the FTX site as it might download Trojans.'' In 2024, reports emerged about the arrest of a SIM card swapping ring that gained access to an FTX employee's accounts and siphoned off millions in crypto. The first major crypto hack occurred in 2011 when the crypto exchange Mt. Gox lost 25,000 bitcoins worth approximately $400,000. At that time, the crypto exchange handled nearly 70% of all Bitcoin transactions. The attacks didn't stop, and Mt. Gox was hit again in 2014. It lost almost 650,000 of its customers' bitcoins and about 100,000 of its own. At the time, that was 7% of all bitcoins and was worth approximately $473 million. Initial reasons for the coins' disappearance were unclear, but later evidence showed that the coins were stolen from the company's hot wallet. The decentralized finance platform Wormhole was targeted in February 2022, with $325 million taken by hackers. The attack had been made possible by an upgrade to the project's GitHub repository, which was not then deployed to the live project. The popular cryptocurrency bridge had to plug the hole in the project's finances after the funds were not recovered. This was also the largest theft that included Solana, one of the rivals to Ethereum's dominance in the worlds of DeFi and NFTs. Up to $47 million was taken in the blockchain's native SOL token. Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin was attacked in May 2024, resulting in a theft of 4,500 BTC (about $305 million at the time). How the exchange was hacked remains unknown as of Nov. 2, 2024, but the Lazarus Group is again thought to be behind the theft. The Mixin Network is a peer-to-peer, cross-chain network that facilitates cryptocurrency transfers. In September 2023, the network was hacked through the database of its cloud service provider. Thieves made off with about $200 million worth of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and tether (USDT). Euler Finance is a borrowing and lending protocol platform based on the Ethereum blockchain. On March 13, 2023, hackers conducted a flash loan attack, grabbing $197 million in wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), DAI (a MakerDOA stablecoin), staked ether (stETH), and USDC. A flash loan attack occurs when a hacker uses a flash loan\u2014a loan without collateral that must be paid in full in the same transaction, often used by traders in arbitrage\u2014to withdraw massive amounts, letting the thieves manipulate prices. However, in a strange twist, the hacker(s) began returning the stolen funds in increments several days later, citing concerns over their safety. December 2021 saw a hack of the Bitmart centralized exchange with losses of $196 million. The hack was first spotted by a security analysis firm, which noted BitMart addresses being drained of their balance. Around $100 million in various cryptocurrencies were funneled via Ethereum, with another $96 million exiting through Binance Smart Chain. All the tokens were moved to an address labeled by Etherscan as the \"BitMart Hacker.\" Only one month before the Wintermute breach, there was a more significant hack: an attack on Nomad Bridge. The hackers drained $190 million of the project\u2019s funds. Nomad is a cryptocurrency bridge that lets users swap tokens between blockchains. Bridges are one of the latest hacker favorites due to the considerable value of their assets and the complexity of the smart contract code on which they run. Nomad Bridge later recovered $37 million of the stolen funds. This hack involved the exploitation of a\u00a0decentralized finance\u00a0(DeFi) platform using a flash loan. After borrowing $2.5 billion in different assets, the hacker took a 67% controlling stake in the project and approved a transfer of funds to their wallet before repaying the loan and disappearing with the profits. Wintermute, a leading cryptocurrency\u00a0market maker, was attacked in September 2022. The\u00a0project lost about $160 million\u00a0in the hack, which made things worse for Wintermute because it owed $200 million to other market participants. The CEO offered a 10% bounty to the hacker if they returned the funds. Multichain claimed to be a cross-chain router protocol, which theoretically would allow nearly all blockchains to communicate with each other and transfer assets across them\u2014something that was and is needed for Web 3 to continue progressing. Multichain's CEO, Zhaojun, was reportedly arrested in China and disappeared, leading analysts to believe the theft was the result of a rug pull, where system owners/developers create a product, attract funds, and suddenly leave with the money. Many cryptocurrencies have been hacked, such as Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, Bitcoin Gold, and Ethereum Classic. Monero remains one of the most secretive cryptocurrencies in terms of traceability. Its developers pride themselves on making it nearly impossible to trace. In fact, updates to the Monero blockchain will further decrease the odds of discovering transaction participants. New projects release \"free\" tokens all the time in airdrops and promotions, but these should be approached with caution as they tend to be used in scams. That said, nothing in life is free, especially cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency industry has grown rapidly since the mid-2010s and may even be advancing too fast, as the number of hacks and thefts demonstrate exploitable weaknesses. Continuous hacks have exposed the vulnerability of the crypto industry and undermined investors' confidence. To avoid further damage to sentiment, developers and businesses need to exercise more caution and implement more security protocols for blockchain networks and supporting systems.

            "title": "Top Cryptocurrency Myths",
            "content": "Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups. Cryptocurrencies have experienced significant growth in popularity since they were first introduced in 2009. They are somewhat obscure in nature and difficult to understand; this confusion brings about many myths and rumors\u00a0regarding these digital currencies. In no particular order, here are some of the most common cryptocurrency myths, accompanied by an examination of facts to help you decide whether there is any truth or falsehood to them.  One of the oldest and most pervasive myths about digital currencies is that they are most commonly used for illicit activity. While it's true that digital currencies have been used by individuals with nefarious goals in mind, as well as by criminal organizations, the same could be said of any form of money used throughout history. According to Chainalysis\u2014a company that assists investigators in cryptocurrency crimes with blockchain data analysis\u2014the number of cryptocurrency transactions related to illicit activities fell in 2021 to 0.15% of all cryptocurrency transactions. Out of this small number, 82% consisted of cryptocurrency scams. In 2023, crypto crime increased to 0.34% of all transactions, an increase from 2021 but a decrease from 2022. Even though crypto crime has doubled since 2021, it still remains a very small minority of on-chain transactions. Most cryptocurrency transactions are conducted with legitimate and legal intentions. It's important to note that governments and the international community are cracking down on cryptocurrency use by criminals and organized crime. Many countries have adopted cryptocurrency anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism measures; agencies and teams have been established to combat the use of cryptocurrencies in these illegal activities. For instance, in the U.S., the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section's (CCIPS) National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) investigates and prosecutes criminal cryptocurrency uses. The CCIPS is part of the Department of Justice. Value is a subjective concept\u2014a person, community, or society may place value on an object that another puts in the recycle bin. For example, the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was valued shortly after its launch in 2009 at thousandths of a cent. Its popularity continued to rise, and in 2021, it reached $69,000 per Bitcoin, then reached $77,000 on a cryptocurrency exchange in Poland in 2024. Its rise in value demonstrates that the way an asset is perceived by society is essential in establishing whether it has value. Ethereum, the blockchain ecosystem that powers the cryptocurrency ether (ETH), is the building block for non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance applications, and other technological advancements in digital asset ownership. ETH may not have the dollar value that Bitcoin does, but its utility and potential give much more value to a company developing financial products and services that use the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. Investors and enterprises have begun holding cryptocurrencies for use in finance, investment, venture capital, and other areas. For example, Galaxy Digital Holdings is a financial service and investment company with more than $2.0 billion in crypto (digital) assets under management as of the first quarter of 2024. Cryptocurrency dollar value appears to fluctuate following consumer and investor sentiments, supply, demand, and economic circumstances\u2014similar to many other assets or currencies. The key technology behind cryptocurrency is the blockchain. A blockchain is a distributed database secured with encryption techniques and technology that is very difficult to break. As transactions are entered into the blocks in the blockchain, previous transaction information is recorded in the new blocks and encrypted. The chain continues to build on each previous block, and a community of automated verifiers has to agree that the information recorded in the transactions is valid. Here's where blockchains can be insecure: on a proof-of-work blockchain like Bitcoin, the network must be large and fast enough to prevent someone from introducing an altered version. So far, this has not been a problem for Bitcoin, but other, smaller blockchains have been taken over. On Ethereum, which uses proof-of-stake, validators must offer up valuable cryptocurrency as collateral for honest work or risk losing it. This is very expensive, as it takes 32 ether (about $95,000 as of July 5, 2024 prices) to become a node that can propose blocks. Blockchains that do not use expensive collateral might be at risk of attack. There are other types of consensus mechanisms in use, but their security all depends on the network design and whether they are widely adopted and used. Another security weakness lies in how cryptocurrency is accessed and stored, such as in cryptocurrency wallets or centralized exchanges that facilitate transactions. It is entirely possible to send cryptocurrency from one user to another without worry, but the platforms and software used to store and access it can be hacked or tampered with. There are some very safe methods you can use to secure your cryptocurrency. For instance, you can keep your crypto asset keys off the exchanges and in cold storage. When you want to use it, transfer only the amount you want to use to your hot wallet through a secure, wired connection on a non-mobile device like a personal computer. There is good reason to be concerned about the impact digital currencies have on the environment. Some cryptocurrencies employ a consensus mechanism that uses computational power and large amounts of energy to verify and validate transactions. One token, Bitcoin, has become more popular and valuable as time has passed; large mining operations emerged to take advantage of the rise in popularity and corner the crypto-mining market. Each of these mining farms requires massive amounts of energy to power the mining rigs, adding up to a total network energy consumption equaling that of some small countries. However, the environmental impact greatly depends upon the source of energy the mining operations are drawing upon and the impact their energy use has on the power grid. If the mining operations are drawing most of their electricity from fossil-fuel-powered grids, then the impact is excess carbon pollution for an intangible-yet-valuable item whose future and benefits to humanity are uncertain. On the other hand, if mining operations are powered mostly by sustainable energy, the environmental impact is lower. In both cases, the large energy use places a strain on grids. Not all cryptocurrencies use energy-intensive mining for validation. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are ever-evolving, and some are taking steps to reduce their environmental footprints. Bitcoin mining operators have also purchased previously shut-down fossil fuel plants to power their operations. This raises new concerns for environmentalists and countries struggling to reduce their carbon footprints. Cryptocurrencies have become an accepted means of exchange at many retailers and merchants. People are accepting them in personal transactions, and governments are working to find ways to regulate them. Most cryptocurrencies have no programming, code, or malicious artificial intent that works to take money from you. However, people have created scams to try and trick you out of your cryptocurrency or money. For example, there have been many unregistered initial coin offerings\u2014unregulated fundraising for new cryptocurrency ventures\u2014that turned out to be scams. In other cryptocurrency scams, someone might try to get you to accept unverified transactions or call you pretending to be government officials and ask you to pay your debts in cryptocurrency. You can find information about cryptocurrency and other scams on the Federal Trade Commission's Consumer Information website. While it's impossible to eliminate the chance that you will be the victim of a scam, knowledge and awareness can help you reduce the chances of it happening to you. The International Monetary Fund defines money as a store of value, unit of account, or medium of exchange that is widely accepted and can be translated into prices. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) defines cryptocurrency as a digital representation of a stored value through cryptography. The Internal Revenue Service views cryptocurrency as \"convertible\" currency\u2014one that has an equal value in \"real\" currency. Transactions in cryptocurrency are taxed, and capital gains or losses from holding them must be reported on your tax filings. Many vendors accept Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), and other cryptocurrencies in exchange for products\u2014you can also exchange your crypto for legal tender at many cryptocurrency exchanges. Cryptocurrencies may not have a physical form, but they are used as money in many areas. You can even find Bitcoin ATMs in many cities. Whether an asset is legal tender does not influence whether financial authorities and regulators consider it money. Cryptocurrencies are relatively new, while fiat currencies have been around for centuries. China is generally thought to have issued the first fiat currency around the year 1,000 CE. Many developed countries use this type of currency. For cryptocurrency to replace fiat currency, people would have to adopt it en masse over the money they are used to and can understand. However, once value and purchasing power are established, it is possible that it could happen. If merchants began posting prices in cryptocurrency and more people began using it to purchase goods and services, it might start a trend. However, governments and officials will not let go of fiat currency lightly because of the established system of controls in place for collecting taxes and funding government-sponsored programs and services. Without the collection of taxes, social programs that people depend upon will disappear, and other government funding could dry up. If cryptocurrency became fiat's replacement, it is unclear how its inflationary trends could be accelerated or slowed\u2014it could take decades to find solutions. Moreover, there would be no way to control inflation through monetary policies due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency. The modern tools used by central banks to combat inflation and unemployment while boosting economic growth have taken over 100 years to develop. The complete decentralization of money through cryptocurrency would have unknown effects on a country's economy. Because blockchain technology and cryptocurrency do not have any built-in tools for influencing inflation, employment, or economic growth, new monetary policies and tools would need to be created. At one time, computers, the internet, and email were considered interesting only to a small crowd of tech fans\u2014they are now staples of modern personal and work life. It is tough to predict where cryptocurrencies will be in the next few decades; however, the technology they introduced and the products they inspired will likely continue to be developed and refined. Decentralized finance applications are taking shape, gathering the interest of financial institutions and consumers. Governments are exploring ways to implement legally recognized cryptocurrencies pegged to their fiat currencies, and some businesses are investing heavily in Bitcoin and altcoins. Tech giants are researching ways to fuse the real and digital worlds, using blockchain technology as a building block for this fusion with non-fungible tokens created for anything imaginable. Tokens can be created for any asset and value assigned to them; the virtual and real worlds are being directed onto a collision course, and cryptocurrency is likely to be involved. Cryptocurrency can provide anonymity, which attracts users with illicit intentions. However, most cryptocurrency transactions are made by honest users. In November 2022, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX declared bankruptcy after analysts discovered fraudulent activity within the organization. The investigation that followed revealed the largest financial fraud scheme in recorded history, with at least $8 billion in losses to customers, investors, and lenders. Cryptocurrency is new, even though the concept has existed since the beginning of the century. Because of this (and the fact that it is rather complicated to understand), consumer and investor protection regulations have not fully caught up. There are many myths regarding cryptocurrency because it is such an abstract and new idea. In time, many of these myths will be debunked or verified as more people begin to understand what cryptocurrency is and how the concepts behind it can benefit society.

She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. A complementary currency is any currency or exchange medium that is not a national currency\u00a0but is accepted for use under specific conditions in a nation. A complementary currency\u00a0is not intended to be used as the primary means of exchange in an economy; it is set up by private citizens, advocacy groups, or public regulatory bodies to create parallel markets for specific goods and services or within a specific geographic region. The goal of a complementary currency is to regulate a local or regional economy or achieve a particular social, environmental, or political purpose. Complementary currencies are not intended to replace a nation's fiat or national currency. Depending on the type of complementary currency, there are several distinct disadvantages compared to a national currency, including the fact that they may be limited in terms of usage and, depending on the issuing process, prone to volatility and inflation. Instead of offering a true alternative currency, most complementary currencies have social or local economic goals that are limited in scope. One of the most famous examples of a complementary currency is BerkShares. BerkShares are a local currency that can only be used in the Berkshire region of Massachusetts. Set up as an experiment by a nonprofit organization to encourage local spending\u00a0and investment, there are now more than 300 businesses that accept BerkShares as a form of payment. BerkShares are sometimes called a community currency, which can be considered a sub-category within complementary currencies. Community currencies are complementary currencies that are explicitly aimed at supporting a local or regional economy and its goals. While not specifically labeled or designed to be used as a currency, cap-and-trade systems for regulating carbon are similar to complementary currencies as they can have value that can be transferred. The European government, for example, issues carbon credits that companies purchase for the ability to emit carbon legally. A market has grown for selling excess credits between industries. Regulators work to set the price of this currency so that it encourages companies to reduce their carbon emissions in line with government targets. Complementary currencies can also be time- or skills-based and, in effect, form a barter system or direct community efforts to areas of great need. The Fureai Kippu system is a type of complementary currency started in Japan. \"Fureai Kippu\" can be roughly translated as \"ticket for a caring relationship.\" Participants earn an electronic currency for every hour of labor they spend helping an older adult. Credit is then held in an online\u00a0clearinghouse\u00a0and can be redeemed when the participant is in need of care themselves (or passed on to someone else who needs it). The Fureai Kippu system was first introduced in 1995 to address Japan's aging population. Now, hundreds of institutions participate in the system and accept the credits, and the system has spread to other countries in Asia with aging populations. The terms complementary currency and alternative currency are often used interchangeably, but they differ somewhat in that alternative currencies are generally defined as mediums of exchange other than fiat currencies; complementary currencies are created to advance the social or economic goals of a community, group, or organization. According to some, Bitcoin, as a payment method, meets both definitions. Bitcoin has been used to finance journalistic freedom and as a payment method in war-torn areas where traditional banking was unavailable. It is also highly used in remittances, where people work in one country and send money to family in another. Bitcoin is accepted by businesses globally, and there are even Bitcoin ATMs worldwide. It addresses social and economic needs and is recognized as a medium of exchange in nearly every country. However, there are arguments against Bitcoin meeting the definition of either type of currency. To this side, there is no longer a unifying goal other than to act as a currency free from the influence of central banks or to hold on to it as an investment. So, to some, Bitcoin doesn't fit the definition of a complementary currency anymore, and possibly not that of an alternative currency. The belief is that even if it was part of a greater ideological goal in the past, its real-world uses have been diminished because it is used more to advance a wide range of agendas. Whichever side of the argument you fall on, it's important to note that discussions about the broader applications of crypto have created an opportunity for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to position themselves as accepted forms of complementary currencies in the future. Interestingly, coca-base (the extract from the coca leaf) is used in villages in Columbia where there is a shortage of official currency. A not-so-extreme example is Berkshares, a currency used in the Berkshire area of Massachusets. Alternative currency is any medium of exchange that is not government-issued currency. Value is established by whoever is using the alternative currency, so the exchange of cigarettes between inmates in a prison system for items or services represents an alternative currency. It depends on the context behind the question. If the question is which country's currency can replace the dollar, no one knows. But if the question is what an alternative currency to the dollar is, cryptocurrency might be the answer. Complementary currencies are currencies or mediums of exchange considered to be complementing the official currency of a country. They are usually designed with a social or local economic incentive in mind but do not take the place of an official government-recognized and backed currency.
