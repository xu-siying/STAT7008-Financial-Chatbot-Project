The best personal loans offer quick cash at a low cost with manageable repayment terms. After conducting rigorous research on 59 personal loan lenders, we\u2019ve chosen LightStream as our top pick for the best personal loans. The lender offers some of the lowest rates, largest loans, and longest repayment terms in the industry, and you\u2019ll never have to worry about fees. But LightStream won\u2019t be the best choice for everyone, including people with fair credit. Learn about our other top picks below. The best personal loans offer quick cash at a low cost with manageable repayment terms. After conducting rigorous research on 59 personal loan lenders, we\u2019ve chosen LightStream as our top pick for the best personal loans. The lender offers some of the lowest rates, largest loans, and longest repayment terms in the industry, and you\u2019ll never have to worry about fees. But LightStream won\u2019t be the best choice for everyone, including people with fair credit. Learn about our other top picks below. LightStream offers personal loans with low rates and no fees of any kind\u2014not even late fees\u2014and will beat another lender\u2019s rate on an unsecured loan. You can choose a repayment term between two and seven years for most purposes, with terms up to 20 years available for some loan types, and LightStream can issue the funds as soon as the same day. LightStream offers large personal loans up to $100,000 with long repayment terms ideal for paying off a large balance. Only BHG Financial offers larger loans (up to $200,000) than LightStream. Very low starting APRs Loan amounts up to $100,000 Terms up to 20 years for select loan types No fees of any kind Funding as soon as the same day $5,000 minimum loan amount No option to pre-qualify without credit damage Requires good or excellent credit Doesn\u2019t allow due date changes For borrowers with good or excellent credit, LightStream checks all the boxes. The lender offers large loan amounts, doesn\u2019t charge fees of any kind, and has some of the lowest rates of any online lender. LightStream will even beat another lender\u2019s rate by 0.10 percentage points if you find a better offer at least two days prior to funding. For most loan types, you can choose a repayment term between two and seven years, and the lender offers terms of up to 20 years with some loan types. You can use a LightStream personal loan for a variety of purposes, including buying a vehicle\u2014the lender doesn\u2019t require a down payment or place any restrictions on the vehicle, making LightStream\u2019s unsecured personal loans a good option for people buying a used car that doesn\u2019t meet traditional auto loan requirements. However, unlike some personal loans, you can\u2019t use a LightStream personal loan for business purposes. Funding is fast, with same-day wire transfers available to borrowers who accept a loan offer before 2:30 p.m. ET, and LightStream plants a tree for every loan it funds. However, LightStream only approves borrowers with good and excellent credit, and there\u2019s no option to pre-qualify without a hard credit check. If you apply, your credit score will dip slightly, even if you\u2019re ultimately denied. Good credit doesn\u2019t guarantee approval, since the lender also considers your income and existing debts. However, the lender does allow co-applicants and will evaluate each applicant\u2019s financial information equally. So, applying with your spouse or another family member who has a high credit score can increase your approval odds. LightStream is part of Truist Bank, which was formed from a merger between BB&T and SunTrust Bank in 2019 and is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. Like LightStream, SoFi offers loan amounts up to $100,000 with no origination fee and may be a good alternative if you want the option to pre-qualify. SoFi also offers generous member benefits like free financial advice. Origination fee is optional No late fees Same-day funding available Access to SoFi membership benefits No secured loan options Can\u2019t apply with a co-signer, but co-borrowers are accepted High minimum loan amounts While lower-rate personal loans do exist, SoFi is the most affordable lender offering a good blend of options plus some nice extras. SoFi is one of the few lenders to offer a comprehensive benefits package with all of its loans, including free financial planning from an advisor as well as career counseling and support. Borrowers seem to approve of this approach, rating SoFi as the fourth-best in J.D. Power\u2019s annual survey of customer satisfaction among personal loan lenders. SoFi also has excellent customer reviews on Trustpilot. The biggest downside of borrowing with SoFi is that with a minimum loan amount of $5,000, borrowers looking for a smaller loan are left out. And while you can apply with a co-borrower, SoFi doesn\u2019t offer the option to apply with a co-signer or use collateral if you\u2019re not able to be approved otherwise. SoFi was founded in 2011 and is based in San Francisco. It has funded more than $73 billion in loans of various types, including student loans and personal loans. Discover offers debt consolidation loans with low rates and flexible terms, and you can choose to have the lender pay your creditors directly. Using a Discover personal loan to pay off higher-interest debt can even earn you a lower rate than you would otherwise qualify for. No origination fee Excellent customer satisfaction ratings Can send payment to creditors directly Only accepts individual applications Can\u2019t use collateral for a secured loan Can\u2019t be used for secured debt consolidation A Discover personal loan is an excellent choice for debt consolidation as long as you\u2019re not using the funds to pay off a secured loan, which the lender doesn\u2019t allow. You also can\u2019t opt for direct payment of a Discover credit card, but Discover can pay many other creditors directly. The lender offers a fast funding time with a next-business-day deposit into your bank account if everything goes smoothly, and its low rates with zero origination fees make it easier to pay back. Discover also allows you to change your due date up to twice during the term, and the lender\u2019s repayment assistance program can help during times of financial hardship. It was ranked as the second-best personal loan option in 2024 by J.D. Power. The downside is that you can only apply as a solo applicant, although you are able to use your household income on your application, so a partner or other family member can still help you out in this area. You can\u2019t apply with a co-signer or co-borrower or use collateral for a Discover loan, however, meaning you\u2019ll need to qualify on your own credit merits. It\u2019s always a good idea to pay on time to avoid damaging your credit. But in this case, it\u2019s especially important given that Discover charges a very high late payment fee of $39. Discover was founded in 1986 as a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Company offering credit card services. It is headquartered in Riverwoods, Illinois, and has funded $10 billion in personal loans. Once you\u2019re approved for a personal loan from Upgrade, the lender will send the funds directly to your bank account within one business day. Though LightStream and SoFi both offer same-day funding, Upgrade is willing to work with fair credit borrowers, making it our top pick for emergency loans. Multiple discount options $200 checking account bonus offer Allows joint applications May offer auto-secured loan options Expensive origination fee High interest rate for some applicants Upgrade accepts applicants with fair credit scores, and if you still don\u2019t qualify or want lower rates, you can apply with a co-applicant. Upgrade may also offer you the opportunity to secure the loan using your vehicle as collateral if the lender determines you\u2019d benefit. If you\u2019re approved, you can receive your loan funds as soon as the next business day. You do pay a price for that convenience, however. Each personal loan comes with an origination fee ranging from 1.85% to 9.99%, an expensive fee considering many lenders don\u2019t charge anything at all. On the other hand, Upgrade does offer rate discounts if you sign up for autopay or a debt consolidation loan, and it offers a $200 sign-up bonus if you open and use a new Upgrade checking account when you take out your loan. Upgrade is headquartered in San Francisco. It has provided more than $31 billion in loans and credit since 2016. Upstart uses an AI underwriting model that results in increased approval rates at lower interest rates. Anyone with a source of income and a credit score of at least 300 is encouraged to apply. Upstart even accepts college students and graduates with no credit history. Low minimum credit score Fast funding Good loan amount flexibility May require a high origination fee High APRs for some borrowers Fewer loan term options than others For borrowers with credit scores in the \"bad\" or \"poor\" range\u2014between 300 and 579\u2014finding a loan is not easy. Loans those borrowers do find usually come with APRs in the high double or triple digits. Upstart has the lowest minimum credit score of any lender on our list. It will consider applicants who don't even have sufficient credit history to produce a score. For those who do have a score, different Upstart partners have different minimums, offering credit access to the full spectrum of credit profiles. You can borrow up to $50,000, and, if approved, your loan funds can be disbursed in as little as one day. Rates won't go higher than 35.99%. Even if you have no credit history, you can still be eligible for a loan if you are enrolled in or graduated from a degree program. Upstart has made more than $35 billion in loans of various types, including personal loans, available to borrowers. It is headquartered in San Mateo, California, and was founded in 2012. Of the big banks we evaluated based on factors like cost and customer satisfaction, Citibank earned the highest score. The bank offers a low maximum APR and same-day funding for Citibank account holders. If you live near a Citibank branch, you can get in-person assistance with your application. APRs capped at 20.49% No fees of any kind Flexible repayment terms up to 5 years High J.D. Power ranking High starting APRs Lower loan limits than other lenders Can\u2019t use to consolidate Citi credit card debt Citibank doesn\u2019t charge an origination fee, late fees, or hidden fees of any kind, and the lender has a relatively low maximum APR. However, bear in mind that defaulting on your personal loan will result in a 2.00% APR increase. If you\u2019re a Citibank customer, you can get the funds deposited directly into your Citi account as soon as the same business day, but you'll have to wait two business days if you want the funds deposited in a non-Citi account. Existing Citigold and Citi Priority customers also qualify for a relationship discount. Citibank personal loans can be used for almost anything, with the exception of college tuition and business expenses. You also can\u2019t use the funds to pay off Citi credit cards. Some borrowers may appreciate the option to apply at a local branch and get support from a loan officer. Citi has branches in six major cities and across most of California. The bank ranks third in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study. Citibank was founded in 1812 as City Bank of New York and is headquartered in New York City. If you need a small loan for $500 or less, check the options at your local credit union. Most local credit unions offer $250 personal loans, and many also offer no-credit-check loan programs. Lake Michigan Credit Union is an example of a regional credit union that offers low minimum borrowing amounts and low maximum APRs. Small loan amounts Low minimum credit score No upfront fees Credit life and disability insurance available Option to skip a monthly payment for $25 No pre-qualification Membership required Lake Michigan Credit Union (LMCU) earns the nod for best small loan lender because it offers personal loans as small as $250\u2014the smallest in our database. Many competitors have loan amounts starting between $500 and $2,000, and a few offer loans under $500, so you have some options, depending on the size of your need. LMCU also offers competitive APRs and doesn\u2019t charge origination fees, helping to keep your borrowing costs down. If an unexpected expense throws a wrench in your budget, you can also skip a regular payment for a low $25 fee up to twice per year. LMCU\u2019s minimum required credit score of about 650 makes its loans accessible to borrowers with fair credit, and you can also apply with a co-applicant if you need help getting approved. However, LMCU doesn\u2019t offer pre-qualification, which means you can\u2019t see your rate and term without completing a formal application (with a slight downward nudge to your credit score). And because it\u2019s a credit union, you\u2019ll need to become a member before borrowing, although membership is easy to get\u2014if you don\u2019t live, work, or worship in Florida or Michigan\u2019s lower peninsula, you can qualify by donating $5 to the ALS Foundation. LMCU was founded in 1933 and today has over $14 billion in assets and more than 600,000 members. It\u2019s the largest financial institution headquartered in West Michigan. If you\u2019re an eligible military member, it\u2019s well worth joining Navy Federal Credit Union to access personal loans with low rates, no upfront fees, and same-day funding in most cases. You can choose from a wide range of loan amounts and repayment terms, including extended terms on home improvement loans of $30,000 or more. Same-day funding Second-highest J.D. Power rating Wide range of loan amounts and terms Allows co-applicants Not available to most civilians Doesn\u2019t offer pre-qualification No online application for some loan types Navy Federal offers personal loans with excellent features. Aside from the wide range of term lengths and loan amounts to choose from, there are no origination fees, and rates start at just 8.99%. You can even get a repayment term of up to 180 months on a large personal loan for home improvement. Navy Federal also received the second-highest satisfaction score for personal loans in J.D. Power\u2019s 2024 study (unofficially, as it does not meet all of J.D. Power's requirements for inclusion), far surpassing most other lenders. The credit union also has excellent reviews on Trustpilot. However, membership at Navy Federal Credit Union is only available to active duty military, veterans, and their families, along with Department of Defense personnel. Furthermore, it\u2019s a clunky process to apply if you\u2019re not already a member. The credit union doesn\u2019t offer a way to pre-qualify for its personal loans, meaning you\u2019ll need to first join the credit union to see your options, even if you don\u2019t end up selecting Navy Federal as your lender. Navy Federal Credit Union is the nation\u2019s largest credit union. It was founded in 1933 and is headquartered in Vienna, Virginia. Patelco offers a wide range of loan amounts and repayment terms, doesn\u2019t charge upfront fees, allows borrowers to pre-qualify without a credit hit, and offers great digital tools. You can even earn a rate reduction by making your monthly payments on time. Wide range of loan options No origination fees Discount for consecutive on-time payments Numerous hardship repayment options Not available to poor or fair credit borrowers Doesn\u2019t allow co-signers or co-applicants Patelco\u2019s personal loan program is a bit more intricate than most lenders, but that works to your advantage. You\u2019ll be able to choose from a broad range of loan amounts and term lengths to suit just about any need you might have. Patelco also offers two discounts. The first is a 0.10% rate reduction if you meet Commitment Household Membership by using more of the credit union\u2019s services. The second discount is 0.50% off your interest rate for paying on time for 12 months straight. This discount is given up to three times for a total of 1.50% off your interest rate for the rest of the loan's life. Patelco also offers payment protection insurance and has a number of formal hardship programs, including a payment reduction program for borrowers who can document hardship, so you\u2019ll have options if you fall on hard times. If you don\u2019t live, work, or study in the areas Patelco serves, you can still join the credit union by first joining the Financial Fitness Association, which Patelco will pay for. Patelco also requires good credit or better, but the credit union will consider borrowers who don\u2019t have sufficient credit history to generate a score. Patelco Credit Union was founded in 1936 by employees of the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company. Its headquarters are in Dublin, California, and it boasts more than $9 billion in assets. Our top picks offer low rates, fast funding, excellent customer satisfaction ratings, and a relatively wide range of loan amounts and repayment terms\u2014LightStream is best for borrowers with good credit looking for a quick online application experience, Citibank is a great choice for existing Citi account holders and other who want support from a local branch, Patelco is best for civilians looking to join a credit union, and Navy Federal Credit Union is the best option for eligible military affiliates. However, you might find that another lender on our list will be a better choice for your specific needs. For example, SoFi is great for people who need a large loan and want access to some additional financial benefits, and Discover offers convenient debt consolidation loans. If you have fair credit and need a loan fast, consider pre-qualifying with Upgrade\u2014you may even be offered the option to secure your loan with collateral for a lower rate\u2014or Upstart, an AI-powered lending marketplace that also serves folks with bad credit or no credit history. If you just need a small loan, Lake Michigan Credit Union is a good choice, and you can also check your local credit union if you live outside of the region LMCU serves. An unsecured personal loan is a general-purpose installment loan. Unlike auto loans or mortgages, a personal loan can be used for just about anything. A personal loan is paid out in one lump sum after your application is approved, typically via a bank deposit or a check mailed to you. Once your personal loan funds are disbursed, you\u2019ll make the same fixed monthly payment for the life of the loan, usually a few years. Use our personal loan calculator to zero in on a loan amount and term that fits your credit, your financial history, and your budget. You can see how long it'll take you to pay down your loan\u2014and your loan's total cost\u2014with different amounts, rates, and credit levels. Most personal loans are unsecured, which means they\u2019re not backed by collateral. If you have assets such as a car or cash savings, some lenders allow you to pledge them toward a secured personal loan to get lower rates or a better chance at approval. If you default, your lender can claim ownership of your collateral to repay your debt. Personal loans may be solo, or you can have a co-signer or a co-borrower on your loan. A co-borrower is often someone such as a spouse or partner who agrees to share responsibility with you for paying off the loan from the start. Conversely, a co-signer only agrees to repay the loan if you default, giving the lender more peace of mind\u2014which can sway them into approving your application. You'll find personal loans in most places where you already do your banking. Different types of lenders may offer personal loans with contrasting features or benefits. Those with excellent credit scores might have more opportunities. Payday loans may seem like a good idea when you're in a bind, but be very careful: These loans come with high interest rates and fees, making it hard to break the cycle of debt. Instead, consider a regular personal loan or asking friends or family for help. Note that some banks offer lower rates than many credit unions do, for example, and some online lenders may be pickier about your credit score than other lenders. Among the 59 lenders we evaluated to create this list, American Express offers the lowest advertised rate, currently 6.90%. But not everyone is eligible for that rate. For one thing, American Express only lends to existing customers that it invites to apply. For another, the lowest advertised rates are only offered to borrowers with the strongest credit profiles (high credit scores, low debt-to-income ratios), and generally for loans with shorter terms. This means lenders will offer most borrowers a rate other than the lowest advertised one. And for some borrowers, that might be a rate closer to the advertised maximum. The average rate in the chart below is the average rate offered by 19 of our lender partners to borrowers who submit applications through their systems. It includes loan offers made to people with the strongest credit profiles and to those with the weakest. The rate you might be offered may be better or worse than the average (hopefully it's better), but ultimately that will depend on the strength of your credit profile. As with any financial tool, it\u2019s important to weigh the benefits against the drawbacks when borrowing money. Quick funding times Predictable monthly payments Cheaper than using credit cards Use for a wide range of expenses Builds credit with on-time payments Unsecured loans are more expensive than secured loans Harms credit if you miss payments or default May lose collateral if you default on secured loan Requires good to excellent credit for the best rates One of the reasons why personal loans are so popular is because they can be used for just about anything. People commonly use personal loans to pay for: Most lenders don\u2019t allow personal loans to be used for college tuition, gambling, house down payments, investments, or illegal activities. Many lenders also prohibit borrowers from using a personal loan for business expenses, but some lenders allow you to use the funds to start or expand a business. A personal loan may be a good option for entrepreneurs who don\u2019t qualify for traditional small business loans because they don\u2019t meet time-in-business or revenue requirements. \"If you\u2019re considering a personal loan, make sure you\u2019re clear on why you need it,\" said Ryan Greiser, CFP, a member of Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council. \"If you\u2019re consolidating high-interest debt or making a necessary big purchase, it might be worth it. But don\u2019t get sucked in by easy approvals or flashy ads\u2014personal loans come with interest rates, fees, and potential penalties.\" Debt consolidation is the most popular reason for getting a personal loan, according to Investopedia's 2023 Personal Loan Borrower Survey. Home improvements and large purchases were the next two most common reasons cited for seeking a loan. The best debt consolidation loans are personal loans with low interest rates and flexible repayment terms. As with any financial tool, it\u2019s important to weigh the benefits against the drawbacks if you\u2019re looking to borrow money. When you're shopping for a loan, here are some of the factors you should evaluate: \"These days, you don\u2019t need to visit a brick-and-mortar bank to borrow money, and you don\u2019t have to wait long for funds to be dispersed. We asked lenders about their actual underwriting processes behind the scenes, particularly if they were automated. Twenty-one said their process is fully automated, with no human involvement. Another 21 followed a fully manual underwriting process, and 17 others said they used a hybrid process that employed both automation and people. In any case, the most efficient lenders will make it easy for you to navigate their websites, get information about the loan costs and other details, and allow you to provide your financial details online. And once you are approved, they\u2019ll make it easy to get your loan proceeds, too.\" \u2014Sana Siddiqui, Investopedia Research Analyst Personal loans are usually easy to qualify for, but getting a loan with bad credit can be hard. Each lender has specific requirements you\u2019ll need to meet, but in general, your chances of qualifying with any given lender increase if you have good to excellent credit, a consistently high income, and low existing debt payments. A healthy debt-to-income ratio will improve your approval odds and help you get a better rate. It may also be easier to qualify for smaller loan amounts with shorter term lengths. Before you apply for a personal loan, take a hard look at your finances. Most lenders allow you to apply for a personal loan online, although you may be able to apply in person or over the phone, especially if you're dealing with a bank or credit union. Personal loans are not your only option if you need a flexible way to borrow money. Depending on your circumstances, here are a few other good options to consider. According to our research, LightStream is the best personal loan lender, based on its combination of competitive rates, large loan amounts, and wide range of repayment terms. If you're looking to borrow from a traditional bank, our choice is Citibank. It offers a low maximum APR and same-day funding for Citibank account holders. If you live near a Citibank branch, you can get in-person assistance with your application. If you don\u2019t have good credit or a high income on your own, it may be easier to get approved if you have a creditworthy co-signer or co-borrower. Some lenders also allow you to use collateral to better qualify for a loan or receive lower rates. Finally, a personal loan from an institution you already have a relationship with, like a bank or credit union you have a checking or savings account with, may provide a more streamlined approval process. The average personal loan borrower had a credit score of 685 during the final quarter of 2022. This can vary quite a bit, though; some lenders, such as Upstart, have no minimum credit score requirement. Others require a credit score over 700. Banks and credit unions tend to have higher credit score requirements, while fintech lenders generally accept lower credit scores. Some lenders, such as SoFi, offer personal loans up to $100,000. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll necessarily qualify for that much. Each lender assesses your financial situation\u2014including your monthly income and debt payments\u2014when deciding the maximum loan amount you can borrow after you submit a loan application. A personal loan from a bank or other lender is not considered income by the IRS and is not taxable. However, if you were to run into financial trouble and work out an agreement with your lender to forgive the loan, the amount forgiven would be considered income and would be taxable. In some cases, the lender might send you a form (1099-C, Cancellation of Debt), which will note the amount you must report on your tax return. Regardless if your lender sends you the form, you must report the forgiven debt as income on your return. The monthly cost of a personal loan, of whatever amount, will depend on the loan amount, the loan term (or the number of monthly payments), and the interest rate. The easiest way to calculate a monthly payment is to use a personal loan calculator. A $5,000 loan, paid over 24 months (or two years), with an interest rate of 12.33% (the current average rate charged on two-year personal loans, according to the Federal Reserve) would result in a monthly payment of $236.14. We researched and reviewed 59 lenders to find the 10 lenders you see above on this list. While we write individual reviews for many companies, we do not always write reviews for companies we would not recommend. Below are the lenders we researched to determine the best personal loan lenders, along with links to individual company reviews to help you learn more before making a decision: Achieve, Affinity Federal Credit Union, Alliant Credit Union, American Express, Avant, Axos, Best Egg, Bethpage Federal Credit Union, BHG Financial, Blaze Credit Union, Blue Federal Credit Union, Boeing Employees' Credit Union, Citibank, Connexus Credit Union, Discover, ENT Credit Union, Fig Loans, First Tech Federal Credit Union, Greenstate Credit Union, Happy Money, Lake Michigan Credit Union, Laurel Road, LendingClub, LendingPoint, LendingUSA, Liberty Federal Credit Union, LightStream, Mariner, Money Key, Mountain America Credit Union, NASA Federal Credit Union, Navy Federal Credit Union, Netcredit, Old National Bank, OneMain, OppLoans, Patelco Credit Union, PenFed, Personify Financial, PNC Bank, Prosper, Reach Financial, Regions, Reprise, Rocket Loans, Santander, Service Federal Credit Union, SoFi, Summit Credit Union,TD Bank, Teachers Federal Credit Union, Truist, U.S. Bank, Universal Credit, Upgrade, Upstart, USAA, Wells Fargo, Zable. Investopedia\u2019s list of the best personal loans is based on comprehensive research of 59 lenders. To evaluate and rank personal loan providers, we collected and scored over 2,600 data points from 59 lenders, including traditional banks, credit unions, fintechs, and finance companies. We researched and evaluated 45 criteria, such as APRs, loan amounts and terms, fees, customer experience, and more. Research and data collection occurred from July 23 to October 18, 2024. We organized the 45 criteria into four categories and weighted 26 (involving more than 1,500 data points), using the others for background and editorial richness. We then scored and weighted each criterion to develop our overall star rating for each lender. The categories and their weights for this project are: Learn more about how we evaluated personal loans in our complete methodology. Investopedia / Alice Morgan J.D.

            "content": "This personal loan calculator will help you determine total cost and payment amounts You can get a personal loan from online lenders, credit unions, and banks. If you're shopping for a personal loan, here's a quick look at your options for providers: Online lenders: Getting a personal loan online can often result in better interest rates. Online lenders often offer benefits like competitive rates, low/no fees, and flexible payment options. In addition, the online option can be the fastest and most convenient way to get a personal loan. Banks: Banks typically have higher interest rates and tougher lending requirements than credit unions, but you don't have to worry about the membership issues. And, if you're already a customer at the bank\u2014especially a local community bank\u2014you might get perks like lower rates or being able to qualify for a bigger loan. Credit Unions: Credit unions offer financial services to people who live, study, work, or worship in the community. To apply for a personal loan, you'll have to be a member of the credit union, and you may be required to have a minimum savings account balance. Still, credit unions often have attractive rates, and they tend to be more willing to work with borrowers who have lower credit scores and thin credit histories. To use the personal loan calculator, enter a few details about the loan: Once you enter your loan details, the personal loan calculator displays three numbers: total interest, total paid, and monthly payment. You can use them to evaluate and compare personal loans. If you choose a longer loan term, your monthly payment will be lower, and your total interest will be higher. With a shorter loan term, your monthly payment will be higher, but your total interest will be lower. Here's how the payment details change depending on the loan term you choose, assuming a $10,000 loan at 10% interest: In addition to interest, your lender may charge personal loan fees that may not be included in the personal loan calculator results. They might include: Each monthly payment you make consists of two parts: Your monthly payment stays the same for the life of the loan. However, the amounts that go toward interest and principal change. That's because, with amortized loans, the interest portion of the monthly payment depends on how much you still owe. When you first get a loan, the interest payments are larger because the balance is larger. As your balance gets smaller, the interest payments get smaller\u2014and more of your payment goes toward paying off the loan.\u00a0When you use a personal loan calculator, you will see the average and total cost of these interest payments. Here's a sample amortization schedule for a 12-month, $1,000 loan with a 15% interest rate: An easy way to multiply by a percentage is to multiply the two numbers (for example, $1,000 x 1.25) and then divide by 100. So, $1,000 x 1.25 = $1,250; then $1,250 \u00f7 100 = $12.50. When you use a personal loan calculator, the interest rates will be different for each loan. They will vary by state, lender, and other factors, including your: The average interest rate for a 24-month personal loan was 10.32% as of June 2023, according to Federal Reserve data. Meanwhile, the national average interest rate for a 36-month personal loan was 10.02% at credit unions and 10.75% at banks as of Q1 2023, according to the National Credit Union Administration. Interest rates for personal loans vary considerably depending on your credit score. In general, the higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate on your personal loan. You can calculate your monthly loan payment yourself without using an online personal loan calculator. Divide the total amount you'll pay (including the principal and interest) by the loan term (in months). For example, say the total amount you'll pay is $1,000, and the loan term is 12 months. Your monthly loan payment would be $83.33 ($1,000 \u00f7 12 = $83.33). In general, your monthly payment stays the same for the entire loan term. You can calculate the monthly interest payment by dividing the annual interest rate by the loan term in months. Then, multiply that number by the loan balance. So, for a 12-month, $1,000 loan with a 15% interest rate, your first month's interest payment would be $12.50 (1.25% x $1,000). The second month's interest would be $11.53 (1.25% x $922.24), and so on. Your payment may change if you ask your lender for a deferment. A deferment allows you to take a scheduled break from payments if you have a financial hardship. For example, you may experience a job loss, medical emergency, or national emergency. Keep in mind that the interest may continue to accrue during the deferment period. If it does, you'll have a higher total amount to pay off. You may have a higher monthly payment or a longer loan term (or both). If you\u2019re getting a deferment, clarify the terms with the lender before you agree to it. Investopedia's personal loan calculator can show you what your monthly payment, total interest paid, and total paid amounts might be, based on a specific loan. After calculating, you can: If changing the loan term length doesn't get you the loan you want, you may be able to lower your loan costs if you: Personal loans have different term lengths, but most are two-year or five-year loans. Still, you can find personal loans with longer payback periods, like 15 years. The best rates on personal loans are often found with online lenders. Credit unions typically offer the next most affordable rates, with traditional banks being the most expensive. The interest rate is highly dependent on your credit history, however. You'll likely find a fair rate from any of these sources if you have good credit. If you have bad credit, you may find it more difficult to get a loan from a bank or credit union. Some loans may incur a penalty charge if you pay off your personal loan early since that deprives them of earning the total interest. Read the fine print on your loan agreement and ask your loan officer if there are any early payment penalties before you sign your loan documents. To find the best personal loan for your financial situation, shop around and compare rates, fees, and repayment terms from several lenders. And, of course, be sure to use Investopedia's personal loan calculator to estimate monthly payment and total costs.

            "title": "When Are Personal Loans a Good Idea?",
            "content": "They can be expensive, but they're sometimes your best option Oscar Wong / Getty Images A personal loan can be used for most purposes, including debt consolidation, home improvement projects, and medical bills. Interest rates are typically far cheaper than credit card APRs, making them an attractive option, especially for borrowers who don't have collateral. However, personal loans are usually more expensive than other options, such as home equity loans, especially if you have less-than-stellar credit. Here's how to decide if a personal loan is right for you. A personal loan is typically an unsecured loan, which means that the lender does not require collateral\u2014a home or a car, for example\u2014to borrow money. However, with unsecured loans, the lender is taking a greater risk and will most likely charge a higher interest rate than a secured loan. Just how high your rate will be can depend on several factors, including your credit score and debt-to-income ratio. Some banks offer secured personal loans; the collateral can be your bank account, car, or other property. A secured personal loan may be easier to qualify for and carry a somewhat lower interest rate than an unsecured one. As with any other secured loan, you may lose your collateral if you are unable to keep up with the payments. Investopedia / Lara Antal Even with an unsecured personal loan, failing to make timely payments can harm your credit score and severely limit your ability to obtain credit in the future. FICO, the company behind the most widely used credit score, says that your payment history is the single most important factor in its formula, accounting for 35% of your credit score. Before you opt for a personal loan, you'll want to consider whether there may be less expensive options to borrow money. Some reasons for choosing a personal loan are: You might also consider a personal loan if you need to borrow for a fairly short and well-defined period of time. Personal loans typically run from 12 to 60 months. So, for example, if you have a lump sum of money due to you in two years but not enough cash flow in the meantime, a two-year personal loan could be a way to bridge that gap. Here are five more examples of when a personal loan might make sense. If you owe a substantial balance on one or more high-interest-rate credit cards, taking out a personal loan to pay them off could save you money. For example, the average interest rate on a credit card is 24.74% as of September 2024, while the average rate on a personal loan is 11.92%. That difference should allow you to pay the balance down faster and pay less interest in total. Plus, it's easier to pay off a single debt obligation rather than multiple ones. However, a personal loan is not your only option. Instead, you might be able to transfer your balances to a new credit card with a lower interest rate if you qualify. Some\u00a0balance transfer offers\u00a0even waive the interest for a promotional period of six months or more. Though a personal loan is more expensive than other loan types, it isn't necessarily the most expensive. For example, a\u00a0payday loan is likely to carry a much higher interest rate than a personal loan from a bank. Similarly, if you have an older personal loan with a higher interest rate than you would qualify for today, replacing it with a new loan could save you some money. However, before you replace a loan, be sure to find out whether there's a\u00a0prepayment penalty on the old loan or application or origination fees on the new one, which can sometimes be substantial. If you're buying new appliances, installing a new heater, or making another major purchase, taking out a personal loan could be cheaper than financing through the seller or putting the bill on a credit card. But, if you have any equity built up in your home, a\u00a0home-equity loan or home-equity line of credit\u00a0could still be less expensive. Of course, those are both secured debts, so you'll be putting your home on the line. As with any major purchase, financing an expensive event, such as a bar or bat mitzvah, a major milestone anniversary party, or a wedding, could be less expensive if you pay for it with a personal loan rather than a credit card. According to a 2021 survey by Brides and Investopedia, one in five U.S. couples will use loans or investments to help pay for their wedding. As important as these events are, you may consider scaling costs back somewhat if it means going into debt for years to pay it off. For that same reason, borrowing to fund a vacation may not be the best idea unless it's the trip of a lifetime. A personal loan can help improve your credit score if you make all your payments on time. Otherwise, it will hurt your score. Taking out a personal loan and paying it off promptly could help improve your credit score, especially if you have a history of missed payments on other debts. If your credit report shows mostly credit card debt, adding a personal loan might also help your \u201ccredit mix.\u201d Having different types of loans and showing that you can handle them responsibly is considered a plus for your score. That said, borrowing money you don't really need in the hope of improving your credit score is a dangerous proposition. Better to keep paying all your other bills on time while also trying to maintain a low credit utilization ratio (i.e., the amount of credit you are using at any given time compared with the amount that's available to you). Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, and Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. Personal loans can be used for almost any purpose, but there are a few exceptions. Most lenders will not allow you to use personal loans for the following purposes: Lenders will ask you to state the purpose of your personal loan as part of the application process. In addition, you may want to avoid using a personal loan to pay basic living expenses, as this can lead to a debt spiral. Use income to pay for regular expenses whenever possible to avoid accumulating debt. You can use a personal loan to fund almost anything, including a major purchase or event, home improvements, or to pay down higher-interest debt or an emergency expense. However, most borrowers will not allow you to use personal loans to pay for postsecondary educational expenses, a down payment on a house, or business expenses. Every lender has their own specific requirements for\u00a0applying for one of their personal loans. However, there are plenty of personal loans that are unsecured, which means you won't need any collateral. Most lenders prohibit borrowers from using personal loans for postsecondary educational expenses like tuition, room, and board. Many also stipulate that borrowers cannot use their personal loan products to pay off student loans. Personal loans can be useful in many circumstances. They aren't cheap, and there might be better alternatives. If you're considering one, Investopedia's personal loan calculator can help you determine what it would cost you and whether it fits into your monthly budget.

            "title": "How Personal Loan Interest Rates Work",
            "content": "Hero Images Inc / Getty Images Personal loans are a type of closed-end credit, with set monthly payments over a predetermined period (e.g., three, four, or five years). Interest rates on personal loans are expressed as a percentage of the principal\u2014the amount you borrow. The rate quoted is the nominal annual percentage rate (APR) or the rate applied to your loan each year, including any fees and other costs, but not costs related to compounding or the effect of inflation. Most personal loans actually use the monthly periodic rate, which is arrived at by dividing the APR by 12. When applied to the principal, the APR (or periodic rate) determines the additional amount you will pay to borrow the principal and pay it back over time. To make loans, banks must first borrow money from other banks or their customers\u2019 deposits. The interest rate on a personal loan reflects how much it costs a bank to borrow money and the inherent risk of lending money when there is no guarantee that it will be repaid. Three important factors determine the interest rate on a personal loan: A fourth factor is whether the borrower can secure the loan with collateral assets. This is discussed further below. Most personal loans are unsecured, meaning the loan is not backed by an asset the lender can take. An example of an unsecured loan could be money you borrow to go on vacation. Unsecured loans typically come with a higher interest rate to reflect the additional risk that the lender takes. Loans can also be secured\u2014that is, backed up by something of value. The thing you offer to assure the lender you will repay the loan is known as collateral. A home equity loan is an example of a secured loan because your home serves as collateral to guarantee repayment. Secured loans usually have a lower interest rate because the lender takes less risk. A personal loan calculator is useful for determining how much a high-interest unsecured loan will cost you in interest compared to a low-interest secured one. In 1968, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) implemented Regulation Z, which, in turn, created the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), designed to protect consumers when making financial transactions. Personal loans are part of that protection. Subpart C\u2014Section 1026.18 of Regulation Z requires lenders to disclose the APR, finance charge, amount financed, and the total of payments when it comes to closed-end personal loans. Other required disclosures include the number of payments, monthly payment amount, late fees, and whether there is a penalty for paying the loan off early. In 2024, the average personal loan interest rate fluctuated. By September, it was 25.94%. The rate you pay will depend on the lender and your credit score. Secured personal loans may come with lower rates than unsecured loans. It's smart to shop around for the best personal loans before deciding which is right for your situation. Armed with Regulation Z disclosure requirements and knowledge of how interest on closed-end personal loans is calculated, it\u2019s possible to make an informed choice when borrowing money. Lenders use one of three methods\u2014simple, compound, or add-on\u2014to calculate interest on personal loans. Each method relies on the stated APR provided in the disclosure document. The most common method used for personal loans is the simple interest method, also known as the U.S. Rule method. The primary feature of simple interest is that the interest rate is always applied to the principal only. Using the example of a $10,000 loan at 10% APR over five years (60 months), simply plug the appropriate numbers into Investopedia\u2019s loan calculator. In this case, the beginning principal balance is $10,000, the interest rate is 10%, and the original term is 60 months. The calculator returns the monthly payment plus the total principal and interest over the life of the loan. You can also get a complete five-year amortization schedule telling you exactly how much principal and interest you will pay each month. As the calculator shows, with simple interest and on-time payments, the amount of interest you pay goes down over time, and your payment applied to the principal goes up until the loan is paid off. If you make your payments early or make extra payments, you will pay less interest overall and may even pay off your loan early. If you pay late or skip payments, your payment amount applied to interest increases, resulting in less of each payment applied to the principal. Interest (and late fees) are kept separate (escrow). Accumulated principal, interest, or late fees will be due at the end of your loan. Test these assertions by adding to the payment amount, reducing, or deleting payments to see the impact each has on the total you pay. A late or missed payment can hurt your credit score, making it harder to borrow money in the future. With the compound interest method, also known as the normal or actuarial method, if you make all your payments on time, the results are the same as with the simple interest method because interest never accumulates. The same circumstances apply to paying early or making extra payments. Both can result in a shorter loan term and less interest paid overall. The accumulated interest is added to the principal if you are late or miss payments with a compound interest loan. Future interest calculations result in \u201cinterest on interest.\u201d In this scenario, you will have even more leftover interest and principal at the end of your loan term. You can test these scenarios with the same online calculator by plugging in the same numbers but selecting \u201cNormal\u201d as the amortization method. Common examples of the use of compound interest are credit cards, student loans, and mortgages. The add-on interest method doesn\u2019t require a calculator. That\u2019s because the interest is calculated upfront, added to the principal, and the total is divided by the number of payments (months). To arrive at the amount of interest you will pay using the $10,000 loan example above, multiply the beginning balance by the APR times the number of years to pay off the loan\u2014i.e., $10,000 \u00d7 0.10 \u00d7 5 = $5,000. Principal and interest add up to $15,000. Divide the $15,000 by 60 (the length of the loan) and your monthly payments will be $250, consisting of $166.67 principal and $83.33 interest. Whether you pay on time, early, or late, the total paid will be $15,000 (not including potential late fees). Payday loans, short-term advance loans, and money loaned to subprime borrowers are examples of loans with add-on interest. You can get a much lower interest rate if you have assets to use as collateral for your loan. The table below shows the differences among simple, compound, and add-on interest when applied to a $10,000 personal loan at 10% APR over five years with and without missed payments. The amounts shown do not include late-payment fees or other charges, which vary by lender. Comparing the three methods clearly shows why you should avoid add-on interest at all costs. It also shows that compound interest adds up when payments are late or missed. In conclusion, simple interest is the most favorable to the borrower. * With a total of three missed payments, one each at the end of years one, two, and three1 Total principal and interest when paid on time2 Total principal and interest with three missed payments In September 2024, the lender with the lowest average personal loan interest rate was LightStream with 12.72% APR. However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll qualify, as they will likely have certain requirements like a minimum credit score. There may be other lenders offering even lower rates. A good interest rate is typically one that\u2019s lower than the national average. You may get a better deal if you have a strong income and credit history or can offer collateral to secure your loan. Unfortunately, the easiest personal loans are also often those with the worst interest rates. Payday lenders may charge as much as 780% APR, and credit card rates can run to 20% or even higher. These loans have high-interest rates partially because almost anyone, including borrowers with bad credit, can qualify for them. Personal loan interest rates vary. By using our guidelines, you can better determine which lender is offering the best loan and what interest rate is right for your needs.

Maskot / Getty Images There\u2019s a lot to know when seeking a personal loan. For example, how is a personal loan different from more familiar types, like auto loans and mortgage loans? What can you use personal loans for? Are there any alternatives to personal loans? To get the answers to these and other questions, Investopedia spoke with Linda M. Hooks, head of the Department of Economics at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. In addition to leading the largest department at Washington and Lee, Dr. Hooks has conducted and published research in a variety of economic areas. Our edited conversation follows. Investopedia: \"For starters, what\u2019s a personal loan, and how does it differ from other types of loans?\" Hooks: \"A personal loan is a fixed-payment loan for an individual consumer. An individual borrows money now and repays it over a specific time period by paying the same amount monthly. In that way, it is similar to a car loan or a mortgage payment. It is different from those types of loans because it may not require collateral or an item of value, such as a car or home, that you agree to forfeit if you cannot repay.\" Investopedia: \"What can personal loan funds be used for?\" Hooks: \"Personal loans are versatile. They can be used for purchases that are too large to buy with cash, such as a new appliance or air conditioner. They sometimes can be used for consolidating other debt. They can be used for one-time expenses such as medical bills, educational expenses, or perhaps a special trip.\" Investopedia: \"What qualifications do you need to have to apply for a personal loan?\" Hooks: \"As with most loans, the primary qualification is a good credit history. Sometimes, it may be possible to use collateral for a personal loan, and this may help to make you qualified for a personal loan or a better rate on the loan. Ask your bank what else might be accepted as collateral, such as savings accounts or an insurance policy.\" Investopedia: \"Where can people find out their credit score, and does it cost money?\" Hooks: \"Generally, you can obtain a credit score only by paying a fee. However, you can obtain a free credit report from the website AnnualCreditReport.com. You can find additional information on this service, including a phone number and mailing address if you prefer to order a report that way, at the Federal Trade Commission website titled Free Credit Reports. The information in your credit report is the basis for the credit score, so you may not need to see the actual credit score as long as your credit report looks accurate.\" Investopedia: \"How do lenders determine how much people can borrow?\" Hooks: \"To determine how much a person could borrow, lenders use the credit score along with other factors such as possible collateral or an already-existing financial relationship with you.\" Investopedia: \"What are some ways to improve your chances if you are not approved?\" Hooks: \"If your application is denied, you have a right under federal law to know why it was denied. This can help you decide what to do next. Often, the denial is due to a low credit score, and you can work to improve the score. Some steps to improve your credit score include paying bills on time and paying the amount required, which is at least the minimum payment required on a credit card. You should pay more than that, if possible. Do not charge the maximum allowed by your credit cards, meaning keep the balance well below the maximum.\" Investopedia: \"Can you pay a personal loan off early, or does that depend on the terms of the loan?\" Hooks: \"Early repayment of the loan might be possible, but it does depend on your specific loan. Ask before you sign the loan documents if there would be any penalty associated with early repayment.\" Investopedia: \"What is a co-signer, and when might a borrower need one?\" Hooks: \"A co-signer is someone additional who agrees to repay the loan if you cannot. Having a co-signer can help someone with a limited credit history to obtain a loan. However, the co-signer should be aware that they are liable for the loan in the same way that they would be if it were their own loan. It may also affect the co-signer\u2019s credit history and score.\" Investopedia: \"What are some alternatives to a personal loan?\" Hooks: \"Alternatives to a personal loan might include a home equity loan or a credit card. Another alternative, if it is a planned expense, is to save up for the purchase and buy it only after you have saved the funds for the item.\" Investopedia: \"Where do you go to complain if you feel your lender is doing something illegal or wrong?\" Hooks: \"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was established under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 to provide consumers with resources and an avenue for complaints about financial services.\" Investopedia: \"What happens if you have financial problems and can\u2019t make loan payments?\" Hooks: \"If you run into financial problems and feel you would have trouble making a payment, contact your lender as soon as possible. There may be federal government programs that can help you as well, and you could find information on that on the CFPB website.\" Consider carefully the option of obtaining a personal loan. For example, in some circumstances, it may make sense to forgo a personal loan so that you can instead qualify for a home mortgage.\" - Linda Hooks, Head of the Department of Economics at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), there are four ways to get your credit score: It depends on the terms of your personal loan. It\u2019s always wise to ask about penalties, including early-payoff penalties, before applying for a loan. A private student loan comes with lower interest rates, offers more flexibility in repayment, and typically allows you to write off interest payments on your taxes. If you need money to pay for college and college expenses, a private student loan is probably best. If you have other non-school-related expenses, a personal loan may be best. Personal loans offer flexibility for purchases that might not fit into a purpose-built loan, such as an auto loan or mortgage. Personal loans can be obtained relatively quickly, and with a good credit history, they can have lower rates than a credit card. However, personal loans can be fairly expensive if you have bad credit. Carefully consider your long-term financial goals before taking out a personal loan. In the long run, saving up for your big expenses may be a wiser move. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"My Credit Application Was Denied Because Of My Credit Report.

It's also the best option for flexible repayment terms (up to 84 months) and secured loans (the lender may offer borrowers the option of using a vehicle as collateral). Upgrade offers a wide range of loan amounts. You also have the option to apply with a co-borrower if your credit isn't sufficient to qualify by yourself. And you can receive your loan funds within one day of your loan being approved, making Upgrade a good choice when you're up against a financial emergency.

Many lenders we evaluated don't charge origination or late payment fees. In contrast, Upgrade charges a late fee if your loan payment is not paid within 15 days of the due date, and the lender deducts an origination fee of up to 9.99% from your initial loan proceeds. Upgrade is a fintech company that was founded in 2017 and is headquartered in San Francisco,. Upstart\u2019s minimum credit score requirement is only 300, and the lender may also accept college students and graduates with no credit history, making it our top pick for poor credit borrowers. Upstart also disburses loan funds within one business day of origination, so the lender is a good option in an emergency. You may qualify with poor credit or no credit Low starting APRs Funding the next business day No minimum income requirement Origination fee as high as 12% Charges late fees Only two repayment term options If your income has held you back from getting a personal loan, Upstart might be right for you. There\u2019s no minimum credit score required to qualify. You either must have a credit score or have graduated from or are currently enrolled in a higher education program. This makes Upstart the best choice for borrowers with poor credit. The Upstart platform uses an AI underwriting process that may assist bad credit borrowers in getting a competitive rate, and you can get a rate estimate without hurting your credit. Another benefit of getting a loan through Upstart is the lender\u2019s competitive interest rates. The maximum interest rate is on the higher end\u2014though it's on par for bad credit loans\u2014but its minimum credit score is lower than any other lender we considered. Upstart only offers a three- or five-year repayment term, so borrowers who need more time for repayment should look elsewhere. Bad credit borrowers may also pay an origination fee of up to 12% of the loan amount and Upstart charges a late fee of 5% of the payment or $15, whichever is greater, if your payment is not received by 10 days after the due date. Upstart is a lending marketplace that was founded in 2012 and is headquartered in San Mateo, California. Upstart has connected more than 3 million customers with over 100 banks, and the platform\u2019s unique AI underwriting model allows lenders to approve more borrowers at lower APRs. LendingClub stands out for fast funding because the typical LendingClub applicant is approved in just two hours, after which the lender sends the funds directly to the borrower\u2019s bank account. Keep in mind that the process could take longer depending on your individual situation, but you should receive the funds within a few days. Quick lending decision Offers direct payment for debt consolidation Allows co-applicants Allows borrowers to refinance and get more cash Charges an origination fee up to 8% Charges late fees LendingClub has a minimum credit score of 660, but you can apply with a co-borrower if you don\u2019t meet the requirement. LendingClub approves applications in an average of two hours, and you can receive your money as soon as the next business day. LendingClub can also pay your creditors directly if you\u2019re using the loan for debt consolidation, and you may earn a rate discount if you use the funds to pay off existing debt. LendingClub also offers medical loans, which are paid directly to your healthcare provider and come with lower rates and higher borrowing limits. In addition, LendingClub offers the TopUp loan program, which allows you to refinance your LendingClub personal loan to take out additional cash and potentially get a lower interest rate. While LendingClub\u2019s rating in the J.D. Power U.S. 2024 Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study is just about average for the industry, it\u2019s ranked higher than other bad credit lenders, and LendingClub also has an excellent Trustpilot rating. LendingClub is an online bank that launched in 2007 and provides a full suite of banking and investment services in addition to personal loans. It is headquartered in San Francisco. Universal Credit accepts applications from borrowers with a credit score of 580 or better, and the lender may offer a secured loan to borrowers who don\u2019t qualify for an unsecured personal loan. The lender also distributes loan funds within one day of approval. May offer auto-secured loans Offers a wide range of loan amounts No minimum income requirement Low minimum credit score High APRs Minimum 5.25% origination fee Limited repayment term options Like its parent Upgrade, Universal Credit offers personal loans backed by vehicles. Putting up collateral like a car can help you qualify for a loan that might otherwise be out of reach, or it can help you get a better rate on a loan you do qualify for. The risk is that if you can\u2019t pay back the loan, you could lose your car. Another positive is that Universal Credit offers pre-qualification, so you can check on your eligibility without dinging your credit score. The lender has no minimum income requirement. If you\u2019re using the loan for debt consolidation, you can opt for direct payment to your creditors. Universal Credit has excellent customer reviews on Trustpilot. However, Universal Credit is among the more expensive lenders in our database. It charges origination fees, and its advertised APR range tilts toward the higher end. Be sure to take advantage of pre-qualification to compare Universal Credit\u2019s rates and terms with at least a couple more lenders. Universal Credit is an online lending platform based in San Francisco that has been offering personal loans since 2020. Patelco is a credit union that offers low APRs capped at 17.9%, flexible repayment terms, and funding as soon as the next business day. While the minimum credit score for a personal loan is 640, you can apply with a co-applicant to improve your chances of approval. Flexible loan amounts and repayment terms Low APRs No origination fee Next-day funding possible Must become a member to apply for a loan Branches only in California 640 minimum credit score Patelco is our pick for the best credit union for bad credit emergency loans, and also has more loan flexibility than many other lenders. First, Patelco offers loans ranging from $300 to $100,000. This is a huge advantage because most lenders don\u2019t offer loans of less than $1,000 or more than $50,000. Patelco also offers flexible loan terms and competitive interest rates. Loan terms start at just six months, which grants you access to the best interest rates. You can also spread your loan out over up to seven years for loans of $30,000 or more, which helps reduce your monthly payment. Patelco also offers a couple of discount opportunities, including a rate reduction for consistent on-time payments. Finally, Patelco offers a variety of personal loan types that might appeal to borrowers with poor credit. In addition to an unsecured personal loan, you can choose from a secured credit builder loan, a secured savings loan, and other secured lending options. Originally founded in 1936, Patelco has 37 branches across Northern California. While credit unions only offer personal loans to members, Patelco makes it easy for anyone to join, even people who don\u2019t live or work in the region. Prosper, a peer-to-peer lending marketplace, allows people with a minimum FICO score of 600 to apply individually, and you can also apply with a co-borrower to increase your approval odds. You can get the cash you need in as little as one business day. Allows joint applications Next-day funding possible No minimum income requirement Easy to change monthly due date Origination fee up to 9.99% Poor J.D. Power rating You can get a loan from the Prosper marketplace with a FICO score as low as 600. If you have poor credit or want to get a lower rate, you can also apply with a co-borrower who will be jointly responsible for the loan, and Prosper will consider their financial info when making an approval decision. The lender offers loans up to $50,000 with competitive starting rates and several repayment term options. You can also get your cash as soon as the next business day, which is helpful in an emergency. However, Prosper charges an origination fee between 1% and 9.99% of the loan amount, which will be deducted from the money you receive. You may also pay late fees or other fees in certain circumstances. The lending marketplace has a below-average rating in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Consumer Lending Study, but customers have mostly positive things to say about Prosper on Trustpilot, where the company has an excellent rating. Prosper was founded in 2005 and is headquartered in San Francisco. Prosper is the first peer-to-peer lending marketplace and has issued more than 1 million loans to borrowers. Upgrade is our choice for the best option for most people who have fair credit or who are applying with a co-applicant and need funds fast. The wide range of loan amounts and repayment terms means that most people can get what they need from the lender. Patelco Credit Union and Prosper offer similar options for folks applying with a co-borrower, but membership is required for the former, and the latter offers fewer repayment term options. People with poor credit or no credit history may have better luck getting individually approved with Upstart. And those seeking to put forth collateral may find that Universal Credit is the best fit for their needs. LendingClub is great for people who need fast cash or are looking to pay for medical expenses, but borrowers with poor credit will need to apply with a co-applicant. An emergency loan is a personal loan that provides a borrower with a lump sum of money that can be used for almost any purpose\u2014including emergencies like unexpected medical bills and urgent home repairs. Not every emergency is dire, so be careful about spending your emergency fund. Regular car maintenance is not an emergency (ideally, you'll budget for this); a repair to keep your car safely on the road and operable is worth a dip into your emergency fund. Personal loans aren't your only option in an emergency. If you have bad credit, you may need to consider other types of emergency loans, such as payday loans, pawn loans, or car title loans (learn more about these below). Each of these options will cost significantly more than a traditional personal loan, yet these may be your only options if your credit is poor. If you've got bad credit, this may be the worst time to get a personal loan, since your poor credit will limit your choices and cost you more money in fees and interest. That said, if you're in a tight spot, you may not have time to wait, and an emergency loan may be your best option. It can be cheaper than alternatives like a payday loan or credit card cash advance. And since an emergency loan is unsecured, it doesn't require you to put up collateral as you would with a car title loan or a pawn loan.\u00a0Plus, in addition to helping you out of a jam, your loan, properly managed, can help improve your credit score in two ways: A personal loan may not be an option for borrowers with very low credit scores. In our research, only a few lenders had minimum credit scores below 600, which is considered \u201cFair.\u201d Other options may be a cash advance from a credit card, a payday loan, a car title loan, a loan from a lender that uses non-traditional scoring, or a short-term loan from a cash advance app. All of these options feature higher rates and fees than personal loans. You should carefully consider the costs before taking on additional debt. \u2014Sana Siddiqui, Research Analyst, Investopedia Some lenders may have restrictions on how you can use the loan, such as for investing or gambling or to pay for college tuition and fees, but most situations that we would consider \"emergencies\" aren't among them. Because loans to borrowers with bad credit are expensive, you should carefully consider whether or not your situation is a true emergency. Situations that might qualify include: \"Personal loans are not created equal,\" said Lawrence Sprung, CFP, a member of Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council, \"and you should evaluate the terms and conditions for the loan, in addition to the interest rate. Be sure that the loan fits your needs and that you have no other options that may offer an easier path to obtaining the loan and paying it back.\" In Investopedia's Personal Loan Borrowers Survey, when we asked current and potential borrowers what they planned to use their loan for, more borrowers said debt consolidation than for any other reason. The next most common uses were loans for home improvements, large purchases, and medical expenses. You won't find \"bad\" credit as an official credit score rating, at least not in your FICO credit score. Instead, your bad credit may be listed as \"fair\" or \"poor\" (or just \"no credit\" if your credit history is thin). There's no secret to improving your credit score\u2014and there are no shortcuts either. The credit bureaus are transparent about what goes into a credit score. Once you understand those factors, you can create a plan and begin to repair your credit. \"A few years ago, I had a few missteps with my credit due to bad medical debt and some late bills. My FICO score dropped to the mid-500s. It was really bad. But paying down my credit card balances and paying all my bills within 30 days really helped. I was able to get my FICO 8 score up to 700 in just a year. It helps to pay everything off, but getting your credit utilization under 50% and then 30% and eventually 10% will drive your score up quickly\u2014even with a lot of late payments on your record.\" \u2014TJ Donegan, Senior Director, Investopedia Growth & Strategy When choosing an emergency loan for bad credit, some factors to consider include how much the loan will cost, the repayment terms you can get (which will determine your monthly payment), and how quickly you can apply and get funded. Before applying for an emergency loan for bad credit, gather your personally identifiable information (e.g., Social Security number [SSN], date of birth, address), income information, and details about the funding you need (i.e., loan amount and purpose). This will make the application process easier, as lenders will require you to provide this information. \"In early 2015, I used a personal loan from PNC Bank to cover some unexpected, semi-urgent, and pricey medical costs, and it was well worth it. Not only did it help me pay for what I needed to in less than 30 days (the bank was able to approve and disburse funds quickly following an online application), but it helped me avoid putting a five-figure charge on a credit card with a 20%-plus interest rate (the only other alternative I had at the time given my age, short credit history, and lower emergency savings account balance). The loan also helped diversify my credit profile, as I only had student loans and a couple credit cards back then. I watched my score rise as I started paying it off with on-time payments, too, which was an added bonus for someone still fairly early in their credit journey.\" \u2014Sienna Wrenn, Senior Editor, Investopedia Special Projects An unsecured personal loan isn't your only option for an urgent loan, but you should carefully evaluate all of the following alternatives before choosing one. If none of the above sources of financial help are available to you, consider local assistance programs. The United Way, FindHelp, 211, and your local state government's website (such as California's Find Assistance page) can point you toward organizations and programs that may be able to help. If emergencies are unavoidable, borrowing to pay for one doesn't have to be. All you need is a dedicated savings account\u2014an emergency fund\u2014to help see you through. But how do you build one? Let's compare what it costs to build a $3,500 emergency fund versus the cost to repay a $3,500 emergency loan. We'll open a high-yield savings account for the emergency fund that earns 5.00%. We'll assume an interest rate of 30% for the emergency loan, representing \"bad\" credit interest rate offers you might receive. Also, let's assume a four-year repayment term and use a loan calculator to find a monthly payment: $113.24. That results in $2,549 in interest expense for a total repayment of $6,049. Meanwhile, if instead of finding room in your budget to repay a loan, you find room to invest in a savings account, and you direct $113.24 to your emergency fund savings account, earning 5% interest. After two years and five months, your account will have grown to $3,625, with $229 of that interest you earned on $3,284 in deposits. (You can calculate your own savings goals here.) While opening a savings account and building an emergency fund can't cover your emergency expenses today, it will help you out of a jam in two and a half years and cost you thousands of dollars less in loan fees. An emergency personal loan for bad credit will usually come with the typical fees of any personal loan\u2014mainly origination fees, interest fees, and late payment fees. But those fees may be higher than a loan offered to a person with good credit. Multiple types of lenders offer emergency loans for bad credit, including: Remember, just because a borrowing option is available doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good choice. Credit card cash advances, for example, are notoriously expensive and might damage your credit score by driving up your credit utilization ratio. It\u2019s also a good idea to avoid payday loans and title loans whenever possible. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) warns that the average two-week payday loan features a steep APR that\u2019s equivalent to nearly 400%. Some types of emergency loans can affect your credit score, while others will not. If a lender doesn\u2019t report your account to one of the three major credit bureaus, the loan won\u2019t influence your credit score\u2014unless you default and a collection agency adds the bad debt to your credit reports at a later date. However, if a lender does share your account details with the credit bureaus, that\u2019s a different story. A traditional bank, credit union, and online lender generally will report account details to the credit bureaus. Payday lenders and title lenders generally do not. When a lender reports an emergency loan to the credit bureaus, the way you manage the account dictates whether it will help or hurt your credit score. If you make your payments on time, the account may benefit your credit score in the long run. However, if you make late payments or become past due on your debt, that emergency loan could hurt your credit score instead. Many lenders offer fast funding to qualified borrowers. Some personal loan lenders may even deposit the funds into your bank account the same day you\u2019re approved for financing. On the other hand, loan funding can sometimes take several days or even up to a few weeks. Certain lenders may take longer to process your loan application or release your funds than others. There\u2019s also a chance that your personal bank or credit union may hold the funds a lender deposits into your account for a few days before you can access the money. Although some lenders do provide loans without credit checks, they're not recommended. Such lenders (like payday loan lenders) often charge steep origination or application fees and high APRs. Not only are these types of loans very expensive, but you might end up getting stuck in a payday borrowing cycle that\u2019s difficult to escape. Among the lenders on our list, Upstart says it will offer loans to borrowers with credit scores of just 300, so long there are no other adverse entries in their credit reports. Other lenders we researched report minimum credit scores of 580 or 560, which are considered \"fair\" and \"poor,\" respectively. If your first priority is fast cash, you have several options, although some of them will be expensive, with high interest rates and fees. We researched and reviewed 59 lenders to find the lenders you see above on this list. While we write individual reviews for many companies, we do not always write reviews for companies we would not recommend.

Investopedia researchers collected and analyzed dozens of key data points from 59 lenders to identify the most important factors for readers choosing the right lender to suit their needs. We used this data to review each company for interest rates, fees, repayment terms, and other features to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decision for their needs. Investopedia launched in 1999, and has been helping readers find the best emergency loans for bad credit since 2020. Investopedia\u2019s list of the best personal loans is based on comprehensive research of 59 lenders. To evaluate and rank personal loan providers, we collected and scored over 2,600 data points from 59 lenders, including traditional banks, credit unions, fintechs, and finance companies. We researched and evaluated 45 criteria such as APRs, loan amounts and terms, fees, customer experience, and more. Research and data collection occurred from July 23 to Oct. 18, 2024. We organized the 45 criteria into four categories and weighted 26 (involving more than 1500 data points), using the others for background and editorial richness. We then scored and weighted each criterion to develop our overall star rating for each lender. The categories and their weights for this project are: Learn more about how we evaluated personal loans in our complete methodology.

Getting a personal loan with bad credit can be difficult, but several online lenders and credit unions offer options for fair or poor credit borrowers. Personal loans have more favorable rates and terms than many other loans for bad credit. Of the lenders we evaluated, Upgrade was our top pick due to its low starting rates and quick funding. The lender also allows joint applications and may offer secured loans to borrowers who might not otherwise make the cut. We collected hundreds of data points for 59 lenders and selected seven winners based on cost, customer experience, repayment terms, eligibility requirements, and funding time.

The right lender for you will depend on your financial situation and borrowing needs, but this list of reputable lenders is a great place to start. Upgrade has a low minimum credit score requirement, offers auto-secured loans to help borrowers qualify, and allows joint applications if you need help getting approved. The lender typically disburses funds within one business day after you accept your loan offer, and borrowers have great things to say about Upgrade on Trustpilot. Offers secured loans and joint applications Quick funding as soon as the next day Flexible repayment terms up to 7 years Excellent Trustpilot rating Below-average J.D. Power rating All loans have an origination fee Overall, Upgrade has a strong reputation for being a fair lender with a lower minimum credit score, a high borrowing limit, and longer loan terms than some other lenders. Upgrade\u2019s appeal starts with the ability to get a rate quote without any hard credit inquiries and funding within one day of approval. Additionally, Upgrade may lower your loan rate if you set up autopay, use all or part of the loan to pay off existing debt, or use your car as collateral for a secured loan. Upgrade\u2019s Credit Health tool lets you monitor your credit, get tips on improving your credit score, and receive fraud alerts. This feature is especially helpful if you have poor credit scores as you work to better your credit and regain control of your finances. The lender also offers a short-term hardship program, which may be helpful if your financial situation changes and you\u2019re struggling with repayment. Upgrade\u2019s starting rates are reasonable, but the top end of the interest rate range gets high, and Upgrade charges an origination fee that is deducted from the loan proceeds for all loans. Originally founded in 2017, Upgrade is headquartered in San Francisco and has offices in Phoenix; Atlanta; Orange County, California; and Montreal. Upstart\u2019s AI underwriting model results in lower rates than traditional models and may also work in your favor if you have poor credit. Applicants with a credit score as low as 300 are eligible to apply, and college students and graduates with no credit history also qualify. Low minimum credit score Funds sent within one business day Good loan amount flexibility Industry-leading Trustpilot rating Low starting APRs Up to 12% origination fee Only two loan term options Individual applicants only If you have a credit score that\u2019s in the \u201cpoor\u201d range\u2014between 300 and 579\u2014finding a loan can be hard. Finding a loan with an annual percentage rate (APR) that\u2019s not in the high double or triple digits can be even harder. That\u2019s where Upstart comes in. It has one of the lowest minimum credit scores of any lender on our list; its minimum required score is 300, which is the lowest possible score you can have. You can borrow up to $50,000, and if approved, your loan funds can be disbursed in as little as one day. Even if you have no credit history at all, you can still be eligible for a loan if you are enrolled in or graduated from a degree program. Though borrowers with the best credit scores have access to low rates and no origination fee, Upstart charges a higher maximum APR and origination fee than many other lenders. And the lender doesn\u2019t offer the option to apply with a co-signer to get a better rate. Originally founded in 2012, Upstart is headquartered in San Mateo, California, and has offices in Columbus, Ohio, and Austin, Texas. When you apply for a debt consolidation loan from Achieve, you can choose to have the lender pay your creditors on your behalf and even earn a discount for choosing this option. You can individually qualify for a personal loan from Achieve with a credit score as low as 620, and you can also apply with a co-borrower if you have bad credit. Several loan discounts are available Allows joint applications Apply with help from a dedicated loan consultant High minimum borrowing amount Charges an origination fee If you\u2019re looking to consolidate debt with a personal loan, you may want to go with a lender that pays your creditors directly, an option that Achieve offers. In fact, if you take advantage of that option, you\u2019ll get a discount on your loan interest. You can pre-qualify for a loan with Achieve without damaging your credit, and if you need help with your application, you can talk to a dedicated loan consultant. The lender has an excellent Trustpilot rating. Achieve doesn\u2019t offer loans in all states, and the lender requires a 620 minimum credit score, which is in the fair credit range. But you can apply with a co-borrower to improve your chances of approval and get a rate discount. You can also get a lower rate by showing proof of retirement savings. Funding timelines vary, but a same-day approval and disbursement within 24 hours is possible. Originally founded in 2002, Achieve is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona. Universal Credit sends the funds to your bank account within one business day after you accept a loan offer, making the lender a great option for emergency loans. You can qualify for a loan with a credit score as low as 580, and if you don\u2019t qualify, Universal Credit may offer you the chance to secure your loan with your car title. Wide range of loan amounts Excellent Trustpilot rating Fast funding Offers direct payment to creditors High minimum APR High origination fee of at least 5.25% Universal Credit offers loan amounts between $1,000 and $50,000 to meet almost any funding need, including debt consolidation. The lender offers direct payment to your creditors for convenience. Universal Credit requires a low minimum credit score of 580, and you can check your eligibility and rate without hurting your credit. During pre-qualification, the lender may offer you the chance to use your vehicle as collateral if you don\u2019t qualify for an unsecured loan. Once you\u2019re approved and sign your loan documents, the lender will disburse the funds to your bank account within one business day. Universal Credit has relatively high APRs and charges an origination fee between 5.25% and 9.99% which is deducted from the initial funds you receive, but higher costs are common among bad credit lenders. Most borrowers speak highly of the lender on Trustpilot, and you\u2019ll have access to extended customer service hours if you need help with your loan. Universal Credit is an online lending platform that is powered by Upgrade, a financial technology company founded in 2017. Universal Credit began offering personal loans issued by Cross River Bank in 2020. The company is based in San Francisco. Patelco Credit Union requires a minimum credit score of 640. Though membership is required, joining is easy and gets you access to low rates and a wide range of loan amounts and repayment terms. Offers loan amount and repayment term flexibility No origination fees Offers unique discount opportunities Requires membership Branches only in California 640 minimum credit score Patelco Credit Union offers a number of personal loan products to anyone who becomes a member. Membership eligibility is open to all with Financial Fitness Association membership, even though branches are concentrated in California. Patelco provides access to funding for those who might not have the best credit. We like that the APR range is competitive and you have a wider loan amount range than most lenders offer. Another factor that sets Patelco apart is its LevelUp program, which rewards consistent, on-time payments. Each year that you pay on time (if you qualify for the program), your rate will go down by 0.50%, up to a 1.5% maximum. You can also get a 0.10% discount if you use other Patelco services, like a checking account, and meet additional criteria. If you\u2019re struggling to repay a personal loan from Patelco, you can opt to skip a regular monthly payment for a $25 fee or take advantage of Patelco\u2019s repayment assistance options designed to help borrowers facing financial hardship. Originally founded in 1936, Patelco is headquartered in Dublin, California, and has 36 additional offices across Northern California. It\u2019s possible to qualify for a personal loan from Avant with a credit score as low as 550. Making your personal loan payments on time may improve your credit score, which could qualify you to refinance your loan with Avant. Refinancing can get you a lower APR and additional money if you need it. Low minimum credit score Allows eligible borrowers to refinance Funding as soon as the next business day Excellent Trustpilot rating Fee of up to 9.99% deducted from proceeds Doesn\u2019t allow co-signers or co-applicants Below-average J.D. Power rating Though the typical borrower at Avant has a credit score between 600 and 700, you can qualify for a personal loan with a credit score as low as 550. You may pay an APR as high as 35.99% with an administration fee of up to 9.99% if you have bad credit. However, Avant reports your payment activity to the three major credit bureaus, giving you the opportunity to improve your score with on-time payments. After a credit score increase, you may be eligible to refinance your loan with Avant at a lower rate. You can get a rate estimate from Avant with only a soft credit check, which won\u2019t hurt your credit. You can typically choose a repayment term between 24 and 60 months, and if you\u2019re approved for a loan, you can get the cash within one business day. While Avant received a relatively poor score in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study, customers have mostly positive things to say about the lender on Trustpilot. Avant is an online lending platform that was founded in 2012 and has helped more than two million people get access to funding. The company is headquartered in Chicago. WebBank originates all loans serviced by Avant and its partners. Upgrade is our top choice for best personal loans for bad credit for its secured and joint application options, fast funding, and flexible repayment terms. Universal Credit is another great option for borrowers with fair credit who need fast funding. But borrowers with bad credit looking to apply on their own may have a better chance with Upstart, which offers options to people with any credit score or no credit history. If you want to apply with a co-borrower, you\u2019ll get low rates, many repayment term options, and some unique benefits by joining Patelco Credit Union, while Achieve may be a better choice for applying with a co-applicant to consolidate debt. If your goal is to improve your credit and you want the chance to snag a lower rate partway through the term, you may want to choose Avant for its refinancing options. Bad credit loans are loans for individuals with low credit scores, usually 579 or less. Although there are many types, the most common are unsecured personal loans. There\u2019s no collateral, you\u2019ll have a fixed interest rate and fixed monthly payments, and, like other loans, these will show up on your credit reports and affect your credit score. Unsecured personal loans for bad credit are just like any other unsecured personal loan, and they can be an invaluable lifeline when facing unexpected expenses. However, they typically come with more fees and higher APRs than traditional loans extended to people with better credit. If you have bad credit and are in need of financial assistance following a natural disaster, such as the recent hurricanes, you may still be able to secure an emergency loan. Applying and qualifying for an emergency loan for bad credit is similar to getting any other type of personal loan, though they tend to have lower maximum loan amounts. Having bad credit does mean you'll likely be stuck with a high interest rate, but the APRs on this type of loan are typically still more reasonable compared to other short-term lending options, such as payday loans. However, it's generally better to avoid taking on debt while you're already in dire straits if you can. If you don't have time to look into less costly options and need cash as soon as possible, then an emergency loan may still be your best bet. As an alternative (or in addition) to getting an emergency loan, the federal government offers several forms of financial assistance that can help you cover bills, pay for food, finance a home repair, and more. While there are a number of different credit-scoring models, one of the most commonly used is the FICO credit scoring system. Having \"bad credit\" typically means being in the \"fair\" or \"poor\" categories. Your FICO score considers both positive and negative information listed in your credit report (also known as your credit profile), which is grouped into the following five weighted categories. The Payment History category shows whether or not you've paid your past credit accounts on time. Payment History has more weight than any individual factor on your FICO score due to its importance to creditors, as this information allows lenders to better assess how much of a credit risk a prospective borrower represents. Credit reports typically list late payments using 30-day intervals (e.g., 30 days late, 60 days late, etc.). Unsurprisingly, the higher the number of days late, the greater the impact this has on your credit score. After 150 days, late payments may be reported as \"charge off\" (i.e., written off as a loss due to severe delinquency). As the name suggests, the Amounts Owed category shows how much debt you carry in total. Fortunately, having extant debt doesn't inherently indicate that you're a high-risk borrower to potential lenders. That said, if the information included in your Amounts Owed category shows that you're using a lot of your available credit, that could negatively impact your FICO score. If you have a long credit history, that will always be good for your FICO score. According to myFICO, the Length of Credit History category considers the following pieces of information: The Credit Mix category represents the different kinds of accounts that make up your credit report, such as credit cards, mortgage loans, student loans, auto loans, etc. As such, having a healthy credit mix in conjunction with a good payment history shows how well you're able to handle several different loans and lines of credit (LOCs). The New Credit category is perhaps the most straightforward. Having multiple new credit accounts noted on your credit report within a short time period represents a greater risk for lenders, especially if you also lack a lengthy credit history. To qualify for a personal loan with bad credit, you\u2019ll likely need to meet certain criteria. Some of the most important factors are: \"If you\u2019re a borrower with a poor or bad credit score, you probably already know that you aren\u2019t going to get a loan with the best rate or lowest origination fee. But you should still take the time to pre-qualify and compare rates, fees, and other terms. Most of the lenders we evaluated make it easy to pre-qualify and compare, and borrowers should always get a few offers in hand before deciding.\" \u2014Lars Peterson, Senior Editor, Investopedia Financial Products and Services The most common types of bad credit loans aren't all that different from the loan options available for borrowers with good or excellent credit, which are listed below. When shopping for a personal loan for bad credit, these are the most important things to consider when comparing multiple lenders. \"The most important factor when shopping for a loan (and in our research) is loan cost. Eighteen of the 59 personal loan providers we reviewed have maximum advertised APRs of 30% or higher, on top of which they can levy origination fees. To minimize your loan costs, look for lenders with lower maximum APRs, little to no fees, the correct loan amount you need, and shorter repayment terms. You\u2019ll also need to find a provider you have a chance of qualifying for, so keep an eye out for information about minimum credit scores, membership requirements, and whether pre-qualification is available, which will help you shop around.\" \u2014Sana Siddiqui, Research Analyst, Investopedia In Investopedia's 2023 Personal Loan Borrower Survey, we asked respondents to rank loan features on a scale from most important to least important. Almost half of borrowers (48%) ranked the cost of the loan as the most important factor. In a similar survey we conducted in 2022, 39% of borrowers also ranked loan cost as the most important factor. Applying for a personal loan with bad credit is similar to what\u2019s required for any other type of loan, and it's a fairly simple process. \"Payday loans should be avoided if at all possible because they are considered predatory in nature to take advantage of consumers who are in dire financial situations or lack understanding of the costs, repayment terms, and consequences of falling behind in payments. These types of exorbitantly high-cost loans that can top 300% APR are currently only allowed in just over half of U.S. states, which tells how damaging they are in terms of financial public safety.\" \u2014Ben Woolsey, Associate Editorial Director, Financial Products and Services \"A personal loan can be a great tool\u2014but only if it serves a real purpose. If you\u2019re considering a personal loan, make sure you\u2019re clear on why you need it,\" said Ryan Greiser, CFP, a member of Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council. \"If you\u2019re consolidating high-interest debt or making a necessary big purchase, it might be worth it. But don\u2019t get sucked in by easy approvals or flashy ads\u2014personal loans come with interest rates, fees, and potential penalties.\" When it comes to bad credit personal loans, there are four main types of fees that prospective borrowers ought to be prepared for. There are many personal loan scams out there, and it can become even harder to spot red flags when looking at loan products for bad credit. Below is a list of questions a potential borrower should be asking themselves when considering this type of funding: If you suspect you've been the victim of a personal loan scam, contact your local police department and your state Attorney General immediately. Additionally, if the fake lender is located in another country, reach out to the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Investopedia collected and analyzed a wide range of key data points from several bad credit lenders to identify the most important factors for readers choosing the right provider to suit their needs. We used this data to review each company for fees, repayment terms, credit score requirements, and other features to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decision for their needs. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best bad credit loan companies since 2019. Investopedia / Alice Morgan Direct lenders, local lenders, and online lenders are three potential sources that offer personal loans for bad credit. Just be aware that you'll likely pay a higher interest rate than if you had a higher credit score. Digital lending networks allow you to compare online personal loans for bad credit from multiple lenders with one loan application, while direct lenders are the traditional banks and credit unions managing the loans. A local credit union or bank where you already do business might be willing to work with you based on that relationship, even if you have bad credit. The lowest credit score you can get a loan with is actually the lowest credit score you can have (i.e., 300). Granted, having this score will severely limit your lending options. Upstart is one of the few personal lenders that will provide a loan to borrowers with credit scores of 300. That said, even with Upstart, you'll still want as high a credit score as possible in order to get the best interest rate that you can. As with other forms of debt, your student loans will affect your credit score. Making on-time payments on your student debt will help build your credit history (which younger borrowers typically don't have the opportunity to do beforehand) and have a positive impact on your credit score. Conversely, if you fail to make on-time student loan payments, your credit score will decrease as these late or missed payments are added to your credit reports. In order to improve your credit score, first take the time to review your credit reports from each of the three major credit bureaus to ascertain what's keeping your score low (make sure you're receiving your credit reports via soft inquiries, as hard inquiries will lower your score further). If you identify any errors, submit a request to each respective credit bureau to have them corrected, which will help improve your score. The next and best thing you can do to improve your credit score is to make consistent, on-time payments on your existing debts. Other steps you can take include reducing your credit utilization ratio as much as possible, not taking out additional forms of credit until your score improves, and keeping older accounts open (as closing them would reduce your average credit age). It's entirely possible to get a business loan with bad credit. However, having poor credit will limit the financial institutions willing to lend to you, and you'll likely be stuck with a much higher interest rate. The good news is that some bad credit lenders for small businesses will also look at the health of your business when assessing your creditworthiness, improving your chances of qualifying for a more favorable loan. As with a business loan, it's entirely possible to get a home loan with bad credit. One of the best options in this scenario is applying for a loan from a Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-approved lender, as these types of loans are intended for low- and moderate-income borrowers. Prospective FHA loan borrowers will need to have a credit score of at least 500 (which requires a down payment of 10%; a smaller down payment of 3.5% is possible with a score of at least 580), have a DTI of less than 43%, be employed in their current job for six months or longer, and have at least two years of documented work history. Mortgage insurance will also be required, and you'll also have to live in the home as your primary residence. Alternatively, you may be able to qualify for a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan or U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) loan. Neither of these loans requires a down payment, a minimum credit score, or mortgage insurance. This makes them more affordable options than FHA loans, but you'll either have to be a veteran who served for certain periods or under specific circumstances (or be a surviving spouse of a veteran with specific circumstances) or live in an area designated as rural by the USDA, respectively, to be eligible. Medical debt can affect your credit, but unlike most other forms of debt, paying off your medical debt won't have a positive effect on your credit score, as it won't be included in your credit reports. Additionally, if the unpaid debt is less than $500, it won't negatively affect your credit either. However, if your medical bill is over $500 and is later turned over to a collection agency, then you could see some damage to your score. In this case, the unpaid debt would remain on your credit report for up to seven years. We researched and reviewed 59 lenders to find the lenders you see above on this list. While we write individual reviews for many companies, we do not always write reviews for companies we would not recommend.

Investopedia\u2019s list of the best personal loans is based on comprehensive research of 59 lenders. To evaluate and rank personal loan providers, we collected and scored more than 2,600 data points from 59 lenders, including traditional banks, credit unions, fintechs, and finance companies. We researched and evaluated 45 criteria such as APRs, loan amounts and terms, fees, customer experience, and more. Research and data collection occurred from July 23 to Oct. 18, 2024. We organized the 45 criteria into four categories and weighted 26 (involving more than 1,500 data points), using the others for background and editorial richness. We then scored and weighted each criterion to develop our overall star rating for each lender. The categories and their weights for this project are: Learn more about how we evaluated personal loans in our complete methodology.

Her mortgage expertise was honed post-2008 crisis as she implemented the significant changes resulting from Dodd-Frank required regulations. Joules Garcia / Investopedia To help you find a personal loan that meets your needs, we evaluated 59 lenders, reviewing each company\u2019s loan terms, loan costs, borrower requirements, lender features, and more. This guide explains the categories and criteria we used to evaluate each lender\u2019s offerings and our scoring process for determining the best personal loan lenders. Our editors and researchers independently evaluate all recommended products and services. If you click on the links we provide, we may receive compensation. Our advertising partnerships are not a factor in how we evaluate products, although they may affect the order of products you see listed in our articles. We followed a robust data collection and quantitative evaluation process. To identify the lenders to include in our research, we conducted a competitive analysis, reviewed our own research and analysis developed in 2022 and 2023, and analyzed public interest and trends via Google user behavior (such as search volume). This work resulted in the final list of 59 lenders to research and evaluate. We began with media and partner outreach, followed by online research and customer calls to verify and collect details. We collected 45 data points for each of the 59 lenders we identified. This effort resulted in 2,655 total data points. The research, data collection, and verification processes were conducted between July 23 and Oct. 18, 2024. After collection and verification, we then created a quantitative model to score each lender in four major categories across 26 weighted criteria important to people looking for a personal loan. In all, we considered 1,534 data points in Investopedia\u2019s star ratings. Some of the research criteria we collected and didn\u2019t include in the star rating calculations provided additional context for our writers and editors (for example, J.D. Power rankings or hardship programs offered). Others were consolidated into a single weighted criteria (combined consumer review ratings, for example). We used the following method to generate our scores: We arranged the 45 criteria into four categories and weighted them based on insights from industry research and subject matter expertise. As described above, we converted 26 data points to a score between 0 and 1 and assigned weights to each one. A weight of 8%, for example, means that the criterion is worth 8% of the lender\u2019s total score. Our pre-data collection research found that loan costs are very important for borrowers. We weighted this category as 30% of the total score for lenders in our rubric. To evaluate loan costs, we scored and weighted the following features: The interest rate (annual percentage rate, or APR) borrowers pay is the largest component of a loan's cost. Using a continuous scale, we scored lenders on advertised minimum and maximum fixed APRs. The lowest minimum APR we recorded was 5.99% from Reach Financial, earning 1 point. The highest minimum was 18.00%, charged by OneMain Financial, earning 0 points. The weight for the minimum fixed APR is 4% of the total score. The lowest maximum APR in our data is from Alliant Credit Union at 11.49%, earning 1 point. The highest maximum APR we recorded was 295.00% from MoneyKey, earning 0 points. Because MoneyKey and short-term, no-credit-check lenders like it are outliers, we adjusted the continuous scale so that 35.99% earned 0 points. Many lenders adopt 35.99% as their maximum for all borrowers (including 13 of the 59 lenders we researched) because the federal government caps maximum APRs at 36.00% for loans made to military members. The weight for the maximum fixed APR is 9% of the total score. The origination fee can be another significant cost, although 36 of the lenders we evaluated do not charge it. We scored this criterion on a continuous scale. The lowest minimum origination score was 0.00%, earning 1 point for 42 lenders. The maximum origination fee was 12.00%, earning 0 points for Upstart. The weight for the minimum origination fee is 5%, and the weight for the maximum is 7% of the total score. We collected both minimum and maximum penalty fees but only scored the maximum penalty fee to measure how punitive a lender is to borrowers who pay late. We scored this on a continuous scale between 0 and 1. Regions Bank scored 0 points for charging a $100 fee, the highest in our data. Eleven lenders charge no late fee, and each earned 1 point. The maximum late fee weight is 5% of the total score. This category covers details related to the loan itself. We scored four criteria in this category for a total weight of 22%: This is the number of days to receive funds following approval. We scored this criterion on a continuous scale, where the same day (or 0 days) was scored as 1 and seven days, the highest we found, was scored as 0. Eleven lenders scored 1 point for same-day funding. Laurel Road scored 0 points for a funding time of seven days. Funding time is worth 4% of the total score. We collected the minimum loan amount for each lender and scored it on a continuous scale. Lake Michigan Credit Union\u2019s $250 minimum was the lowest in our research and earned 1 point. BHG Financial\u2019s minimum of $20,000 was the highest and earned 0 points. The weight for minimum loan amount is 4% of the total score. BHG Financial\u2019s maximum loan amount of $200,000 was the highest in our research and earned 1 point. Blue Federal Credit Union's maximum loan amount of $10,000 was the lowest, and it earned 0 points. The weight for maximum loan amount is 6% of the total score. We collected data for both minimum and maximum repayment terms but focused the weight on the maximum repayment term length only. That\u2019s because no lenders in our data charge a pre-payment fee, which means borrowers can repay their loans as early as they like, without paying a fee. We scored it on a continuous scale, with the longest term of 240 months (from LightStream) earning 1 point. The shortest maximum term was 60 months, from 28 lenders, earning 0 points. Note, Fig Loans offers an extremely short repayment term of 10 months, which we excluded from our continuous scoring as it is an outlier and distorts the scoring model. The weight for maximum repayment term is 8%. This category represents what lenders seek in a borrower\u2014creditworthiness and other factors. Six of the 26 weighted criteria are in this category, worth 24% of the total score. Most personal loans are unsecured and not backed by collateral. Some lenders allow borrowers to use collateral to help with creditworthiness or to get lower rates. We scored this criterion on a binary scale where lenders that offer secured personal loans, like Patelco Credit Union, earned 1 point, and lenders that do not offer secured loans, like Citibank, earned 0 points. Forty of the 59 lenders we researched do not have a secured personal loan option. This criterion is worth 3% of the total score. Most of the lenders (31 of 59) we researched offer loans nationwide\u2014each of those earned 1 point on a continuous scale. Greenstate Credit Union and Old National Bank both scored 0 points since both are only available in eight states. This criterion is worth 4% of the total score. All of the credit unions in our database and some of the banks require membership to be eligible for a loan. So a credit union like Patelco Credit Union earned 0 points due to its membership requirement, and a fintech lender like SoFi earned 1 point because it does not have such a requirement. This criterion is worth 10% of the total score, which is relatively high. This reflects the exclusivity of the requirement (for a lender like American Express) and the added inconvenience of securing membership before loan application (such as with credit unions). We scored this criterion on a binary scale where a hard credit check requirement earned 0 points and no hard credit check earned 1 point. Most lenders perform a hard credit check at some point during the process\u201453 of the 59 lenders we researched do a hard credit check. Seven lenders in our rubric, including American Express, do not perform a hard credit check during loan approval, which earned them 1 point. This criterion is worth 1% of the total score. Like hard credit checks, some lenders approve loans for borrowers with no credit history. This was also scored on a binary scale, where lenders that offer loans to borrowers with no credit history received 1 point, while those who did not were awarded 0 points. Forty-three lenders we researched, including LightStream and Patelco Credit Union, have no credit history requirement and earned 1 point. The remaining 16, including Navy Federal Credit Union, require a credit history. This criterion is worth 1% of the total score. Lenders look at several aspects of your financial life when approving a loan, including your credit score. In our research, 23 of 59 lenders reported a minimum credit score requirement.\u00a0 We scored this on a continuous scale, where the lowest credit score requirement, 300, from Upstart, earned 1 point, while the highest, 700, from Axos Bank and Old National Bank, earned 0 points. We split lenders that did not report a minimum credit score into two categories: \u201cnot disclosed\u201d for those that did not share any details about their underwriting process and \u201cno stated minimum\u201d for lenders that described their process in some detail. \u201cNot disclosed\u201d earned 0 points, and \u201cno stated minimum\u201d earned 0.3 points on our continuous scale. The minimum credit score is worth 5% of the total score. This category includes 11 of the 26 criteria we scored and is a total weight of 24%. We looked at lender and loan features that are helpful to borrowers: This criterion rates the lender\u2019s online presence, including website usefulness, ease of navigation, organization, design, and more. Our researchers rated each website using a 5-point scale. No lender earned a rating of 5, and just two scored a 4 (Discover and Happy Money); 42 lender websites earned a 3 rating. One lender\u2019s website, Zable, earned a 1 rating. We then converted the results to a continuous scale, where a rating of 1 earned 0 points, and a rating of 4 earned 1 point. We weighted this criterion 2% of the total score. We evaluated the depth and breadth of the educational materials, planning guides, calculators, and other resources on lender websites. First, researchers rated each lender\u2019s educational resources on a 5-point scale. Then, we converted the results to a continuous scale, with the lowest rating of 2 earning 0 points and the highest rating of 5, scored by Navy Federal Credit Union, earning 1 point. Thirty-six lenders scored a 3 or a 4. We weighted it 2% of the total score. Pre-qualification allows borrowers to check rates without a hard credit check (and a hit to their credit scores). We scored this on a binary scale where lenders that offer pre-qualification scored 1 point, and lenders that do not scored 0 points. Forty of the 59 lenders we researched offer pre-qualification, including SoFi and Citibank. Among those that do not offer pre-qualification are LightStream and Old National Bank. This criterion was worth 8% of the total score. We scored this on a binary scale based on whether or not a lender will refinance a loan with a different rate or term, with \u201cYes\u201d earning 1 point and \u201cNo\u201d earning 0 points. Forty-eight of the 59 lenders we researched offer this feature, including Wells Fargo and Patelco Credit Union. Those that do not offer refinancing are U.S. Bank and Rocket Loans. We weighted this as 1% of the total score. For borrowers using a personal loan to consolidate more expensive debt, having the lender pay creditors directly can be more convenient. It can also result in reduced interest rates. We scored this on a binary scale: \"Yes\u201d earned 1 point, and \u201cNo\u201d earned 0 points. Thirty-two of the 59 lenders we researched offer this service, including Discover. Lenders that do not offer this service include LightStream and American Express. We weighted this feature 1% of the total score. A co-borrower or co-signer can help a borrower meet lender underwriting requirements. We scored on a binary scale, with lenders that allow co-signers or co-borrowers scoring 1 point and lenders that do not scoring 0 points. Thirty-six of the 59 lenders we evaluated allow co-signers or co-borrowers, including LightStream and PenFed. Among those that do not are Discover and Wells Fargo. This criterion is worth 3% of the total score. Many lenders offer discounts, such as loyalty discounts for existing customers (for example, Citibank shaves 0.25 percentage points off the APR for Citigold and Citi Priority customers) or repayment discounts for consistent loan repayment (for example, Patelco Credit Union discounts up to 1.5 percentage points off APR for borrowers with reliable payment histories). We scored this on a binary scale, with lenders that offer discounts earning 1 point and those that do not earning 0 points. This is worth 2% of the total score. Most of the lenders in our database report to all three major credit bureaus (49 of the 59, including LightStream and SoFI), but not all do (for example, Patelco Credit Union). Consistent, timely loan repayment can help a borrower improve their credit. This was scored on a binary scale where lenders that report to all three bureaus earned 1 point, and those that do not earned 0 points. This criterion is worth 1% of the total score. We examined whether lenders offer relief for borrowers struggling to make mortgage payments. We scored this on a binary scale where lenders that offer such assistance earned 1 point and lenders who do not earned 0 points. Nearly all of the lenders we evaluated, 54 of 59, offer such assistance. This criterion is worth 1% of the total score. We collected customer ratings of lenders from two third-party review sites: Trustpilot, and the Better Business Bureau (BBB). Since each lender had a different number of ratings at each site, we used weighted averaging combined with an exponential weighting model to create an aggregated customer review rating for each lender. This gave more confidence to ratings with higher numbers of raters. The following data points are included in this combined rating: We converted our aggregated ratings to a continuous scale of 0 to 5. The lender with the highest aggregate customer rating is Upstart, with a rating of 4.9. The lender with the lowest combined consumer review rating is Patelco Credit Union, with a rating of 0.08. Aggregate customer ratings were then scored on a continuous scale between 0 and 1 to contribute to our star ratings, with higher ratings getting better scores. The combined customer review rating is weighted 2% of the total score. When contacted, some lenders were more forthcoming with information than others. We counted the instances of \u201cnot disclosed\u201d in our database for each lender and scored the sum on a continuous scale, with 0 being the fewest (earning 1 point) and six being the most (earning 0 points). We recorded zero \u201cnot disclosed\u201d data points for 41 lenders. This criterion is worth 1% of the total score. The following criteria were collected but not weighted and scored. Some were not weighted because they were collected for editorial richness, such as whether or not the lender has an online application process or a mobile app. Other features, such as third-party details from Trustpilot or Google Reviews, were not weighted individually but combined into an aggregated score. Our research has appeared in dozens of personal loan roundups and reviews on Investopedia. You\u2019ll find it in our roundups of the Best Personal Loans and the Best Personal Loans for Bad Credit. You\u2019ll also find it in individual lender reviews, like our reviews of SoFi personal loans and Upgrade personal loans.

Discover offers fast funding on personal loans, with no origination fees Discover/Investopedia Our Take With fast funding, no origination fees, and flexible repayment terms, Discover personal loans may be a good option for borrowers with strong credit. If you need to borrow more than $40,000, though, consider another lender that offers higher loan amounts.

In addition to its credit card offerings, though, this Illinois-based company provides a variety of financial products, including unsecured personal loans in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. If you\u2019re interested in a Discover personal loan, you can check your rates directly on its website or over the phone. This option to pre-qualify means you can get a sense of your personal loan offers with no obligation or impact on your credit score. Discover/Investopedia Take advantage of pre-qualification by checking your rates with multiple lenders. Our list of the best personal loans is a great place to start. If your credit isn't so great, try the best bad credit loans to find a lender that fits your situation. Discover lets a borrower pay off a personal loan over the course of 36 months to 84 months. Discover offers unsecured personal loans, meaning these loans don\u2019t require you to apply with collateral. Instead, Discover reviews your credit, income, debt-to-income ratio, and other factors when evaluating your loan application. Borrowers with the strongest credit will get the best rates, while weaker-credit borrowers will get worse rates or will not qualify. You can use a Discover personal loan for almost any legal purpose, including: According to Investopedia\u2019s 2023 Personal Loan Borrower survey, debt consolidation is the most common reason cited for getting a personal loan. Paying for home improvements and large purchases were the next two most common reasons. There are some restrictions on how you can use the loan proceeds. You can\u2019t use a Discover personal loan to pay for higher education expenses, or to pay off secured debt or a Discover credit card. If you\u2019re using a Discover personal loan to consolidate debt, you can only consolidate unsecured debt\u2014an auto loan or home loan, for instance, wouldn\u2019t be eligible. Discover can approve your loan the same day you apply as long as your application is not missing any information. If you apply on a weekend, you might have to wait until the next business day to receive a decision. Once your application is approved, Discover can distribute the funds as soon as the next business day via an electronic ACH transfer. If you ask to receive your funds by check, the process will take a little longer. To avoid delays and ensure your loan is processed quickly, follow all the application instructions, review the forms for typos, and double-check that your bank account numbers are accurate. Discover reviews your credit, income, debt-to-income ratio, and other factors when evaluating you for a personal loan. Its minimum required credit score is 660, and its minimum required annual income is $25,000 for an individual or household. You\u2019ll also need to be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident who\u2019s at least 18 years old to get a Discover personal loan. Discover does not allow co-signers or co-applicants for its personal loans. You\u2019ll need to meet the lender\u2019s underwriting requirements for credit and income on your own to qualify for a personal loan. Discover lets you refinance an unsecured personal loan from Discover or another lender, which may be appealing if rates have dropped or your credit score improved since you initially took out the loan. Lowering your interest rate can save you money over the life of your loan. You also can choose new repayment terms. Customer service is available by phone for personal loan applicants and borrowers. Discover draws mixed opinions about its customer satisfaction. Here are the steps to take for seeking a Discover personal loan: Discover allows you to pre-qualify for a personal loan. As a result, you can check interest rates without affecting your credit score or seeing an inquiry show up on your credit report. Discover provides the full suite of banking services: Discover offers flexible personal loans with competitive rates, multiple repayment terms, and zero origination fees in all 50 states. Rated by J.D. Power as one of the best personal loan providers for customer satisfaction, Discover could be an excellent option for borrowers. Discover may have some drawbacks for certain borrowers, though. You can\u2019t apply with a co-signer, for instance, and personal loan limits max out at $40,000. If these rules don\u2019t match what you\u2019re looking for, another personal loan provider could be a better fit. The minimum recommended credit score for a Discover personal loan is 660. That score is considered \u201cfair\u201d by FICO, whose scores are widely used by lenders. In 2023, the average FICO credit score was 715. Discover offers personal loans ranging from $2,500 to $40,000. In the second quarter of 2024, the average U.S. debt for unsecured personal loans was $11,687. No, Discover doesn\u2019t allow its personal loans to be used to directly pay off Discover credit cards. Discover personal loans also can\u2019t go toward paying for post-secondary education or paying off a secured loan (like a mortgage or auto loan). You must have an individual or household annual income of at least $25,000 to qualify for a Discover personal loan. Aside from income, Discover considers a borrower\u2019s debt-to-income ratio and credit history to decide whether to approve a loan application. Most applicants for a Discover personal loan get a decision the same day if their application is complete and no information is missing. To evaluate and rank personal loan providers, we collected hundreds of data points from 59 lenders, including traditional banks, credit unions, fintechs, and finance companies. We researched and evaluated APRs, loan amounts and terms, fees, customer experience, and more.

            "title": "Are Online Loans Legitimate?",
            "content": "Applying for online loans is generally safe, but it is important to work with a trustworthy lender Hispanolistic/Getty Images Online loans can be a fast and convenient way to borrow money. Typically, working with online lenders is safe, but there are unscrupulous lenders out there. This article explains how to find a legitimate lender and spot the warning signs of a possible scam. Some lenders operate only online. Borrowers can apply for a loan and receive the funding without ever going to a physical location. Personal loans are one of the most common types of online loans. Like any traditional lender, online lenders will ask you for personal information to determine your eligibility for a loan. They will review your credit score and credit history before offering you a loan (or turning you down) as well as to set the interest rate and other loan terms. You can get pre-qualified with a few different online lenders to obtain loan estimates, but not firm commitments. This can help you compare your options without undergoing a hard credit check, which can take a few points off your credit score. Once you choose a lender, you'll need to gather whatever documents they ask for, such as your ID and pay stubs, and submit your application online. Loan approval can take just minutes or a few days, depending on the lender. Online loans have some attractive benefits, such as: Many online lenders are safe options, but it is important to confirm their legitimacy before applying. Some ways to do that: Some common red flags can alert you to a potential online loan scam. Among them: The interest rate you'll be offered on a loan will depend on your creditworthiness and prevailing interest rates at the time. You may be able to find more competitive rates with a traditional bank or an online lender, depending on your financial situation. Shopping around will help you find the best interest rate and loan terms. Online loans tend to be fast and convenient, but you will not get the same kind of assistance you would if you apply for a loan in person. Consider your needs, as well as your different interest rate options, before deciding which option works best for you. In an advance fee loan scam, criminals will promise to secure you a loan regardless of your credit history. They will also ask you to pay some kind of upfront fee for your application or loan processing. Unfortunately, the promised loan will never come through. Instead, the scammer will take the money and vanish. Phishing is a type of online identity theft. Scammers may use fraudulent emails or websites to impersonate a trusted individual or business in an attempt to trick you into disclosing sensitive personal information. They can then use that information to steal your identity and money. You can report a loan scam to: You can also get in touch with your local police department and file a report. Online loans can be a quick, convenient option for people who need to borrow money. You may even find that online lenders have lower rates and fees than traditional lenders. Unfortunately, online credit and loan scams are common. So if you haven't already done so, you'll want to educate yourself on the potential warning signs before moving forward.

            "title": "Can You Get a Personal Loan With a 600 Credit Score?",
            "content": "You may qualify for a personal loan with a lower credit score, but expect to pay higher rates Hispanolistic / Getty Images Getting a loan with a low credit score can be more difficult, but there are some lenders that work with borrowers who have FICO credit scores of 600 or even lower. Such loans typically come with higher interest rates, and sometimes extra requirements, but they're a way to obtain money relatively quickly when you need it. Lenders use potential borrowers' credit scores to help evaluate their creditworthiness. You do not need a specific credit score to get a personal loan, but it will be easier to get one with a higher score. An excellent credit score will also make you eligible for a better interest rate on the loan. Lenders often want to see at least a \"good\" credit score, generally considered to be 670 or above. But there are many lenders that offer personal loans for borrowers who have bad credit. If you have a credit score of 600 or lower, any loan that you qualify for will likely come with a higher interest rate and more frees, so the overall cost of the loan will be higher. Lenders that work with borrowers who have lower credit scores may also have additional requirements. For example, you may need to provide collateral for a secured loan, rather than qualifying for an unsecured loan. When you decide you are ready to apply for a personal loan: Some lenders make same-day approval decisions, while others may take a few days. It is typical to receive your loan funds within a few business days of approval. Credit scores generally range from 300 (worst) to 850 (best). It can take time to build or rebuild your credit, but there are steps to take that can relatively quickly improve your score. These lenders offer some of the best personal loans for people with bad credit, according to Investopedia's latest analysis. TD Bank's Fit Loan could be a good option. You can apply with a credit score as low as 300, and you can potentially borrow up to $50,000. TD Bank does not charge an origination fee for this loan. APRs range from 8.99% to 23.99%. But note that this loan is only available in Washington, D.C., and 15 states. Upstart also offers personal loans to borrowers with credit scores as low as 300. The maximum amount that you can borrow is $50,000. APRs range from 7.40% to 35.99%. A personal loan is not your only option if you need to borrow money. You can consider alternatives, such as a credit card, a line of credit, or a salary advance if your employer makes them available. If you own a home you may be eligible for a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC). There is no official minimum credit score for a personal loan, so requirements will vary from lender to lender. In many cases, you will need a credit score of at least 580. But there are lenders that work with people who have lower credit scores. The amount of your loan offer will differ depending on the lender, as well as on factors like your income and credit history. In general, personal loans are often available in amounts up to $50,000. If you have a low credit score, you may be able to get a better interest rate by applying for a secured loan or working with a co-signer. If you aren't in a rush, there are also steps you can take to improve your credit score. While your credit score is important, it is not the only factor lenders consider when evaluating your application for a personal loan. Your income, debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, employment history, and available collateral are also potential criteria. It's possible to get a personal loan with a credit score of 600 or even lower. Consider pre-qualifying with a few lenders to avoid a hard credit inquiry and to compare multiple offers.

            "title": "401(k) Loans vs. Personal Loans: Which Is Right for You?",
            "content": "Each has pros and cons depending on your situation Vladimir Vladimirov/Getty Images A 401(k) loan and a personal loan are two options if you need to borrow money. A 401(k) loan involves borrowing from your retirement account. A personal loan involves borrowing from a lender, such as a bank, credit union, or online lender. Both options have pros and cons. Here's how to decide which one (if either) is right for you. A 401(k) loan can allow you to access a portion of the money in your retirement account, if your employer allows it. Typically, you can use a 401(k) loan for whatever you want to, although some plans may set limitations. Under Internal Revenue Service rules, you can borrow up to 50% of your vested account balance or $50,000, whichever is less. In some cases, if 50% of your vested balance is less than $10,000 you may be able to borrow up to $10,000. Like any other type of loan, a 401(k) loan must be repaid with interest. Your plan administrator will determine the interest rate and the repayment term. In most cases, you will have five years to repay a 401(k) loan and be required to make payments at least quarterly. If you use the loan to purchase a home as your primary residence, you will have a longer repayment period. This period will be determined by your plan administrator. Some employers also offer alternatives to 401(k) loans so their employees can avoid tapping their retirement savings. The potential pros of a 401(k) loan include: The potential cons of a 401(k) loan include: Personal loans give borrowers access to a lump sum of cash that must be paid back in fixed, monthly installments, with interest. This type of loan is usually unsecured, which means borrowers do not have to provide collateral. Personal loans can be used for many different purposes, such as a wedding, medical bills, and home repairs. However, most lenders will not allow you to use one for college tuition. (Of course, there are other loans available for that purpose, such as federal student loans.) The amount of money you can borrow with a personal loan will depend on the lender and your creditworthiness. The maximum amount is typically $100,000. The costs of a personal loan can vary widely from one lender to another, so it's important to shop around and compare interest rates, fees, and repayment terms. The potential benefits of a personal loan include: The potential downsides of a personal loan include: If you are deciding between a 401(k) loan or a personal loan, you'll want to consider: A 401(k) loan is not considered debt because you are borrowing from your own retirement funds. So it will not affect your credit score or debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. You can pay back a 401(k) loan early and in full if you decide to. In most cases, there is no prepayment penalty. If you want to take out more than one 401(k) loan in a 12-month period, the amount you borrow plus your outstanding balance cannot exceed $50,000 or 50% of the total amount in your 401(k). A 401(k) loan means temporarily borrowing money from your retirement account. You will have to pay yourself back over time. A 401(k) withdrawal, on the other hand, permanently removes money from your account. While you don't have to pay the money back, you may be subject to income taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59\u00bd. In addition, you will have that much less money saved for retirement when the day comes. A lender will likely conduct a hard inquiry before offering you a personal loan. This involves obtaining your full credit report and may result in a small dip in your credit score. However, as you make on-time payments, a personal loan can help boost your credit score. A 401(k) loan and a personal loan are two options if you need to borrow money, and both come with pros and cons. It's worth taking the time to consider how much you need to borrow, what that will cost, and how likely you are to be able to repay before applying for any type of loan.

            "title": "Installment Loan vs. Payday Loan: What's the Difference?",
            "content": "Karon Warren has 20+ years of experience researching and writing about banking, mortgages, credit cards, savings, and other personal finance topics. MTStock Studio/Getty Images Installment loans are unsecured personal loans that provide a lump sum of money that you repay over time in fixed monthly installments. Payday loans can provide quick access to cash but come with much higher interest rates and fees. Available through banks, credit unions, and online lenders, installment loans provide a lump-sum amount, which the borrower repays over time with fixed monthly payments. Examples of installment loans include personal loans, car loans, mortgages, and student loans. The application process for an installment loan can take from a few hours to a few days. The amount of the loan can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. How much you will qualify for depends on several factors, including: Once approved,\u00a0you could receive the funds in a matter of hours. Repayment terms can range from a several months to a several years. The interest rate, which is typically a fixed rate, depends on your credit score and history, your income, your existing debt, the loan term and amount, and current interest rates. In general, if you have a strong credit history with a good credit score and a low amount of debt, you could qualify for a lower interest rate than borrowers with poor credit score and a higher level of debt. Every lender has its own minimum credit score requirement, so it's worth finding that out before you apply. Applying for an installment loan will temporarily ding your credit score because the lender will run a hard inquiry on your credit. But if you make your loan payments on time each month, your score should recover quickly and even improve thanks to a history of on-time payments. Installment loans often come with fees that you'll want to ask about when you're comparison shopping. Those can include: Some installment loans do not require collateral. Examples include student loans, debt consolidation loans, and most personal loans. But other types of installment loans do require collateral. For instance, your home usually serves as collateral on a mortgage, while your car serves as collateral on a car loan. Installment loans have both advantages and disadvantages compared with other forms of borrowing. Pros: Cons: Payday loans are very short-term, low-amount loans that provide quick cash. Unlike installment loans, they are not typically available through a bank or credit union. Instead, you have to apply through a storefront payday lender or an online lender. Payday lenders usually don't run a credit check, so your credit score won't take a hit. Also, they don't typically report your loan information to the three major credit bureaus, so neither on-time payments nor missed payments will impact your credit score. However, if you fail to repay the loan, the payday lender could sell the debt to a debt collector or sue you in court for the amount due. These events could be reported, and your credit could take a serious hit. The limits on payday loans can be much lower than on an installment loan. Some states even set a limit on payday loan amounts (and some states outlaw them altogether). A common loan limit is $500. The application process is fairly simple. Typical payday loan requirements are: Funds from a payday loan are often available the same day, possibly within a few hours. Repayment is generally due within two to four weeks. While payment terms usually require a lump-sum payment, it may be possible to roll over the loan for additional time\u2014although that can come at a hefty cost. Fees for payday loans already are hefty. Lenders usually charge a percentage or certain dollar amount for every $100 borrowed. Depending on state law, this fee could be between $10 and $30 for every $100 borrowed. That equates to an annual percentage rate of nearly 400% for a two-week loan. If you're unable to repay the loan on the original due date, your lender may roll it over if you pay the original amount of fees due. For example, if you borrow $400 and pay $15 for every $100 borrowed, the initial fees due would be $60. If you need more time to repay the loan, the lender may charge you $60 and extend the due date for two weeks. At that time, you would have to pay the $400 plus another $60 in fees. Additional fees also could include: There are several other ways to get the money you need that could be a better option than installment loans or, especially, payday loans. Offered by credit unions, payday alternative loans (PALs) are also small loans, typically between $200 and $1,000. Repayment terms can range between one and six months. In addition, fees are limited to a maximum of $20. This can be a much more cost-effective way to get quick cash than a payday loan. However, borrowers must be a credit union member for at least one month before they can apply for a PAL. Credit cards can provide a quick way to cover your expenses, with a longer repayment period than payday loans. However, if you don't pay your balance in full, interest will accrue on the outstanding amount and add up over time.\u00a0You can also obtain a cash advance from a credit card, although you'll owe a cash advance fee and the interest clock on that money will start ticking immediately, with no grace period. Cash advance apps provide funds that are repaid on your payday. While they usually don't charge as much as payday lenders, they may charge fees for subscriptions and instant payments. These typically equate to a high interest rate on an installment loan. Funds usually are transferred to your bank account in one business day, so you could avoid instant payment fees if you can wait 24 hours. If you have family members or friends who are willing to lend you money, you won't have to worry about a credit check or paying fees (or maybe even interest if they're generous). You also could have a more flexible and longer repayment period. But keep in mind that borrowing from family or friends could strain the relationship if you're unable to repay them in a timely manner. A personal loan offers larger potential loan amounts than a payday loan, charges less, and can be repaid over a longer period of time. With revolving credit, such as a credit card, you are approved for a maximum amount of credit, which you can borrow against as needed. You will have to make at least minimum monthly payments and interest will accrue on your outstanding balance. Revolving credit is open-ended, meaning that it has no set end date for full repayment and can continue as long as you keep up with your minimum payments. With an installment loan, you typically receive the money you borrow in a lump sum, which you then repay with fixed monthly payments over a set time period. It is possible to qualify for an installment loan with bad credit from some lenders, but you'll likely pay more than someone with better credit. Installment loans and payday loans are both relatively simple ways to borrow money when you need it. Installment loans tend to have higher borrowing limits and, if you can qualify for one, are likely to be far less expensive than a payday loan. So if you're choosing between the two, try first for an installment loan.

            "content": "Karon Warren has 20+ years of experience researching and writing about banking, mortgages, credit cards, savings, and other personal finance topics. skynesher/Getty Images A personal line of credit (PLOC) is an unsecured loan that allows you to access money as needed up to a pre-approved limit. As with other forms of revolving credit, such as credit cards, you can borrow again and again provided you make the minimum monthly payments and don't exceed your limit. Personal lines of credit are available from many lenders, including banks and credit unions. While the specific requirements will vary from one lender to another, you will likely need a good credit score, a strong credit history, and a steady income. You can apply for a personal line of credit at many banks and credit unions. Because a PLOC is unsecured, you will need a good credit score, strong credit history, and steady income to qualify. Each lender will have its own specific requirements, and you may need to be a member of the credit union or a current customer of the bank to qualify. Once you are approved for a PLOC, you can have funds transferred from the PLOC to your bank account. Some lenders will provide you with personal checks for this purpose, while\u00a0others may allow transfers by phone or online. When you borrow funds from your PLOC, you will have to repay that amount plus interest (unless you repay the balance due in full each month). You only pay interest on the amount you borrowed (or charged), not the full amount of your credit limit. There will be a specific draw period, often lasting several years, during which you can take out PLOC funds. During the draw period, you only have to make minimum monthly payments toward the amount you borrowed, although you can pay more if you wish. Once the draw period ends, the repayment period starts, meaning you will have to repay the entire amount you borrowed within a certain period of time. PLOCs can involve several kinds of payments. Those include: As with some credit cards, PLOCs can charge a number of fees, such as: So when shopping for a PLOC, it's important to review all the terms\u2014not just the interest rate\u2014so you know exactly what it will cost you. Like a credit card, you can use a PLOC for whatever you choose. Examples include: Like other types of borrowing, PLOCs have some pros and cons. Advantages: Disadvantages: Depending on your financial situation you may also be eligible for several other types of credit lines. A home equity line of credit (HELOC) allows you to borrow funds against your home equity (the value of your home minus your mortgage balance). During the draw period, you can use funds for whatever you want. You'll have to make minimum monthly payments toward the balance, and once the repayment period begins, you'll have to make monthly payments that could be higher than those during the draw period. HELOCs also come with a variety of fees. Those can include: This kind of credit line is specifically for business owners. It works like a PLOC, but applying can be much more time-consuming due to the documentation required. Personal lines of credit, personal loans, and credit cards are all ways to borrow, typically without having to provide collateral. Here's a quick look at each:PLOCs: Personal loans: Credit cards: In comparing PLOCs and your other borrowing options, you'll want to consider several key differences. Credit cards work much like PLOCs, but they tend to have higher interest rates and lower credit limits. On the plus side, they don't require any fees to apply and may not have any annual fees if you choose the right one.\u00a0In some cases, you may be able to get a credit card that charges very low or even 0% interest for a certain promotional period. As mentioned above, personal loans are usually unsecured, although secured ones can also be available. A key difference between a PLOC and a personal loan is that with the latter you usually get your money all at once in a lump sum. That can make it more suitable for a single large expense, while a PLOC may be more useful if you expect to be paying a series of bills over a period of time. Home equity loans use your home equity as collateral. You could receive a large lump sum, which you will then repay through fixed monthly payments. Interest rates can be lower than on a PLOC, but if you default on the loan, you risk losing your home. The lender may also have restrictions on how you can use the funds. If you have a 401(k) retirement plan at work and your employer permits it, you may be able to borrow money against your account balance, which you would then repay with interest. If you don't repay the loan as agreed, it could become a plan distribution that's subject to income taxes and possible early withdrawal penalties. In addition, if you leave your job before repaying the loan it could become due right away. Yes, in several possible ways and several possible directions: How much you can borrow depends on your credit, income, and other requirements specific to the lender. Many lenders cap their PLOCs at $25,000, although some will go higher. Interest rates for PLOCs are usually variable, so they can change during the time you're using your line of credit.\u00a0Rates are generally based on an index, such as the prime rate, plus an additional margin to compensate the lender. In September 2024, PLOC rates ranged from just under 9% to well over 20%\u2014further evidence that it can pay to shop around. Each lender has its own minimum credit score requirements, but in general, you may need a credit score of at least 680. A PLOC is typically an unsecured loan, meaning that you don't have to put up any collateral to guarantee it. A HELOC lets you borrow against the equity you have in your home, which also serves as collateral. That means less risk to the lender\u2014who may offer you a better rate on a HELOC than a PLOC for that reason\u2014but also means that you could conceivably lose your home if you're unable to make the payments. A personal line of credit is an unsecured loan that you can access when you need cash for any reason. It may charge less interest than a credit card, but it may also come with costly fees.\u00a0If you are considering a PLOC, be sure to shop around since rates and terms can vary widely. Also, find out when the draw period ends and how long the repayment period runs for to make sure you'll be able to pay it off on time.

            "title": "What Is a Good APR for a Personal Loan?",
            "content": "Interest rates can vary from one lender to another so it's important to shop around VioletaStoimenova/Getty Images When you're looking for a personal loan it's important to compare different lenders' annual percentage rates (APRs), a figure that includes both interest and fees.\u00a0A \"good\" APR is typically one that's at or below the national average at that point in time. But your APR can also vary according to how creditworthy lenders think you are. Here is what you need to know to get a good rate. The annual percentage rate, or APR, is the cost you pay (expressed as a percentage) to take out a personal loan from a lender, which includes the interest rate and any additional fees. For example, if your lender charges an origination fee or an application fee, that amount will be rolled into your APR. If your lender doesn't charge any additional fees, the APR for the loan will be the same as the interest rate. Using the APR is a more accurate way to compare personal loans from different lenders. Think of it as an apples-to-apples comparison. The factors that can affect the APR on a loan include the prevailing interest rates at the time, the length or term of the loan, how much you borrow, whether the loan has a fixed or variable interest rate, and whether it is secured by some form of collateral or unsecured. Your creditworthiness, as perceived by the lender, can also have a major impact on the rates you're offered. Lenders are likely to check your credit reports and credit score and calculate your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) based on the information you supply in your application. If you apply with a cosigner or co-borrower their creditworthiness will be factored in, too. Many lenders may also offer different APRs depending on whether you're applying for a secured or unsecured loan. In general, the more risk a lender thinks you pose, the higher your APR will be. For example, if you have a relatively low credit score combined with a high DTI, you won't get as attractive a rate as someone with a high credit score and a lower DTI.\u00a0In fact you may have difficulty getting a loan at all, except from a lender that specializes in loans for borrowers with poor credit. As an illustration, this table shows the average APRs on personal loans quoted through approximately 19,000 through MoneyLion in August 2024, based on the borrower's credit score range. You can estimate your monthly payments for a personal loan using Investopedia's personal loan calculator. Getting a personal loan with a low APR could save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars in interest costs and fees. One of the best ways you can boost your chances of qualifying for a low APR is to improve your credit score, if necessary. To start, check your credit reports to see what factors may be negatively affecting your credit score and work on improving them. You should also check for any errors and dispute them as soon as possible. By law you're entitled to a free credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus at least once a year. The official website for obtaining all three is AnnualCreditReport.com. Other actions you can take include making consistent on-time payments, avoiding applying for new loans unless absolutely necessary, and lowering your credit utilization ratio (the percentage of your available revolving credit, such as on credit cards, that you're currently using). Other ways you can aim to get a lower APR include: A lender might advertise both an interest rate and an APR for its loans. The interest rate is just that, while the APR includes both the interest rate and any fees, making it a more accurate reflection of what you'll actually pay to borrow. The annual percentage rate, or APR, is the rate lenders charge you to borrow money, effective over a one-year period. The annual percentage yield, or APY, is the interest rate you'll earn in one year from a particular investment. A good interest rate on a personal loan is one that's at or below the national average rate at the time. The interest rate you may qualify for, however, will be based on additional factors like your credit history. Lenders tend to charge whatever the market will bear. Their rates may also vary depending on the types of borrowers they choose to work with. For example, some lenders focus on borrowers with little credit history or a poor credit record and charge higher rates than those that specialize in borrowers who are in a more solid financial position. However, lenders can vary in the rates they charge even identical borrowers, which is why it's important to shop around. APRs for personal loans can fluctuate based on overall economic conditions. The federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve plays a major role, and it can change as often as eight times year, when the board's Federal Open Market Committee meets. While many financial professionals attempt to predict whether rates will go up or down, that is a guessing game at best. Getting the best personal loan for you may require some shopping around. Lenders can differ in the APRs they charge, even when considering borrowers with identical credit profiles. Before you apply, it could also help to check your credit reports and credit score and, if necessary, take steps to improve them.

            "title": "What Is a Share-Secured Loan? Pros and Cons",
            "content": "skynesher/Getty Image A share-secured loan, also known as a savings-secured loan, is a type of personal loan that's secured by the money in your bank or credit union account. If your loan application is approved, the financial institution will freeze that amount in your account as collateral. This type of loan can be easier to obtain than many others, especially if you're just starting to build a credit history. Financial institutions that offer share-secured loans allow you to use money in your accounts with them\u2014 such as a savings or money market account\u2014as collateral for a personal loan. You're most likely to find these types of loans at credit unions, where savings accounts are often referred to as \"share accounts\" and checking accounts as \"share draft accounts.\" The amount you put up as collateral will be frozen by the lending institution but may still earn interest while you're paying back the loan. Depending on the terms of your loan, you may get access to your collateral only after you've paid off the entire balance, or it may be released a bit at a time as you're making payments. Since you're putting up your own cash, lenders may be more willing to extend credit or offer a better interest rate because of the lower risk. Depending on the lender, you might be able to borrow as much as 100% of your collateral or some lesser amount. If you fail to make payments and default on the loan, the lender has the right to keep your cash. Like other types of borrowing, share-secured loans have both advantages and disadvantages. A share-secured loan may be a good choice if you have poor or limited credit and want to build your credit history. Since it's easier to qualify for than many other types of loans, you may not have to go through a lengthy application and approval process, meaning you could get the money relatively quickly. However, if you need a large loan amount or have good credit, you may want to consider other alternatives. Share-secured loans aren't for everyone. Possible alternatives include: The amount you need to keep on deposit in a share-secured loan will vary from one lender to another and by how much you want to borrow. In many cases, you'll need at least several hundred dollars. In general, the rates on share-secured loans tend to be significantly lower than on other types of personal loans, especially unsecured ones. Your loan activity will typically be reported to the credit bureaus each month. According to the credit bureau Experian, it generally takes at least six months to establish a FICO credit score, the most widely used type, although FICO competitor VantageScore can create a score for you as soon as your lender files its first report. Yes, you can. For example, some financial institutions offer securities-backed lines of credit (SBLOCs), where you put up shares of stock as collateral. Brokerage firms also offer margin loans based on the value of your portfolio, typically for buying additional investments but sometimes for other needs. A certificate-secured loan is like a share-secured loan but uses a certificate of deposit (CD) at the lender as collateral. A share-secured loan can be an effective way to build credit. These loans are relatively easy to qualify for and their interest rates tend to be lower than those on many other types of loans. Since you're putting money up as collateral, you're at risk of losing it if you can't pay back the loan. If you decide this type of loan is right for you, be sure to shop around to compare rates and terms.

            "title": "Personal Loan Scams to Watch Out For",
            "content": "Kindamorphic/Getty Images Personal loan scams can be costly for unsuspecting consumers who fall victim to them. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) estimates that fraud and identity theft\u2014including personal loan scams\u2014cost consumers $10 billion in 2023 alone. Reports of identity theft involving personal and business loans increased by 7% from the previous year. If you're considering a personal loan for debt consolidation, large expenses, or any other purpose , knowing how to recognize a potential scam is crucial. Personal loan scams can take different forms and many of them appear quite convincing. There are, however, typically some giveaways that a loan offer or a lender is not legitimate. Here are some of the most prevalent scams to be aware of. Advance-fee loans defraud consumers by requiring them to pay a fee before any loan funds are released. For example, you might be asked for a processing fee, an application fee, or an insurance fee. You send the money in good faith, only to find out that there is no loan and the person who collected the fee from you has disappeared. Scammers often target people who may be searching for bad-credit loans or loans that don't require a credit check. They count on people being willing to pay a fee either because they're desperate to borrow or don't understand how loan fees work. Loan and lease scams were the third most commonly reported type of identity theft incident in 2023, according to the FTC. Phishing and identity theft scams involving personal loans rely on people giving access to their personal or financial information, either knowingly or unknowingly. Anyone may be a target\u2014retirees, college students, military members\u2014scammers don't discriminate. Here's how this type of scam might work. Use caution when sharing personal or financial information with anyone you don't know over the phone, via email, or through text message. Debt relief scams and credit scams target people who may be struggling with debt and are unsure of how to manage it. Scammers may send you a preapproved loan offer to help you consolidate debt, but before you can get the money you must first pay a processing fee. You hand over the money but no debt relief ever materializes. Fake lender websites may look like the real thing, but they're designed to defraud consumers who visit them looking for loans. These scams often overlap with advance-fee loan scams and phishing or identity theft scams in that you might be asked to pay an upfront fee or be required to share your personal and financial information to apply. Some easy ways to spot a phony website include a domain name that doesn't match the site name, the lack of an SSL certificate, and little to no contact information. Some warning signs of a personal loan scam are easier to spot than others. Here are some of the biggest red flags to watch out for. A common scam tactic revolves around putting pressure on the victim to act quickly. Scammers may tell you that you could miss out on a limited-time offer, leading you to make a rushed and uninformed decision. Beware of any lender that attempts to pressure or intimidate you into applying for a loan or paying an upfront fee. No-credit-check loans with guaranteed approval can be attractive for borrowers with poor credit, but those offers aren't always legitimate. Most reputable lenders require some type of credit check or approval process to verify your identity and determine how likely you are to repay what you borrow. As the timeless advice puts it: Any promises or guarantees that seem too good to be true most likely are. Some loans do require the payment of fees upfront. If you're getting a mortgage, for example, you'll need to pay closing costs before the lender turns over the funds. Personal loans may also have upfront fees. Lenders may charge an origination fee, for example, which covers the cost of processing your loan. This type of fee, however, is typically paid out of the loan proceeds, not your pocket. If a lender requests a large fee directly from you in order to receive loan, that's a good indicator that it may be a scam. Personal loan scammers may ask for upfront payments using nontraditional means, such as Cash App, Venmo, or cryptocurrency. Reputable lenders will clearly detail their credentials and licensing on their websites. This information is typically included as a footnote near the bottom of the page, or on the site's About page. If you visit a lender website and you're not able to easily locate their business license and registration information, that could be a sign it's not a genuine operation. You can also reach out to your state attorney general's office or business registration office to confirm whether a lender is legit. Along with registration information, legitimate lenders should display their contact information, including their phone number and address, online. If you don't see this information or the only way to get in touch with the lender is through a generic contact form, that could be a giveaway that you're dealing with a scammer. Secure websites will have \"https\" in their address. If you don't see that at the beginning of the website's URL it could suggest a potentially fraudulent site. At a minimum, it means that the website is not secure and that any information you enter into online forms could be at risk of being compromised. Often scammers don't wait for you to come searching for a personal loan. Instead, they come looking for you. You might be dealing with a personal loan scammer if you're receiving unsolicited loan offers via email, text, phone, or conventional mail. If you need a personal loan, it's better to do your own research to find a lender to work with. Comparing rate quotes and terms, and evaluating a lender's credentials yourself, can ensure that you're working with a verified company, as well as get you the best deal. If you think you're being targeted by a personal loan scam or that you've already fallen victim to one, it's important to take action. Here's what you can do to protect yourself. If you're concerned that someone might try to use your information to commit fraud or identity theft, consider freezing your credit reports. A credit freeze blocks new accounts from being opened in your name without your consent. Legitimate lenders will have secure, encrypted websites that display their licensing and registration information, as well as their contact information. They won't use high-pressure tactics to get you to agree to a loan or require you to pay high fees upfront using nontraditional methods, such as person-to-person payment apps or cryptocurrency wallets. Scammers can take out personal loans in someone else's name if they have their personal information, including their name, date of birth, and Social Security number. Identity thieves routinely use phishing scams to try and trick consumers into handing over sensitive information which they can then use to open fraudulent credit accounts. Online personal loans are safe if you're working with a verified, reputable lender. Learning how to recognize personal loan scams can help you avoid untrustworthy lenders. If you think you've shared sensitive information with a scammer you can report it to your local authorities, the FTC, and the CFPB. You can also monitor your bank and credit card accounts for suspicious activity and alert those financial institutions. If you're worried about fraudulent charges, you might consider locking your debit card and credit cards, or initiating a credit freeze. If a loan is in your name because someone stole your identity, you'll have to be able to prove to the lender that the debt doesn't belong to you. If your name is on a legitimate loan as a co-signer with someone else, the only way to remove it may be refinancing the loan. Refinancing would require the other person to get a new loan in their name only that pays off the existing loan amount. Personal loan scams continue to target victims, as scammers and identity thieves become more savvy in their methods. Being aware of the chief markers of a personal loan scam and carefully researching lenders can help you avoid becoming a target. As you shop for the best personal loans, look for a lender that's transparent and willing to answer any questions you might have before applying.

            "title": "What Is a Green Loan?",
            "content": "Borrowers can use green loans to fund environmentally beneficial projects Halfpoint Images/Getty Images A green loan is a loan from a government or financial institution to fund a project that is expected to have a positive environmental impact. These loans must adhere to four green loan principles (GLPs), a set of guidelines administered by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA). Companies can use them as part of their overall environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy. Green loans are intended to finance or refinance environmentally focused projects, also referred to as green projects. Green loans can be any type of loan instrument, such as a term loan or revolving credit facility, that adheres to the GLPs. A variety of financial institutions, including banks and credit unions, offer green loans to individuals and businesses. Borrowers can also work with green banks, or financial institutions that focus on financing driven by the mission to fight climate change. The U.S. government also offers loan programs that businesses can leverage to fund green projects. For example, the Green Lender Initiative was established to add more climate lenders to the Small Business Administration (SBA) loan programs. Both individuals and businesses can become green loan borrowers. Qualification requirements for a green loan will depend on the lender or loan program and the details of the project. Green loans offer borrowers a way to demonstrate their commitment to green initiatives, such as sustainable practices or reducing carbon emissions. For lenders, green investing supports projects that have a positive environmental impact. The GLPs are a framework that helps lenders and borrowers understand what can be considered a green loan. The four principles are: The first principle relates to how borrowers can use the loan funds. Borrowers should demonstrate the project to be funded has clear environmental benefits, such as conservation or climate change mitigation. Under the second GLP, borrowers should communicate the environmental objectives of the green project they wish to have funded. Borrowers are also encouraged to identify and communicate any potential risks and mitigations for negative environmental or social impacts. Once a green loan is funded, borrowers are expected to track the use of the proceeds and maintain transparency in that process. In accordance with the fourth GLP, borrowers are expected to report on the use of the loan proceeds and the actual impact of their projects' goals. The reported information is typically reviewed annually until the loan is fully drawn. The definition of a green project can vary. These are some examples: Personal green loans can fund projects such as: Businesses may seek green loans for purposes such as: What are the benefits of green loans for the stakeholders involved? Green loans can help borrowers: Offering green loans can help lenders: Green loans have the potential to fund projects that: Borrowers must adhere to the green loan principles (GLPs) to secure a green loan. That includes using the proceeds to fund a green project and meeting specific reporting requirements. A traditional loan, such as a business or personal loan, typically has more open-ended guidelines for how the funds may be used. Lenders offer green loans specifically to fund environmentally focused projects. ESG loans are a broader category than green loans. ESG loans typically do not have limitations on the use of the proceeds. Instead, this type of loan incentivizes borrowers to improve their ESG performance. If borrowers demonstrate improvement on certain ESG metrics, they can potentially reduce the price of the loan. Green bonds and green loans can serve similar purposes, but green bonds tend to be larger and have higher transaction costs. Green loans are executed privately, while green bonds may be executed privately or placed on an exchange. Greenwashing refers to the deceptive practice of promoting a project as green when it is not. A company may be accused of greenwashing if it does not use the proceeds of a green loan to fund an environmentally friendly project or if it does not clearly report on the funded project's environmental impact. Any type of borrower has the opportunity to apply for a green loan, but they must adhere to the GLPs when using the funds. Green loans can have a positive impact on the environment when used in accordance with the GLPs. If borrowers and lenders do not adhere to green principles, they run the risk of being justifiably accused of greenwashing.

            "title": "What Is a Flex Loan? Benefits and Drawbacks",
            "content": "Flex loans can offer quick access to cash, but there are potential risks Flex loans are a line of credit that borrowers can use to get access to cash. The lender sets a credit limit, and you can borrow up to that amount, much like you would with a credit card. You will pay interest on the money you borrow, typically at relatively high interest rates. When you take out a flex loan, you can access a line of credit. You can borrow against that line of credit and repay what you borrow with interest. With an open line of credit, you can continue to borrow up to your credit limit as needed. In most cases, you can pay more than your required minimum monthly payment without any penalties to pay the debt off faster. A flex loan is usually an unsecured line of credit, which means you do not have to put up one of your assets, such as your car, for collateral. While you do not risk losing an asset, the lender assumes more risk if you do not repay what you borrow. As a result, flex loans typically come with higher annual percentage rates (APRs). The APR on a flex loan reflects your borrowing cost, including fees. APRs can be useful when comparing offers from various lenders. The higher the APR, the more expensive the cost of borrowing. You may be able to secure a flex loan with an APR in the 24% to 28% range today, but APRs can reach the triple digits in some cases. Flex loans can be an appealing option for some borrowers. Their plusses include: It is also important to consider the potential downsides and risks of using a flex loan to get access to cash. Among them: A flex loan can be a good option in certain situations. If you have inconsistent income, a flex loan can help you cover your expenses while you wait to get paid. If you need help covering an unexpected expense, a flex loan can also help. This option may be particularly attractive to people who wouldn't quality for other kinds of loans due to poor credit. Before you decide to get a flex loan, consider your ability to repay it. Will you be able to do so in a relatively short period of time, or will you need to keep borrowing against the line of credit? It is possible that continued borrowing and making only the minimum payments could lead to a significant amount of debt. If you need to borrow, you can consider multiple options. They include: Lenders often do not conduct a hard credit inquiry when you apply for a flex loan, which means the application process will not impact your credit. But your borrowing activity on the flex loan could be reflected on your credit reports. Late payments or defaulting on the flex loan could negatively impact your credit score in a serious way. While flex loans and payday loans both promise quick access to cash, they work differently. The amount you can borrow with a payday loan is based on your anticipated income. The amount you can borrow via a flex loan is determined by a credit limit based on multiple factors. Both options typically come with high interest rates and fees. You will need to make minimum monthly payments on your flex loan. You can also pay back more than the minimum, which allows you to get out of debt faster or replenish your credit line and borrow more in the future. You can borrow and repay indefinitely up to your credit limit because flex loans are open lines of credit. If you cannot make the minimum payments, you will default on your flex loan. Defaulting on a loan comes with the risk of your debt being sold to a collection agency and legal claims against you. Defaulting on a flex loan could also seriously damage your credit score. The maximum amount you can borrow with a flex loan will be determined by the credit limit set by the lender. You may be able to borrow hundreds or thousands of dollars, depending on the lender and your financial situation. Flex loans can be an easy way to access cash if you have poor credit and need the funds to cover a gap in your income or an unexpected expense. However, it is important to consider the amount of interest you will pay and your ability to repay what you borrow. If a flex loan makes sense for you, you should compare offers from a few different lenders. If you are concerned about the risks of taking on a flex loan, you can explore alternatives, such as a personal loan or borrowing from a friend or family member.

            "content": "You may qualify for a loan with a 450 credit score or below, but be cautious of interest rates, fees, and risky terms SDI Productions / Getty Images Unfortunately, getting a loan from a direct lender can be difficult when you have a credit score of 450. or below You might be able to find a lender that will provide you with a loan, but the terms can be risky and will likely include high interest rates and fees. Here\u2019s what you need to know if you have poor credit and want to apply for a loan. A 450 or below credit score is considered a bad score. Credit scores run from 300 to 850, with those closer to 300 considered poor and 850 considered exceptional. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) puts scores into ranges that categorize you according to where your score falls: However, each credit reporting agency has its own categorization. As such, the ranges tend to be a little different for each institution. FICO uses the following categories for its scores: While these ranges are usually slightly different for scores based on other models, 450 is still typically considered poor (or some other similar term). When you have a 450 credit score or below, lenders will take that as a sign that you\u2019ve had problems with debt in the past. It could indicate that you\u2019ve missed payments or defaulted on loans, or even that you\u2019ve declared bankruptcy or been through a foreclosure. Even though some direct lenders will provide you with personal loans when you have bad credit, it can be difficult to find one that will lend to you if you have a credit score of 450 or lower. In some cases, though, you might be able to find a loan with a lender that doesn\u2019t rely on credit scores to provide funding. For example, some companies that might provide you with a loan without a hard credit inquiry include: You may have other options available to you, but many unsecured bad-credit personal loans require a credit score of at least 500 or 550 to qualify, which means that a 450 credit score would likely disqualify you in those cases. Before you get a personal loan from a direct lender with a credit score of 450 or worse, it\u2019s important to understand that you could be subject to risky terms. Here are some things to keep in mind about loans when you have poor credit: You might need to consider other borrowing options if you have poor credit. Depending on what you\u2019re trying to accomplish with your loan, the following alternatives might also meet your needs. However, these alternatives might not provide you with the amounts you\u2019re looking for, and they can still come with high rates and fees. You need to improve your credit score to access more borrowing options. A secured credit card can help you boost your score, as long as the credit card issuer reports to the credit bureaus. Look for secured cards or loans, as well as other types of bad-credit loans that report to bureaus and can potentially help you improve your score. Beyond that, you can improve your score by paying down your debt and making sure your other payments are made on time. Create a plan to tackle your debts, and you can start seeing your score improve in a few months. Every bank has its own set of criteria for lending. Banks can approve a loan for any credit score, including 450, or lower if it is willing to take on the risk and if it fits within their underwriting requirements. In general, you\u2019re likely to get a relatively small loan with a credit score of 450. Many direct lenders might be reluctant to offer a bigger loan if they\u2019re concerned that you won\u2019t be able to repay it. It\u2019s hard to say what provider is easiest to get a personal loan from, but some companies like Upstart and Fig Loans offer access to amounts without using traditional credit requirements. Payday loans are generally easier to get, but they often come with high rates and fees, in addition to risky repayment terms. You could end up trapped in a debt cycle if you use these types of loans. Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, to Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. Even though some lending options are available for those with credit scores of 450 and lower, they are hard to find. They can also be risky and costly. If possible, it might make more sense to look for other ways to fund your needs and work toward improving your credit score so you\u2019ll be able to access the best personal loan options.

            "content": "It can be more difficult, but it's still possible. Here is what you need to know. Peter Muller / GettyImages When you apply for a personal loan, most lenders will check your credit history and current employment. But what happens if you need to borrow money while you're unemployed?\u00a0You might still be able to get a personal loan under those circumstances, but you could have more hoops to jump through compared to someone who is working. An emergency loan for bad credit may be an option, and it's smart to first learn all you can about applying for a loan while unemployed. For most personal loan lenders, checking that you have a reliable income is part of the approval process. The lender wants to make sure you can repay your loan within the agreed-upon time frame. If you're unemployed, that can raise some serious questions about your ability to pay back your debt. Here are some steps to take before you apply: If you've lost your job and you're hoping to take out a personal loan for everyday expenses, it's worth calculating exactly how much you'd actually require. Determine what it'll take to cover your needs for the next few months, or however long you expect to be without a paycheck. That way you can aim to borrow enough to pay your expenses while you're unemployed but not go into any more debt than necessary. Adding another bill to your budget while you're unemployed is an extra financial burden. So when thinking about your monthly expenses, be sure to include to cost of the loan repayments. If you have any doubts about your ability to repay your loan, you might want to consider some alternatives. You can pull your credit report for free from all three of the major credit bureaus at AnnualCreditReport.com. Comb through each report to see if there are any errors and dispute them as soon as you can. Try to clean up your credit report before submitting a loan application. You can usually obtain your credit score through your bank, credit card issuer, or other lender you have a relationship with. There are also online resources for checking your credit scores for free. This will give you an idea of what lenders will see when they pull your credit report. It can also help you figure out which lenders to compare, as some have minimum credit score requirements, and they can vary heavily. Even without a current job, you can prove the last time you earned a paycheck with your most recent pay stubs or W-2 forms. You can also show other types of income through tax returns, bank statements, and other official documents. Some lenders will ask you what you intend to use the loan for, while others won't. Your answer can, in some cases, affect the amount of your loan, the interest rate, or both. There's a good chance you might not qualify for a personal loan on your own when you're unemployed and lack sufficient income from other sources. If that's the case, you may want to consider getting a co-signer. A co-signer is someone who signs onto your loan just as you do and is ultimately responsible for it. If you fall behind on payments, and the co-signer doesn't make them for you, both of you will suffer a serious drop in your credit scores. Only go this route if you and your co-signer have worked out a clear plan about who will be paying off the loan. Most personal loans are unsecured. Secured personal loans let you back your loan with collateral, like a savings account or certificate of deposit (CD). If you can't get an unsecured loan because you're unemployed, there's a chance you could qualify for a secured one. Bear in mind that you might not get the same interest rates, borrowing options, or repayment terms as with an unsecured personal loan, but if you need the money for an emergency or to cover basic needs, a secured loan could be a good option. Lenders look at a few key factors when reviewing your application, including: Each lender weighs these factors differently, but they all hold some significance in your application. The higher your credit score, the more likely you are to qualify for a personal loan for the amount you need at the lowest available interest rate. Having fair or even poor credit doesn't mean you won't qualify, but you may have a harder time getting the full amount you've requested or securing a good interest rate. If you have a history of unpaid debt or late payments on your credit report, that could hurt your chances of getting approved. It is also the single most important factor in determining your credit score. While being employed is one way to prove you have a source of income, it isn't the only one. You may have other sources of income, such as: Your DTI ratio shows how much of your income goes toward paying off your debts. A high DTI ratio suggests to lenders that it could be difficult for you to make payments on a new loan. A low DTI suggests that even if something happens, you could likely repay your loan. Different lenders have different DTI requirements. If you're unemployed, there are a number of sources worth checking out when you're thinking of applying for a personal loan. In addition to traditional banks, you might want to consider: Even if you don't belong to a credit union right now, you can look into credit union emergency loans. Use the credit union locator to find one near you and see if you're eligible based on its requirements. PenFed Credit Union, for example, will evaluate your income depending on your personal situation. So you may have to turn over bank statements or tax returns instead of pay stubs. Federal credit unions offer payday alternative loans (PALs) with amounts ranging from $200 to $1,000, but you'll need to be a credit union member for at least a month before you can take out one of these. Loan terms range from one to six months. Their annual percentage rates (APRs) are capped at 28%, while other loans from federal credit unions are capped at 18%. But even at 28%, PALs may be an attractive option compared to loans from private payday lenders, which can carry costs and fees approaching 400% in some states. You can get a personal loan from many different banks or lenders, such as U.S. Bank, Old National Bank, Teachers Federal Credit Union, NASA Federal, and more. You can check with your financial institution, too. So if you have a NASA Federal account already, you may find that NASA Federal also has personal loans. Some lenders don't have any income verification processes, which makes it easier for you to get a loan based on other merits, like your credit score or credit history. With Upgrade, for example, if you get approved for a loan and accept the terms, you could receive funds in as little as a day. Keep in mind that online lenders often charge an origination fee and have a higher maximum APR compared to other lending options, such as credit unions. If you can't get a personal loan because you're unemployed, you might have some other options, including: Less formally, you might also want to ask friends and family if they'd be willing to lend you some money to cover immediate costs. It's a good idea to still treat this like an actual loan, including getting everything in writing, to ensure that both you and the lender are on the same page. Additionally, make sure you pay back a loan from a friend or family member within the agreed-upon time frame, otherwise you risk damaging your relationship. Different lenders will have different minimum credit score requirements. In some cases, you can find their requirements online. Otherwise, you may need to inquire before applying. Depending on your resources, you might qualify for government assistance, whether that's help with bills or paying for food, for example. These are not loans but money you simply don't have to pay back. Yes, many of the best personal lenders offer fund disbursement as soon as the same day or within a day or two. Every bank, credit union, and online lender has a different approval process. Online lenders offer the quickest and easiest application process, and in some cases, you can find out whether you qualified almost immediately. People with the highest credit scores and with a long history of responsible credit use are the ones most likely to be approved for a personal loan. But that doesn't mean you can't get approved for a loan if you don't meet those qualifications, you may just have to work with specific lenders and/or be saddled with a high interest rate. Taking on additional debt while you're unemployed can be risky and should usually be avoided, if possible. But if you need to take out a personal loan, you may have some options.

            "title": "No Credit Check, No Problem: You Can Still Get a Signature Loan",
            "content": "But It Will Likely Cost You Much More Moyo Studio / Getty Images It's entirely possible to get a signature loans with no credit check, which may seem like a good idea in theory, but borrowing money this way can be far more expensive than other options. Because lenders have to make loans without the benefit of checking the applicant's credit score and knowing their borrowing history, these loans tend to be pricier than normal loans and with more fine print. If you're considering a signature loan with no credit check, you should know how these loans differ from other funding options, such as traditional unsecured personal loans, and how much more they may cost you. A signature loan is a type of loan that only requires your signature and promise to pay. They generally have lower rates than credit cards and higher rates than loans secured with an asset as collateral. Signature loans can include unsecured personal loans. A signature loan with no credit check is essentially a payday loan complete with risky terms. As with traditional unsecured loans, payday loans don't require collateral, yet interest rates on these loans can easily be over 400%\u2014however, their interest rates can be capped by state law. Some states don't allow payday lending at all. Signature loans with no credit check are also offered in much smaller amounts than typical personal loans, the best of which may offer up to $50,000 or even higher, depending on the lender. For payday loans, you're usually limited to borrowing $500 or $1,000, although some lenders offer loans for up to $10,000. Finally, signature loans with no credit check may require you to pay back the money in a much shorter time frame, such as within two weeks or a couple of months. In contrast, traditional personal lenders often let you pay a loan off in 24 to 84 months. Payday lenders usually want you to pay the money back in a lump sum, typically on your regular payday. So they're not a good option for borrowing money for the long term. Get funding regardless of your credit score Few approval requirements Solve financial problems in the short term Expensive Can create a cycle of debt No credit building Because of their expensive nature, signature loans with no credit check generally aren't worth it unless you have no other option. Almost any other loan type or credit card will put you in a better financial position and charge lower interest rates and fees as you pay the money back. A few things to remember about signature loans with no credit check: There are some alternatives available to you if you have bad credit and need cash fast. Consider these borrowing options if you find yourself in this situation: Before you apply for a payday loan or any other loan, you should check your credit score and credit history to see where you stand. This step can help you figure out whether you can qualify for a traditional loan with decent terms, or if you could qualify for other financial products like a credit card. Some lenders also let you pre-qualify for a loan, which is when you get estimated terms you would qualify for without impacting your credit score. You can check your annual credit report for free at AnnualCreditReport.com. Finally, for any loan offer you receive, make sure you understand the interest rates and fees. Additionally, avoid situations where you're borrowing money you don't need, and make sure that you have a plan to pay the money back. Approval requirements for signature loans vary based on the lender and whether a credit check is required. For example, signature loans with no credit check are available for almost anyone who meets basic eligibility requirements. However, many traditional loans require a credit score of 600 or higher to be approved. Payday loan amounts vary, but many have maximums of $500. Some lenders may let you borrow a few thousand dollars if you can prove your ability to repay. There are numerous reasons you may need to borrow money without using collateral, even with high-cost options like payday loans that don't require a credit check. For example, these loans may be useful for emergency car repairs, home repairs, medical and dental emergencies, and more. If you've been looking for signature loans for bad credit and wondering how much they will cost you, you should know that loans lacking a credit check requirement can be expensive. With that in mind, the best signature loans for bad credit are the more traditional kind that charge interest rates up to 35.99% and offer repayment terms that last up to several years. The tradeoff of these loans is that they do require a credit check, so if you have poor credit, you could be stuck with a higher interest rate or denied funding altogether.

            "title": "Personal Loans vs. Credit Cards: What's the Difference?",
            "content": "Compare the pros and cons of personal loans and credit cards Pekic / Getty Images Personal loans and credit cards both offer a way to borrow money for any purpose you choose. While they share many of the same features, there are also some important differences, such as what they cost and how they need to be repaid. Here is how the two compare. Investopedia / Lara Antal Banks, credit card companies, and other lenders will look at a number of factors when deciding whether to approve you for credit. Your credit score is among the most important ones. It is based on your past credit history, including your record of on-time payments, how much debt already have outstanding, and whether you've ever defaulted on a loan. The three major U.S. credit bureaus\u2014Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion\u2014compile credit reports on individual borrowers, which are then used to calculate their credit scores. Credit reports do not include any information about your income, so lenders will typically ask you about that separately in your loan or credit card application. They may use it to calculate your debt-to-income ratio (DTI), which can be another important factor in their decision. With a personal loan, lenders provide you with a lump sum of money that you repay over time, typically with fixed monthly payments. This is known as an installment loan. A personal loan will have a fixed term as well, often of a few years, but sometimes longer or shorter. Personal loans do not offer ongoing access to funds like a credit card does, but they usually have lower interest rates, especially for borrowers with a good to high credit score. A personal loan can be used for any purpose. For example, you can use it to buy new appliances, consolidate credit card debt, repair or upgrade your home, or pay for a vacation. Personal loans are typically unsecured, meaning they are not backed by collateral. Secured personal loans can be available, as well. Personal loans often charge an origination fee and may have other fees as well. This can add to their total cost. Can provide funding for large purchases Usually offers a lower interest rate than a credit card Has predictable fixed payments Often includes fees that can add up Does not provide more credit after the lump sum Does not offer rewards, as many credit cards do In 2023, Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds or might use a loan in the future. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvements and other large expenditures. Instead of a lump sum of cash, credit cards offer revolving credit, providing borrowers with ongoing access to funds that they can draw on as needed, up to an agreed-upon credit limit. As they charge purchases to their card, their available credit goes down. As they repay, it goes up again. This can go on indefinitely. Unlike a personal loan, with a credit card, you pay interest only on the funds you use. And if your credit card has a grace period, as cards typically do for new purchases (but not cash advances), you can avoid paying any interest at all if you pay your balance in full each month. Also, unlike personal loans, where your monthly payment is usually the same over the entire repayment period, your credit card bill can vary each month depending on any new charges and any leftover balance from previous months. You will be expected to make at least a minimum payment each month, but if that's all you pay, your balance can grow quickly, accruing interest all the while. Many credit cards offer benefits like cash rewards or a 0% introductory period. However, if you run a balance, they typically have much higher interest rates than personal loans. And some have monthly or annual fees. Most credit cards are unsecured, but borrowers with poor credit or no credit history may be eligible for a secured credit card, which requires a deposit that serves as collateral. Ongoing revolving credit line Only charges interest on the amount you use Can avoid interest altogether if you pay your bill in full May offer benefits like 0% introductory interest rates and cash-back rewards Interest typically is higher than on personal loans Interest and fees can add up and create a cycle of debt if balances accumulate Personal loans and credit cards are just two ways to borrow money if you need to. Here are some alternatives that may be more appropriate in some situations: The monthly cost of a $5,000 personal loan will depend on the interest rate and term length. You can use an online personal loan calculator to determine the monthly cost of loans with different terms. You may be turned down for a personal loan if your credit score is too low, if your income is not high enough if you are carrying too much debt, or if you fail to meet any of the lender's other requirements. Applying for a personal loan may result in a small, short-term hit to your credit score. Once you have the loan, how well you keep up with the payments will affect your score in a more significant way. If you make all the required payments on time, your score can benefit. If you don't, your score can decline. Both personal loans and credit cards make it relatively easy to borrow money when you need it\u2014and to get into credit trouble if you aren't able to repay what you owe. In deciding between the two, you'll want to compare their interest rates, fees, and other details. Whichever you opt for, be sure to shop around, as lenders' terms can vary, even for the very same financial products.

Advertised personal loan rates are stated as a range of annual percentage rates (APRs) that lenders offer on their websites to borrowers of all credit quality ranges. Investopedia tracks and maintains a database of the advertised minimum and maximum APRs provided by 70 national lenders every month. Several factors determine personal loan interest rates, including borrower creditworthiness, income, amount borrowed, and the length of the loan. Other factors can also influence each lender's personal loan pricing, such as the availability and cost of lendable funds, delinquency rates, and loan underwriting policies. If the Federal Reserve continues to lower the fed funds rate at any of its remaining meetings this year following the 50 basis point drop announced on Sep. 18, personal loan rates could begin to drop further. On Oct. 1, 100% of interest rate traders are betting that the Fed will make its second rate cut of 2024 of at least 25 basis points at its next meeting on Nov. 7, 36% of which are expecting a cut of 50 basis points. Even if the Fed cuts rates, other factors like the delinquency rate on personal loans could offset the lower cost of funds lenders would enjoy after a drop in prime rate, keeping personal loan rates near their current levels. Because most personal loans are fixed-rate products, all that matters for new loans is the rate you lock in at the outset. If you already hold a fixed-rate loan, rate movements will not affect your payments. If you know you will need to take out a personal loan in the coming months, it's likely (but not guaranteed) that rates in the future will be better than what they are now, depending on how lenders react to any Fed rate decreases. Unlike credit card rates, which are typically variable and indexed to the prime rate, fixed-rate personal loans offer the opportunity to know what you will be paying over the loan term. It's wise to shop around for the best personal loan rates in any rate environment. The difference of 1 or 2 percentage points can easily add up to hundreds or even thousands of dollars in interest costs by the end of the loan. Seeking out your best option is time well spent. Lastly, don't forget to consider how you might be able to reduce your spending to avoid taking out a personal loan in the first place or how you could begin building an emergency fund so that future unexpected expenses don't sink your finances and necessitate taking out additional personal loans. Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, and Sept. 15, 2023. Respondents were people who had taken out a personal loan or were planning to soon. We asked how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvements and other large expenditures. Personal loans are provided by financial institutions such as banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Most lenders give rate quotes based on your credit score, the amount you wish to borrow, and the term of the potential loan. Rate quotes generally require a soft credit check that does not impact your credit score and only involves inputting several personal details like name, address, and last four digits of your Social Security number. Once pre-approved for a loan, a more detailed application can be submitted, and the loan is often directly deposited into your checking or savings account as early as the same day. The easiest types of loan to get approved for generally require some kind of collateral, such as car titles or loans against future paychecks. Beware: These types of loans are considered predatory because they carry extremely high interest rates and target those with bad or no credit. The ease of getting a loan for $5,000 depends on the borrower's credit quality, income, loan amount, and loan term. Many lenders offer loans of this size to even those with poor credit quality but usually at higher interest rates compared to borrowers with good or excellent credit scores. According to Investopedia's review of the best personal loans, Sofi was ranked as the best overall personal loan provider in September 2024. Sofi offers low interest rates, charges zero fees, and offers same-day loan funding. While the current average personal loan rate is 25.92%, the rate for any given loan will vary depending on borrower credit and income, loan amount, and loan term. Lenders offering personal loans, such as banks, credit unions, and online financial services providers, advertise available loan rates in a broad range of APRs based on these variable factors. Investopedia collects average quoted personal loan rates, average length of loan, and average loan amount from MoneyLion, comprising 18 of the nation's largest online personal lenders each week, which is used to calculate a four-week average. MoneyLion's loan data is also aggregated by credit quality range (for excellent, good, fair, and bad credit). Investopedia separately collects and displays the advertised APR ranges each month for 70 of the largest personal loan lenders in the country, including online lenders, banks, and credit unions.

Results for how people use personal loans were obtained through a national survey of 962 U.S. adults aged 20 to 75 who are currently borrowing or planning to borrow a personal loan from 70 different lenders. Respondents opted-in to an online, self-administered questionnaire from a market research vendor. Data collection occurred between Aug. 14, 2023, and Sept. 13, 2023, with semi-structured interviews conducted with 17 respondents from Aug. 30, 2023, to Sept. 15, 2023. Multiple quality checks, including screeners, attention gauges, comprehension evaluations, and logic metrics, were used to ensure only the highest quality responses were included.

            "content": "Karon Warren has 20+ years of experience researching and writing about banking, mortgages, credit cards, savings, and other personal finance topics. damircudic/Getty Images Credit card debt consolidation is the process of combining all of your outstanding credit card debt into one payment. By doing so, you could achieve a more manageable monthly payment plus pay less in interest on the total debt.\u00a0Consolidating debt involves basic steps like gathering information on your debts, comparing debt consolidation loan options terms, and taking action. Combining all of your credit card debt into one account could provide several benefits.\u00a0They include: By consolidating your credit card debt, you could obtain a lower interest rate than you pay on your current credit cards. Not only will that save you money, but you could use those savings to pay your debt down faster.\u00a0You could also use some of your savings to create an emergency fund if you don't already have one. By consolidating your credit card debt, you will have just one payment to worry about each month instead of several. That could make it easier to budget and to avoid missing any payments. There are several ways you can consolidate your credit card debt to make it more manageable.\u00a0The major ones are: Many credit card companies offer cards with low or 0% interest rates on balance transfers. Typically the promotional interest rate is for a limited time, so one of these cards can be a great deal if you are able to pay off the balance before the promotion expires. If you choose this option, you likely will be charged a balance transfer fee, which could be a set amount or a percentage of the transferred balance, usually whichever is higher. \"This fee is usually 3% to 5% of the transferred amount,\" says Christopher M. Naghibi, executive vice president and chief operating officer at First Foundation Bank in Irvine, Calif. \"If you're considering a balance transfer credit card, you really owe it to yourself to weigh this cost against the potential interest savings or other benefit to you. Sometimes, it doesn't make sense economically.\" There are other potential drawbacks to these cards, too. For instance, if you don't pay off the balance before the promotional interest rate expires, your rate could increase substantially. Also, if you make late payments, you could lose the promotional interest rate. What's more, if you use the card for new purchases and don't pay them off right away, you will generally have to pay interest on that amount, likely at a higher interest rate than the promotional rate. To apply for a credit card balance transfer, you will need to fill out an application for the card. The credit card company will run a credit check, so if your credit score is not great, you may get denied. Also, when searching for a balance transfer offer, you may need to look at credit cards from lenders other than your existing credit card company. \"You'll likely need to find a balance transfer card from a different bank than where your current debt resides if they don't specifically allow you to do it in their fine print,\" Naghibi says. \"So if JP Morgan Chase offers a balance transfer credit card, you can't transfer your existing Chase Sapphire Preferred card balance to it.\" Depending on your creditworthiness, many credit card issuers will lower the interest rate on your existing balances if you call their customer service departments and let them know you are otherwise considering transferring balances in response to a balance transfer offer from another card issuer. Many lenders, such as banks and credit unions, offer personal loans that can be used for a variety of purposes, including consolidating credit card debt. With such a loan, you could trade in many payments for just one, often at a lower interest rate. However, a personal loan may come with added upfront costs, such as application fees and origination fees. So it's important to review these costs and determine whether the long-term savings would be worth the expense. To apply for a personal loan, you will need to fill out an application and submit to a credit check. You may also be asked to supply bank statements, pay stubs, and tax returns so the lender can evaluate your ability to repay the loan. Home equity loans are backed by the equity you have accumulated in your home. They may offer lower interest rates than other kinds of loans, but they can also have higher fees. \"These loans generally come with origination fees, usually around 2% to 7% of the loan amount,\" says Sean Fox, president of debt resolutions at Achieve, a digital personal finance company in San Mateo, Calif. \"Some lenders charge late fees and/or early repayment fees, so be sure to get all the specifics.\" And because your home serves as collateral for the loan, bear in mind that if you fail to repay it, the lender could foreclose on your home to recoup its funds. You can apply for a home equity loan with lenders including banks, credit unions, and mortgage brokers. You will have to fill out an application and supply any required financial records, such as pay stubs, tax returns, and bank statements. The lender also will run a credit check. A debt consolidation loan is the same as a personal loan except that the money can only be used to pay off other debts. It has the same potential benefits and drawbacks as a personal loan, as well as the same application process. While credit counseling doesn't actually pay off any debt on your behalf, it can be a valuable service to help manage your debt and make it easier to pay off. Credit counseling services are usually available through non-profit organizations such as the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. Counselors can help you set up a budget as well as payment plans or agreements with your creditors. These payment plans are not negotiations to reduce how much you owe; instead, they are agreements wherein the creditors agree to waive late fees or postpone collection efforts for a specific time period. Credit counselors may also help you create a debt management plan, in which you make a single payment to the organization, which then pays your creditors each month. This may or may not incur fees. Before choosing one credit card debt consolidation option over another, it's important to compare all of their fees and other terms. \"Look beyond rates,\" Fox says. \"Every lender will have different rates, as well as ways of working with customers. Sometimes, getting the absolute lowest rate may not be the best answer for someone's particular situation.\" The process for consolidating your credit card debt is basically the same regardless of which option you choose: First, gather the information on your debts (creditor names, account numbers, amounts owed, payment addresses). You then need to do some research on debt consolidation solutions and determine each option's terms and conditions. Shopping around with different credit card companies, online lenders, banks, and credit unions is also important because their terms can vary.\u00a0Bear in mind that your credit score and other individual factors will affect which options you qualify for and the rates you'll pay if you do qualify. Once you have all the information on the options you might qualify for, compare them to determine which one offers the best savings at the lowest cost.\u00a0Consider how much you would save in both the short term and over the long term. Once you narrow down your choice, you can apply for the credit card debt consolidation tool that works best for your situation. Once you consolidate your old credit card debt, it's important to pay down the new debt as efficiently as possible. That means: You could see a small and brief negative impact on your credit score at the outset. That's because any new lenders you apply to will run a hard inquiry on your credit, which can ding your credit score. In addition, if the lender requires you to close your existing credit card accounts, that could also have a negative effect. One of the major factors in your credit score is your credit utilization ratio, which compares how much debt you currently have outstanding to all of the credit you have available to you. The higher that ratio, the better. By paying off your credit cards with a new loan or credit card, but keeping those old accounts open, you can actually improve your credit utilization ratio. Closing the old accounts, however, could hurt it, at least until you've paid down enough of the new debt. If a credit card account remains open after you've paid it off through debt consolidation, you can still use it. However, running up another balance could make it difficult to pay off your debt consolidation account. That depends on your financial situation. It may be simpler just to pay the cards off individually if you have the money to do so readily available. However, if paying off your cards is likely to take a long time, consolidation could most likely save you money and speed the process of becoming debt-free. Debt settlement and debt consolidation are two different things. In debt consolidation you refinance your debt but ultimately pay it off in full. In debt settlement you negotiate with your creditors to see if they will accept a partial payment as payment in full. Debt settlement has a negative impact on your credit and can remain on your credit reports for up to seven years. Many banks do offer loan options to consolidate credit card debt. So you might want to start your search with a bank that you already do business with. When credit card debt becomes overwhelming, consolidating those debts into one account can often provide a manageable, and less costly, way to pay them all off. However, to be successful, it's important to avoid taking on additional debt and to apply your savings to paying down the credit card or loan you're using to consolidate.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. fizkes / GettyImages Debt consolidation loans are typically personal installment loans with fixed interest rates and fixed monthly payments. As with other types of personal loans, debt consolidation loans are offered by many banks, credit unions, personal loan fintech companies, and other kinds of lenders. So, if you're struggling with high-interest debt and hoping to turn your situation around, a debt consolidation loan could be what you need. You'll want to carefully assess your financial situation and review your credit score before researching personal loans. After all, you need to know for sure that you can afford to make the monthly payments and that you have a credit score that's high enough to qualify for a loan with better rates than you're paying now. Consider these factors before you apply for debt consolidation: If you don't know your credit score, you can often obtain it free of charge from your bank or credit card company. There are also online sources for free credit scores. The chart below highlights some of the best debt consolidation loans available today, how much funding they offer, repayment terms, and current interest rates. Applying for a personal loan for debt consolidation is a relatively simple process. Here are the steps involved: If you're on the fence about consolidating debt with a personal loan, there are several other loan options to consider. These include: In addition to other types of credit, there are some additional ways to begin reducing the amounts you owe. They include: Before you take out a debt consolidation loan, you should make sure you're financially prepared to keep up with the monthly payments. Otherwise, you may find yourself in even more debt. Also, compare lenders based on their available loan amounts, repayment terms, interest rates, fees, and other factors. You can improve your chances of getting a debt consolidation loan by working to raise your credit score. You can also boost your approval odds for a loan by adding a co-signer who has good credit, although not all lenders allow that. Origination fees for personal loans are deducted from your loan proceeds upfront, although you still have to repay the full amount of the loan. If you take out a $10,000 loan with an origination fee of 5%, for example, you'll receive $9,500 in funding but have to repay $10,000 plus interest charges. Not all personal loans charge these fees, and you may be able to avoid them if you have a solid credit score. As long as you make your payments on time, a debt consolidation loan won't hurt your credit and may actually help it. The opposite is also true: If you fail to make the loan payments on time, your credit score could take a serious hit. A debt consolidation loan can reduce the amount of interest you're paying on your debts and allow you to pay them off more quickly. The best loans are easy to find online, and most lenders are relatively transparent when it comes to their available loan amounts, fees, interest rates, and eligibility requirements.

            "title": "Employee Loan: What It Is and Should You Get One?",
            "content": "Investopedia / Julie Bang An employee loan is a loan provided by an employer. These types of loans aren't offered by every employer, and they can differ widely in terms of eligibility requirements and other specifics. However, if you need to borrow money and don't qualify for a personal loan or simply want to explore other options, it could be worth asking about an employee loan. If your employer offers employee loans, they might be tailored specifically for your company. However, the process can be similar to that of a traditional personal loan, where you complete a loan application, wait for approval, and, if approved, receive the funds in your bank account.\u00a0Typically, you will repay the loan over time with money deducted from your paycheck. Loan terms and amounts will vary by employer. For instance, Equifax has an employee loan program that offers loans ranging from $1,000 to $35,000, depending on the employee's salary. While employee loans often charge interest, their rates tend to be lower compared to other borrowing options, including personal loans, credit cards, and especially payday loans. The Equifax program, for example, offers annual percentage rates (APRs) of 5.90% to 19.90%. In general, there are two types of employee loans: those that come straight from your employer and ones that are offered through a partnership with a bank or other financial institution as an employee benefit. If you get a loan straight from your employer, it could be in the form of the employer paying upfront for something you need. For instance, your company might cover costs related to buying a home or a car, after which you'd pay the money back to your employer. Otherwise, your employer may refer you to its partner bank, which will evaluate your application and, if you're approved, lend you a lump sum of money. There are a few different types of employee loans. For example, you might be offered one of the following: Unsecured personal loans tend to be offered by employers through a partner lender (unless your employer is a financial institution, in which case it might administer the loans itself). Your employer sets the minimum and maximum amounts, repayment terms, interest rates (if any), and eligibility requirements. For instance, you might be required to work for your employer for a set number of months before becoming eligible. Some employers cover the cost of transportation to and from work as an employee perk. Others will front you the money to pay for transportation-related costs, such as a bus or subway pass, but the cost of this loan may be repaid via deductions from your paycheck. If you frequently need a car for work, your employer might help you pay for the cost of one. This can come in many different forms, depending on your employer. For example, your company might contribute to the down payment for an auto loan, helping lower your monthly payments. It might also pay a portion of your monthly payments based on how much you use the car for work. Like any loans, employee loans have their pros and cons: Low or possibly no interest Could boost credit score Available in small amounts Sometimes strict eligibility requirements Can come with fees and other costs Less take-home pay if money comes out of paycheck First, figure out how much money you need. Then, ask the human resources department or your direct manager if your company offers an employee loan program. If it does, inquire about the eligibility requirements and the application process. If your job doesn't offer employee loans and you need to borrow, you have other options. Rather than going through your employer, you can apply for a personal loan with a bank, credit union, or online lender. These tend to have more stringent eligibility requirements, such as good to excellent credit, to get the lowest interest rates. On the plus side, there isn't a tie to your employer, so if you plan on leaving your job or don't want to have that obligation, an unsecured personal loan might be a good option for you. If you think you won't be eligible for a regular unsecured personal loan or only need a relatively small amount of money, you may want to use a credit card to cover those costs. Already having a credit card gives you the advantage of paying for those needs right now and not waiting for loan approval or being dependent on your credit history for consideration. If you need cash, you might also consider a credit card cash advance. These come with different terms from your credit card purchases, including a different (often much higher) APR and additional fees. However, you can usually get the money right away. If you own a home and have enough equity in it, you may be eligible for a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC). Both home equity financing products tend to have attractive interest rates, but keep in mind that you'll be putting your home up as collateral and could lose it if you're unable to repay. Borrowing from your future self isn't always advisable, but sometimes it's your best option. So, you may want to explore a 401(k) loan or one from another retirement account. These usually don't involve a credit check and repayment terms might be longer compared to what you'd get with other types of loans. Before applying for a personal loan, it's important to understand your monthly debt payments versus your income and budgeting apps can help. Eligibility requirements for employee loans are often more flexible than those on traditional personal loans, but this varies by company. No, not all employers offer employee loans as a benefit to workers, and they are under no legal obligation to do so. Eligibility requirements aren't universal. If your employer does offer employee loans, it's worth making sure you understand the requirements before you go to the trouble of completing a full application. If you are a new employee, for example, you might have to work for a specific amount of time before you become eligible. Your employer sets the interest rate on its employee loans. In general, rates tend to be better than personal loans you could get elsewhere, and some employers charge no interest at all. If you can't repay your employee loan and end up defaulting, a few things could happen. For one, if your employer reports your loan to any of the major credit bureaus, your credit score will drop. That will make it harder to borrow money in the future.\u00a0In addition, you'll most likely do serious damage to your relationship with your employer. Your loan agreement may also give your employer access to your bank account, allowing it to withdraw the money you owe. Employee loans, where offered, can be a convenient and inexpensive way to borrow money when you need it. If your company doesn't already have an employee loan program, consider asking if it could create one.

            "content": "SDI Productions / Getty Images You can get a personal loan when you're receiving disability benefits, provided you have enough income to qualify for the loan amount you want, and you meet other eligibility requirements. For example, having good credit and a long history of paying bills on time can help you qualify for a loan regardless of where your income comes from\u2014provided you can prove it. Applying for a personal loan on disability is straightforward provided you have the statements showing how much you receive in disability benefits and how often. Read on to learn what it takes to get approved for a loan while you're receiving disability benefits, how getting a loan can impact these benefits, and some alternatives to consider. Individuals on disability can apply for personal loans from the same providers as everyone else. The same eligibility requirements will apply, and the same loan amounts and repayment terms are available to everyone. Thanks to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), you cannot be discriminated against based on factors like race, age, gender, or the fact you receive public assistance when applying for a loan. The chart below includes some personal loan lenders that can help you get personal loans with or without a disability. While some of the lenders focus on lending money to people with good or excellent credit, you can also get personal loans with bad credit. These loans tend to come with higher interest rates and more loan fees (including origination fees), and loan amounts tend to be more restricted or on the lower end. And with some personal loans, you can apply with no credit check required. Some examples of lenders that offer personal loans for people on disability with bad credit include: To get a loan on disability, you'll apply for funding just like anyone else. You can get started by gathering information and documents like your Social Security number (SSN), recent pay stubs, W-2s, driver's license or other identification, and utility bills to prove where you live. From there, you'll fill out the loan application with information like your full name, address, phone number, gross monthly income, and monthly mortgage or rent payment. Where the loan application asks for income, you'll list your gross monthly income received through disability along with any other sources of regular income you have. Some personal loan providers also let you choose from several income types, and temporary or permanent benefits (including disability) may be listed as an option. According to the U.S. Social Security Administration, applying for a loan will not impact your disability benefits. If you borrow money and spend it within that month, the loan proceeds will not count as income and will not affect your Supplemental Security Income (SSI). However, if you don't spend all the loan proceeds, that money will count toward your resource limit ($2,000 for an individual, $3,000 for a couple). While with the SSI program, you must have a qualifying disability and meet income limits. The Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) pays benefits if you are \"insured.\" You must have paid enough Social Security taxes on your earnings to qualify, which means having worked long enough. If you are on disability and you need access to cash, there are alternatives to consider outside of personal loans. Here are a few options: You can get a personal loan while on Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), provided you meet the eligibility requirements put in place by your lender. These can include a minimum credit score, a maximum debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, a minimum income, and more. You can also get a loan if you're receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. However, money you borrow and don't spend within the month can count toward your SSI resource limit in future months. You won't be able to list SSDI on a personal loan application until you begin receiving it. As such, your ability to get approved will depend on any other sources of income you have, your credit score, and other factors. You can get a personal loan while on disability if you meet the lender's criteria. For the most part, this means having a good credit score and a reasonable debt-to-income ratio and proving you can repay the amount you want to borrow with your income, including SSDI. Remember to compare lenders carefully before you apply. Some may offer better rates or loan terms that could save you money in the long term.

            "title": "How to Pay Off a Personal Loan Faster",
            "content": "sanjeri / Getty Images You can pay off a personal loan faster, saving you money in interest. Four ways of paying off your personal loan faster include: Paying off debt like small personal loans is generally considered a good financial move, although in some cases, it may be better to use the extra money in other ways. Discover how you can pay off your personal loan faster and how much in total interest you could save. Paying off a personal loan early is a good idea in many situations, but it does have some potential downsides to consider. Paying off a personal loan may not be a good idea if you have higher-interest debt because paying that debt can save you more in total interest. For example, you may want to pay down credit card debt as quickly as you can, as credit cards tend to have high interest rates that can compound and put you in more debt. According to the Federal Reserve, in May of 2024, the average interest rate for a 24-month personal loan was 11.92% versus 21.51% for a credit card. However, if you have a personal loan with a higher interest rate than your other debt, it may be a good idea to pay it down early to help you save money on interest and reduce your debt load. This can improve your credit score and help you free up cash in your budget. Mortgages tend to have lower interest rates, so you may find that paying off a personal loan instead of a mortgage early can result in greater returns. Auto debt and student loan debt also usually come with lower rates than personal loans. However, before you pay off a personal loan early, you should consider the potential financial consequences. For example, you may have to reduce your spending to pay extra toward the principal each month. Make sure extra loan payments will work with your budget. You'll also want to know about any prepayment penalties that can apply and whether your interest savings will offset them. You can take specific steps to pay off a high-interest loan quickly to save money on interest. Here are some strategies: First, you can consider making biweekly payments toward the loan balance instead of monthly payments. This strategy can help you cut months off your loan's repayment term, and you may not feel the impact if you are paid every two weeks. For example, let's say you have a personal loan with a $200 monthly payment, and you decide to make biweekly payments of $100 instead of paying monthly. If you did this, you would wind up paying $2,600 toward the loan over the year (with 26 biweekly payments over 52 weeks) instead of the $2,400 you would pay over 12 months. You can also get out of debt faster by making extra payments, even if said payments are irregular. For example, you can put any gift money you receive toward a personal loan balance throughout the year, or you could make extra payments when you earn more than you expected. If you use an online loan calculator, you can see how changing the payment amount will help you pay off a loan faster and save you money. For example, using Investopedia's online calculator, you can see that if you borrow $5,000 with an interest rate of 10% and a 5-year term, you would owe $106.24 per month for five years and pay a total of $1,374 in interest. If you put an extra $25 per month toward the loan, you could pay it off 1.2 years sooner and save $333 in interest payments. Look for ways to cut spending so you can pay more toward your loan. Reviewing your budget can help you determine where extra cash is going and which expenses are unnecessary. Cutting those from your spending can free up more money for personal loan payments to pay off your loan faster. You can also try a budgeting app to help you develop a strategy for saving and spending that will allow you to put more toward your loan. Some of the best budgeting apps include You Need a Budget (YNAB), PocketGuard, and Empower (formerly Personal Capital). Refinancing your personal loan involves taking out a new loan and using the proceeds to pay off your existing loan. Typically, borrowers go through a bank or credit union to refinance a personal loan to take advantage of a drop in market interest rates. As a result, they would lower their monthly payment and repay the loan by the original payoff date. However, instead of using the refinance to lower your rate and monthly payment, you could maintain the original payment amount. By not reducing the payment, despite the lower rate, more money gets applied towards the principal\u2014or the outstanding loan balance. As a result, you save more in total interest and pay off the loan faster. Sometimes, a refinance can be done to extend the loan term, resulting in a lower monthly payment. However, be aware that you could pay much more in interest over the loan's lifetime. Although personal loan interest rates can fluctuate, rising and falling with overall market rates, you may still have an opportunity to refinance in any market. Even against the backdrop of higher rates, you could potentially still qualify for a lower rate if your income has increased, your debt has decreased, and your credit score has improved. Before refinancing, it's important to calculate how much the lower interest rate will save you over the life of the loan. Let's say you have a $10,000 personal loan with an 11% interest rate and a 60-month repayment term (five years), but you could qualify for a refinance at a lower rate of 7%. Below are the details of how much interest you could save by shortening the loan term and paying it off sooner. By refinancing to a lower rate but forgoing a lower monthly payment, and making a slightly higher payment instead, you could pay off the loan in 48 months versus 60 months. In other words, it would cut a full year from the loan term, and you'd pay nearly half of the total interest. The example above shows a refinance in the first year of the loan to illustrate how much money can be saved by paying it off early when refinancing. In reality, the refinancing would occur at some point during the loan's term after making several payments. As a result, you would save less in interest if you refinance later in the loan's term, but you'd still pay off the loan sooner than you would with the original five-year term and rate. Paying off a personal loan early has significant benefits in interest savings, but there are still some downsides. Get out of debt faster Pay less in interest Reduce financial stress Opportunity cost Possible prepayment penalties Temporary impact on credit score While prepayment penalties on personal loans are relatively rare, some lenders may charge fees for early payoffs. Lenders may charge a flat amount, a specific time period's worth of interest, or a percentage of the remaining loan balance. Paying off a loan can potentially have a small negative effect on your credit score in the short term since it can remove a loan type from your credit mix and could shorten the average length of your credit history. However, loans that are paid off and closed in good standing remain on your credit reports for 10 years, and the benefits of getting out of debt early can be well worth any temporary impact on your credit. You can take out a loan and pay it back immediately, but you can still incur costs. For example, many personal loans charge upfront origination fees that are automatically deducted from the loan proceeds. There are also potential prepayment penalties. You can lower a monthly personal loan payment if you qualify for a lower interest rate or choose a longer repayment term. However, choosing a longer repayment term without a lower interest rate can cost you significantly more interest over time. Making a payment toward a loan more than once per month can help you pay down debt faster and reduce interest payments. However, the best payment frequency for your needs depends on your budget and financial goals. Some advantages and disadvantages come with paying off a personal loan early, yet the pros almost always outweigh the cons. After all, getting out of debt has major upsides outside of interest savings and fewer payments to make each month. Becoming debt-free can make life easier and less stressful and help free up money for other financial goals.

Applying for a personal loan may seem intimidating, but it's fairly straightforward. Let's walk through the key steps for how to apply for a personal loan, as well as actions you can take ahead of time to make the process go more smoothly. When you apply for a personal loan from a lender, you\u2019ll likely go through each of these key steps, which we review in more detail below: Most loan applications take only a few minutes to complete (and funding can arrive the next day\u2014or sooner). But the process before you apply can take a little longer. Consider why you're applying for a personal loan and estimate how much you'll need to borrow. This is a key step in getting a personal loan. You can borrow between $250 and $100,000, so honing in on an appropriate amount will prevent you from borrowing more than you need. (Be aware that lenders may charge an\u00a0origination fee, which is deducted from your loan disbursement. As a result, you may need to borrow a greater amount to cover the fee.) Later in the process, this information can help you narrow your options because permitted loan amounts and interest rates vary by lender. Assess your finances to figure out what you can afford before you apply for the loan. Review your income and expenses to understand your budget or how much money you have coming in and going out each month. Can your budget handle another monthly payment? How much can you comfortably add? Check your credit score, too, because it will play a role in your loan eligibility and interest rate. Higher credit scores improve your odds of approval and allow you to qualify for lower rates. If your credit score is lower than you expected, review your credit report to see whether it includes errors that need to be disputed. Shop around with banks, credit unions, and online lenders to compare loan amounts, interest rates, terms, and fees. Review loan requirements if they're available. For example, some lenders have a minimum credit score, income, or loan amount requirement or only offer loans in certain states. Read personal loan and lender reviews and ratings to help you zero in on the best personal loan lenders, and then rank your top choices. Interest rate is always a key consideration, but many borrowers say they are most satisfied when they work with a lender when they already use their products, such as credit cards, savings accounts, and other types of loans, according to J.D. Power, an industry intelligence research firm. Amid today's high interest rates, customer satisfaction with consumer loans is highest among those with the greatest levels of financial health and is significantly lower among those who are overextended or financially vulnerable. Lenders that ask for an upfront fee or that guarantee approval are often scammers. Most lenders offer pre-qualification that allows you to view the loan terms for which you are likely to be approved. To pre-qualify, you usually only have to enter a minimum amount of information: your personal identifying information, income or employment details, and desired loan amount. The lender will review your information and do a soft credit check, which, unlike a hard inquiry that will occur when you officially apply, won't affect your credit. A soft credit check can give you a preliminary decision, but it doesn't guarantee you'll get approved. With the preparation out of the way and your choice of lender set, you can apply. Many lenders offer online applications, which are quick and convenient. Some lenders, particularly traditional banks, may require you to apply in person. Either way, the loan application will ask for personal and financial information, like your name, home address, and employment information. You may have to provide additional documents, including your: After you submit the application, wait for the results, which may come within minutes or may arrive in a few days. You'll receive a decision faster if your application is complete and free of errors. If you're approved, the next step for how to apply for a personal loan is to review your final loan documents, then accept and sign them. Your loan documents will include the loan amount, interest rate, repayment term, and monthly payment amount. Within a few days of acceptance, you should receive funds in your bank account or by check, depending on the payment method you choose. Loan applications involve a hard credit pull, which can hurt your credit score. If you're shopping around with multiple lenders, your applications will be treated as one credit inquiry if they are made within a 14-day window. That limits damage to your credit score. Investopedia / Jake Shi If you need financing for a large expense but don\u2019t want to use a personal loan, you can consider alternative options. Some of them include: You can generally take out a personal loan for up to $100,000, but several factors affect the amount you can borrow with a personal loan. Maximum amounts vary by lender and your state. Lenders will consider your credit history, ability to pay, and other factors to determine your loan amount. It can take up to several business days to get a personal loan. First, the lender will review and approve your application. You'll have to review and accept the loan agreement. After signing, you could receive your funds the next day, or it may take several business days to receive the money, depending on the lender. Getting a first-time personal loan with no credit history is difficult but possible. Whether you find a lender that will work with you or you wait and build credit, it\u2019s important to monitor your credit report and make on-time payments on your outstanding debt to earn the credit score you need to qualify for favorable loan options in the future. Depending on the lender, you may have a limited time to cancel and return a personal loan with no interest or penalty. Otherwise, if your lender doesn't offer the option to return your loan, you can pay it off immediately, although you may be subject to interest and prepayment penalties. The impact on your credit score after paying off a personal loan depends on the information in your credit history. Your credit score may drop after paying off a personal loan if you don't have any other open installment loans on your credit report because it will affect your credit mix. When preparing to apply for a personal loan, figure out how much money you need and the amount of monthly payments you can afford so you avoid taking out too large a loan. Next, check your credit score and credit report to understand how lenders will view you as a borrower. Research lenders and get pre-qualified to narrow your lender choices. Finally, pull together copies of the required documents to save time when applying to get a personal loan. Many lenders offer online applications, which are quick and convenient.

            "title": "Personal Loans for Health Care Workers: What to Know",
            "content": "These loans offer fixed rates and monthly payments, making them predictable and affordable for many borrowers SDI Productions / GettyImages Health care workers have the same financial needs as anyone else, and that's true whether they are in school or fully established in the workplace. Funds from a personal loan can be used for almost any purpose, such as to pay for school books and supplies, living expenses, moving costs, or furnishings for a new home. Personal loans are also commonly used for debt consolidation, particularly when someone has high-interest credit card debt they want to pay down. There are several reasons personal loans make sense in all of these situations, but the biggest is the fact they come with competitive interest rates and set monthly payments. Personal loans for health care workers, as with any other type of personal loan, typically come with fixed interest rates, a regular monthly payment you agree to ahead of time, and a set repayment term. Health care professionals who are already in the workforce may have a leg up when it comes to qualifying for a personal loan. That's because, in addition to credit requirements, personal loan lenders generally require that applicants have a regular income. The specifics of personal loans vary based on the company offering the loan and the requirements they put in place. For example, some lenders offer minimum loan amounts that start at $1,000 or less, while others might require that you borrow at least $5,000. Maximum loan limits also vary; many lenders cap their loans at $35,000 or $40,000, yet some let you borrow up to $100,000 if you qualify. Repayment terms for personal loans typically run from 24 to 84 months, though some go as long as 144 months. The annual percentage rates (APRs) on personal loans can be anywhere between 5% or so to 35% or more. Some loans also have origination fees that are deducted from the loan amount upfront. Finally, it's worth noting that the vast majority of personal loans are unsecured, with no requirement for collateral. However, secured personal loans that do require collateral (such as a car title, money in a savings account, certificate of deposit (CD), etc.) also exist. Health care workers can use personal loans for nearly any reason. However, there are some scenarios where these loans are particularly popular, including: Many lenders will not approve personal loans that will be used to pay college tuition and fees. Some lenders also prohibit using personal loans to pay off student loan debt. Health care workers can get personal loans from banks, credit unions, peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders, and online lenders. It's possible to obtain a personal loan through a brick-and-mortar financial institution you already have a relationship with or through one that operates branches but also has an online presence. Generally speaking, however, you'll find many of the best personal loans online. That's because, by and large, online lenders without a physical location have lower overhead and can offer lower interest rates and fees as a result. Health care workers face the same approval requirements for personal loans as anyone else, although these requirements do vary from lender to lender. Here are some of the things a lender will typically consider: You can apply for a personal loan on your own if you feel you can meet the eligibility requirements. Some lenders also allow joint applications or personal loans with a cosigner. Whichever route you choose, here are the basic steps: If you are approved for a personal loan, most lenders will transfer the money to your bank account within a few business days. Like any other way of borrowing money, personal loans have their pros and cons: Get a lump sum of cash upfront Lock in a fixed interest rate and monthly payment Know exactly when you will be done paying Approval and funding is usually fast Typically lower interest rates than credit cards Helps build credit Eligibility requirements can be strict Some personal loans have origination fees You'll be taking on more debt Credit score damage if you pay late  As mentioned, personal loans are offered by a broad range of lenders. Here are some that are likely to work well for borrowers who need a lump sum of cash and will be able to pay it off over 24 to 84 months. Credit score minimums for personal loans vary widely. Where some lenders require minimum credit scores of 580, 670, or higher, others will accept a score of 300, the lowest possible. You can typically borrow between $1,000 and $100,000, although minimum and maximum loan amounts will vary from lender to lender and according to each lender's assessment of your creditworthiness. If you are not currently working, with a verifiable income, obtaining a personal loan might be difficult. However, if you have a family member or trusted friend with a regular income and a solid credit score, you could consider asking them to apply with you as a co-signer. The American Nurses Foundation has a grant program that has provided $3 million in funding to nurses who have suffered financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. You can learn how to apply and fill out an application for assistance here. Personal loans be a lifesaver in financial emergencies, but they can also be used for many other purposes. For example, it often makes sense to use a personal loan for debt consolidation since rates tend to be much lower than those on most credit cards. If you do take out a personal loan, it's best to borrow no more than you absolutely need and to make sure you keep up with the payments so you don't damage your credit score for the next time you need to borrow.

            "title": "Funeral Loans for Bad Credit: What to Know",
            "content": "Funeral loans, or personal loans to cover funeral expenses, are available for those who need them damircudic / GettyImages Losing a loved one can be a difficult experience on a number of levels, including financially, with the average cost of a funeral, including a viewing and burial, currently exceeding $7,800. What can you do if you need to arrange a funeral but don't have the money available? You have several options, including taking out a personal loan. You can still get a personal loan even if you have bad credit, but you'll likely pay more than you would with a higher score. Here's what you need to know. Under federal law, a funeral home must provide you with a list of potential costs in writing before you commit to them. You can also request prices over the phone. With certain exceptions, you have the right to choose only the services you want. While prices and services can vary depending on the funeral home you choose and where you live, these were some of the average costs in 2021, according to the National Funeral Directors Association: As you can see, depending on which services you choose and how involved the funeral is, it can become quite expensive. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers a checklist you can use to keep track of costs and see how they add up. It's possible to get a personal loan for funeral expenses\u2014including loans if you have bad credit. Note, however, that these loans come with costs, as any personal loan would. With a personal loan, you can pay for the funeral upfront, but you'll be committing to making payments for months or years into the future until the debt is paid off. Funeral loans, as they are sometimes called, can be used to cover the cost of the service, preparation of the body, burial or cremation, the casket or urn, and related expenses. As with most other personal loans, you're likely to get a better deal if you have a good credit score. While you can obtain a funeral loan with bad credit, you might need to pay a higher interest rate or accept a loan with a higher origination fee. Provides funding to pay for the funeral upfront You'll usually receive the money quickly, which is often necessary when planning a funeral Can reduce the stress of coming up with the money during an already stressful time Interest rates can be high if you have poor credit Loan terms can be short, possibly making repayment difficult If you are unable to keep up with the payments, you'll do further damage to your credit While some funeral homes offer payment plans, allowing you to pay them over time, that's not always a possibility. If you don't have enough cash available, a personal loan can be one way to cover the entire cost upfront. On top of that, personal loans often offer fast funding. You might be able to get the money quickly, sometimes the same day you apply. This ensures that you can hold the funeral in a timely fashion. Finally, in some cases, it can actually be helpful to use a funeral loan if you have poor credit. So long as you make payments on time and in full, a funeral loan can help boost your credit score. While there are good reasons to take out a personal loan for funeral costs, there are also some downsides. First of all, you're getting into debt. If you have bad credit, you might qualify for a loan, but you'll likely pay a higher interest rate and possibly a high origination fee. This can mean extra costs on top of those associated with a funeral. In addition, you might have to agree to a short repayment term, requiring you to pay off the loan relatively quickly and straining your financial resources in the meantime. And, of course, if you can't make your payments, it could have a serious impact on your credit score and your ability to borrow for other purposes in the future. Getting a personal loan for funeral expenses is similar to getting other types of personal loans. Here are some of the steps you'll want to take: It can be difficult to focus on financial matters during this challenging time, but doing so can help you avoid mistakes you'll later regret. A funeral loan isn't the only option available when you need to cover the costs associated with honoring a loved one. Here are some alternative ways to pay for a funeral. Depending on the situation, a funeral director might be able to help you with a payment plan to break up the total cost and make it more manageable. You can also work with the funeral director to find lower-cost options for the funeral and its related services. If your loved one was covered by life insurance, the death benefit might be enough to pay the cost of the funeral. In some cases, the deceased might even have funeral or burial insurance, which is designed to cover those costs. If you have an emergency fund, you might be able to use it to cover funeral expenses. But try not to drain the fund to the point where you'd be in a difficult situation should you face an immediate emergency. Don't forget that you might be able to use crowdfunding to raise money to help cover the costs of a funeral. Additionally, some funeral homes will help you set up a memorial fund that can help you pay for the funeral. With these options, friends and family can contribute. This can be a way to defray the funeral costs while giving other loved ones in the deceased's network a way to show their respect and honor the family. Some local and state governments offer help for funeral costs. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs also provides burial benefits to eligible current and former service members and their families. Additionally, until 2025, the federal government is offering up to $9,000 to help pay for funeral expenses associated with COVID-19. If you meet the requirements and can show that the death was related to COVID-19, you might be able to tap into those funds. Another option, if you have enough available credit on a credit card, is to use it to pay for the funeral. This is still a type of debt, of course, but it might be a fast way to cover the cost. If you earn cash back or other rewards, using a credit card might also make sense. If you decide to use a credit card, though, it's important to consider the cost. In many cases, a credit card's interest rate will substantially higher than the rate for a personal loan. If you can get a 0% promotional annual percentage rate (APR) on a new credit card, however, you might be able to save money. But make sure you can pay off the debt before the promotional period ends and a higher interest rate kicks in. There are other loan products available for expenses like funerals. But be careful. Payday loans, for example, often have exorbitant APRs, potentially trapping you in a cycle of debt long after the funeral has passed. A home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC) can be another option if you own a home. While it will likely come with a reasonable interest rate, bear in mind that you'll be putting your home up as collateral and could risk losing it if you're unable to make payments. There's no universally required credit score for a funeral loan. Instead, lenders set their own criteria. You're more likely to get better terms if you have a higher credit score. However, some lenders offer loans for those with bad credit. Whether you can use a credit card at a funeral home depends on that business' policies. If you do use a credit card, make a plan to pay it off as quickly as possible. Depending on the situation, there might be some government funds available to help cover costs. If not, you can consider other ways to cut back, such as eliminating the viewing or choosing cremation instead of burial. Funerals can be expensive, and survivors are often unprepared for the cost. If you decide to use a personal loan to cover funeral expenses, carefully consider your loan options and see if there are other steps you can take to reduce your need to take on debt.

            "title": "How to Compare Personal Loans From Different Lenders",
            "content": "Check these key features to find the best loan and lender for you pixdeluxe / Getty Images When you're shopping for a personal loan, the most important factors to consider include the annual percentage rate (APR), any potential fees, the loan term or length, and whether the lender requires a certain minimum credit score. Let's take a deeper dive into what to look for as you compare personal loans\u2014and review some of the best providers of them. Personal loans can vary heavily from one lender to another, and any given lender may offer a variety of loan products with different rates and other provisions. Here are the key things to focus on during your search. One of the most important features to consider when comparing personal loans is the annual percentage rate, or APR. This is the interest rate you'll pay, including any applicable fees. The higher the APR, the greater the overall cost of the loan. Many personal loans come with fixed interest rates, but some have rates that can change over time. With a variable rate, there's a chance that your interest rate could shoot higher before your loan is paid off. If you want stability in your budget, nail down a fixed rate. If you're more interested in getting a lower initial rate or think interest rates will fall, a variable rate can make sense\u2014but remember the risks. Look at how long the repayment term is. It's common to see personal loans with repayment periods of between two and five years. However, some lenders may offer longer repayment terms, such as up to seven or 10 years. A longer repayment term might mean a lower monthly payment, but you could end up spending more overall due to the length of time you'll be paying interest. Conversely, a shorter repayment term might come with a higher monthly obligation, but you could be out of debt sooner\u2014and save money in interest. Balance your needs and consider your budget so you can choose a repayment term that works for you. Some banks and other lenders will let you borrow as little as $500 or $1,000, while others may require that you borrow at least $2,000\u2014or even $5,000. If you only need a small amount, borrowing more than that can be needlessly expensive in terms of interest. On the other hand, if you need considerably more money, look for a lender that can accommodate you. Sometimes it's less about what you prefer and more about the lender's criteria. For example, some lenders only offer loans to people with credit scores of at least 660. Other lenders might allow you to borrow even if your credit score is below 500. However, to get the best rates, you will likely need a credit score of at least 670 or higher. Not every lender lists their minimum score, so calling or emailing to find out before you apply can be a time saver. If you don't already know your credit score, it's available free of charge from many banks, credit card companies, and free online sources. Ask how long it takes to receive a decision on your application and when you'll receive your funds if you're approved. If you need money fast, look for a lender that can provide a decision in a few minutes (as many online lenders can) and can deposit your money as soon as the following business day. The faster you need the money, the more you'll need to narrow down your choices. Be sure to review all the fees you might have to pay. This includes origination fees as well as prepayment penalties, late fees, and returned payment fees, among others. Some lenders won't charge these types of fees, which can make their loans more attractive. Additionally, if you have good credit, you might be able to work with lenders that don't charge origination fees. If you're concerned that your credit score or income is going to make it difficult for you to qualify for a regular personal loan, it might make sense to look for a lender that will allow you to put up collateral. A personal loan backed by collateral is referred to as a secured loan. Certain other features can make a loan more attractive. For example, you might look for a lender that offers a rate discount for autopay or some other action on your part. An extra-long repayment term might also make sense if your loan purpose requires a large amount, or you might want a lender that doesn't charge prepayment penalties. Lenders that offer the opportunity to use a co-borrower or co-signer might also be a good option if you expect to have a hard time getting a loan by yourself. Before you apply for a personal loan, it's a wise idea to get your finances in order and have a clear understanding of where you stand. Here are some things to do before you take the step to apply for a personal loan: If you aren't in a rush to get a personal loan, taking steps to raise your credit score before you apply can be a smart move. When comparing different loans from different lenders, you'll want to look at several key factors. The best loan for you will offer the right combination of them. This chart shows some of the best recent offers from major lenders. Investopedia also publishes a regularly updated list of the best personal loans available. *SoFi members have the option of either getting a loan without an origination fee or paying a one-time fee for a lower interest rate. In many cases, personal lenders require you to provide bank account information so they can directly deposit the money in your account (and automatically deduct payments). However, some lenders might agree to send you a check if you prefer. When you take out a personal loan, you run the risk of being unable to repay it. If you can't repay the loan, your credit score could be severely damaged. Additionally, there's a chance that a lender could send your account to collections and you could be sued, resulting in a judgment against you that might lead to wage garnishment or other negative outcomes. When you're turned down for a personal loan, the reasons why the lender made its decision should be provided to you. You can use this information to improve your chances of getting approved later. In general, you can use a personal loan for many things. It's common to use personal loans for medical bills, car repairs, financial emergencies, and life events, such as a wedding. Most lenders do ask your reason for the loan; personal loans aren't intended for paying school tuition or for a down payment for a house, and if you state this as the reason, you may be denied. When you compare personal loans, start by considering your needs and financial situation. Figure out how much you need to borrow, how much time you might need to repay the loan, and how much you can afford to pay each month. Once you clearly understand your situation, you can begin comparing loans to find the best possible deal for your circumstances.

            "content": "A \"divorce loan\" can help cover a wide variety of expenses Eric Audras / GettyImages The end of a marriage can be challenging, and there are consequences that extend far beyond the emotional distress, many of them financial. A study by the legal website Nolo.com found that the average cost of a do-it-yourself divorce without a lawyer was $925. When lawyers got involved, the average jumped from $4,100 for an uncontested divorce to over $20,000 for a divorce that went to trial. When someone doesn't have the funds to pay legal fees and other expenses, it's often possible to take out a personal loan to cover them. Divorce loans can be used for many of the costs associated with a divorce, allowing the borrower to repay the money over the next two to seven years. Here's how these loans work. A divorce loan is an informal name for a personal loan that's used to pay for a divorce. These loans are ideal for divorce expenses since they're typically unsecured (i.e., they have no collateral requirement) and since they provide a lump sum of cash that the borrower can spend however they wish. Personal loans for divorce also come with fixed interest rates and set monthly payments, which means you can borrow what you need, and you'll know exactly how much you'll owe and for how long. Generally speaking, divorce loans are available in amounts ranging from $1,000 to $100,000, depending on the lender. Typical repayment terms are from 24 to 84 months, although this also varies. The best personal loans for divorce will typically be available to individuals with good to excellent credit or FICO scores of 670 and up. For borrowers with lower scores, interest rates can be on the high side. Additionally, such borrowers are more likely to have to pay origination fees, which will be subtracted from the initial loan amount. The cheapest way to get a divorce is if both parties can agree on all the major terms. In that scenario, a divorce can cost less than $500, plus filing fees that vary by state, according to LegalZoom. A personal loan can cover any and all costs associated with a divorce, in addition to related expenses that pop up during and after the proceedings. Here's a rundown of some of the potential expenses you could use a divorce loan for: Most of the time, each party in a divorce pays their own legal fees. However, the petitioner (the person requesting the divorce) typically pays for court fees and similar charges. While you're unlikely to find many lenders specifically advertising divorce loans, you can apply for this type of loan with any bank or other financial institution that offers personal loans. Many of the best personal loans are offered by online lenders, which makes it easy to compare options and look for the best rates before you apply. In shopping for a loan, you'll want to compare available loan amounts, annual percentage rates (APRs), the length of their repayment terms, and any loan fees. Using a loan calculator can help you figure out what your monthly payment would be based on your APR, repayment term, and how much you borrow. Before you apply, it's a good idea to gather the necessary documentation, such as pay stubs, W-2 forms, proof of address, and possibly recent tax returns. Plan on sharing information like your full name, date of birth, Social Security number (SSN), employment status, monthly housing payment, income, and more on the loan application. It can provide the money you need to put your divorce behind you You can use the funds to cover related expenses for moving, new housing, and more You can lock in a fixed interest rate and monthly payment Personal loans have lower rates than credit cards  Repayment can take years You must meet loan eligibility requirements Any missed payments can hurt your credit score Loans for divorce can be expensive if you have poor credit There are other ways to pay for a divorce, and you may want to consider them in place of, or in addition to, taking out a divorce loan. Here are a few options to consider: According to Nolo.com, the average hourly fee charged by divorce lawyers in 2019 was $270. But costs can vary widely depending on the part of the country and the lawyer's level of experience. The waiting period before a divorce is final varies by state. Some have no waiting period, while others require a wait of up to 365 days (a full year). The person responsible for post-divorce debt depends on whether the debt was incurred separately and how any debt incurred while the couple was together is divided during divorce proceedings. Ultimately, this will vary from case to case. No, the legal fees for a divorce are considered a personal legal expense by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and aren't tax-deductible. Divorce itself has no direct impact on credit scores, although the financial issues that may arise from divorce can. For example, missing payments on bills can lead to credit score damage, as can having a higher credit utilization ratio due to post-divorce debt. Taking out a personal loan for divorce can make sense if you need cash now and you expect to have the income to pay it back later on. Just remember to compare lenders side-by-side to find the lowest rates and best loan terms. Also, make sure you only borrow what you need, and keep in mind that your credit score and finances can improve as you pay it off.

            "title": "Need a $200k Personal Loan? Here's How to Borrow a Lot of Money",
            "content": "Shapecharge / Getty images Lenders have different minimum and maximum amounts for borrowing a personal loan. Personal loans for $200,000 are very rare. If you find a lender that offers a six-figure personal loan, it\u2019s usually capped at $100,000. In most cases, lenders cap the amount you can borrow with one personal loan at $40,000 or $50,000. However, there are ways you can potentially get a loan for $200,000 using other loan products. Learn more about your options for borrowing large amounts of money. While you could get a $200,000 mortgage or refinance loan, you will not likely find a personal loan for that amount. Unlike home loans, personal loans are typically unsecured, meaning they are not backed by collateral. Unsecured loans are a higher risk for lenders, so they're typically not willing to lend as much as they would for a secured loan. In general, the more money you want to borrow, the better your creditworthiness needs to be. You'll need a strong credit score and sufficient income. Here are the main steps you need to take to get a large personal loan. The higher your credit score, the more likely lenders are to approve you for the loan amount you request (up to their maximum limit). Excellent credit tells lenders you\u2019re responsible with credit and less likely to default on a loan. Compare lenders based on factors like the maximum loan amount they offer, repayment terms, interest rates, and any fees they may charge.\u00a0If you need a $200,000 loan, make sure you can afford to make the monthly payments. Loans with lower interest rates and longer repayment terms mean lower monthly payments. You can compare loans from different lenders through pre-qualification. This requires a soft credit check and doesn\u2019t hurt your credit score. Once you\u2019ve gotten pre-qualified with a lender whose loans meet your needs, prepare the documents you'll need to complete a full application. These can include a copy of your driver\u2019s license or other government-issued identification, your Social Security number (SSN), proof of address, and employment verification, among other paperwork. You\u2019ll also likely need key financial documents, such as bank statements, tax returns, W-2s, and pay stubs, to verify your income and that you have the means to repay your loan. Most personal loan lenders let you apply online, and you\u2019ll know right away if you\u2019re approved. After you apply and get approved, you can accept loan terms and set up banking information. Every disbursement time is different, depending on the lender, but in most cases, you'll typically receive your funds in as little as a day or up to a week. Not all personal loan lenders offer large loans, but there are a couple that do, such as: If you don\u2019t have great credit, you might have difficulty qualifying for a personal loan or getting the full amount you need. However, there are some ways you can get a large personal loan even with bad credit. If you have a low or average credit score, taking time to improve your credit can increase your chances of getting approved for a loan. Try to pay off debt and make sure you make all payments on time to creditors. If you see errors on your credit report, call your creditors to get them to correct the error with the credit bureaus. You can check your credit report for free each year through AnnualCreditReport.com. You can also consider getting a secured personal loan. These loans use assets like your savings account to back the loan. Because the collateral reduces the lender's risk, you may be able to get a secured loan if you can\u2019t qualify for an unsecured loan. If you don\u2019t qualify for a large loan on your own, consider getting a co-signer on the loan. A lender will also look at your co-signer's credit and financial situation when it decides whether to approve you for a loan. A co-signer signs onto your loan and is responsible for making payments if you fail to do so, which also reduces the risk for the lender. A co-signer can be helpful if you need a personal loan immediately and don\u2019t have the time or resources to build up your credit in the short term. If you don\u2019t qualify for a large personal loan or you want to explore your options, you have a few alternatives to consider, including several different personal loans, credit cards, and home equity loans. If you have decent credit and can find lenders to borrow from, you can apply for several different personal loans to get the full $200,000 you need. While there\u2019s no limit to how many personal loans you can have at once from multiple lenders, some lenders might limit how many personal loans you can have with them. Along with that, the more hard inquiries listed on your credit report, which are added when you complete a loan application, the more your credit score drops. Most credit cards have limits based on how much you earn and if you can responsibly repay your minimum balance every month. However, some credit cards have high credit limits, and if you qualify, you can use those cards to pay for your needs. Just keep in mind that credit cards often have higher interest rates than personal loans. If you own your home and have built up equity, you may be able to borrow against the equity for a larger amount than you can get with a personal loan. A home equity loan is a type of lump-sum loan often referred to as a second mortgage, as you may be making payments on your regular mortgage as well as a home equity loan at the same time when repayment begins. A home equity line of credit (HELOC) also uses your equity to back the loan, but with this loan, you only take out what you need. After you repay the funds you use from a HELOC, you can reuse the funds again, just as you would with a credit card. Interest rates on home equity loans and HELOCs tend to be lower than personal loans because you use your home as collateral. This reduces the risk for the mortgage lender, as they can recoup lost funds should you fail to repay the loan by selling your home. With home equity loans and HELOCs, you risk losing your home to foreclosure if you fail to make payments. Most personal loans cap the amount you can get to around $40,000 or $50,000. In a couple of cases, you can borrow up to $100,000. However, only a few lenders offer this, and it\u2019s normally reserved for borrowers with excellent credit. Since you likely can\u2019t get a $200,000 loan from one lender, you\u2019ll need to take out multiple loans from a few different lenders to get this amount. The higher your credit score, the more likely you can qualify for the amount you need with the lowest interest rates offered. If you don\u2019t have excellent credit, consider applying with a co-signer who has excellent credit to secure the highest amount offered. There\u2019s no universal limit to how many personal loans you can have at once, so long as they are with different lenders. Some lenders limit how many personal loans you can have at once with them. A good personal loan interest rate is the lowest interest rate offered among the lenders you're considering. Interest rates are always fluctuating, so it\u2019s important to see what offers are available before completing a loan application. Large personal loans aren\u2019t common, but a few lenders offer them, some for as high as $100,000. While you likely won\u2019t find lenders offering $200,000 personal loans, you can still find ways to fund major expenses with other loan solutions. Consider borrowing from multiple lenders, using credit cards, or tapping into your home's equity through a loan or line of credit if you have the means. Try to improve your credit report by paying down debt and making timely payments before applying for a large personal loan.

            "content": "Though scammers may tell you otherwise, it is illegal to use a CPN in place of your SSN to hide your credit history Skynesher / Getty Images Having bad credit can hold you back from many financial opportunities, such as taking out a personal loan, but you can take steps to improve it. You might consider getting a credit privacy number or CPN, which is an option offered by disreputable credit repair companies. However, using a CPN can have serious legal consequences, so it's important to only work with legitimate credit repair companies. A CPN is a nine-digit number that\u2019s crafted to look like a Social Security number (SSN). Fraudulent credit repair companies might try to trick you into buying a CPN as an alternative to putting your own SSN into a personal loan application. However, a CPN is most likely a stolen SSN, which means you could be committing fraud when you use it. A good credit repair company will not offer you a CPN. If you\u2019re trying to repair your credit score and history, a company might try to sell you a CPN to use on credit applications. The idea is that a CPN hides your bad credit score or any bankruptcies on your credit report from potential lenders or credit issuers. However, CPNs are able to do this because they're actually SSNs that belong to other people, often those stolen from children, prison inmates, or senior citizens. If you have a bad credit history, you might be tempted to use a CPN. However, taking these shortcuts will only hurt you more in the long run. CPNs are visually similar to SSNs and Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) in that they're nine numbers with dashes between them at specific intervals. Unless you're facing special circumstances, such as being the victim of identity theft, you\u2019ll have the same SSN for your entire life. And while SSNs and ITINs are government-issued and legitimate, CPNs come from predatory companies that are marketing a product they\u2019re promising will help you when it will just make you party to identity theft. Even if you get a new SSN, your name and financial history are still tied to the old one. You\u2019ll have that old SSN on file because it has a role in Social Security payments (when you\u2019re eligible) and other important documents. While you technically can use a CPN to secure a personal loan without providing your own Social Security number or ITIN, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s legal. Typically, the CPN you're given is someone else\u2019s Social Security number. If discovered, you could be arrested and charged with identity theft or fraud. Fixing your credit is a long-term process. There are rarely quick fixes to bad credit. If someone is trying to sell you something that seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look for signs of credit repair scams, which may include: There are many reputable services that can help you repair and build up your credit the right way. If you need help, you can search through this government-approved list of credit counselors to find one. Rebuilding credit takes time, but there are a few things you can do right now to start improving your credit: Legitimate lenders may charge loan origination fees for processing your credit application and reviewing your credit history to determine whether to approve you for a loan. However, be aware of advance-fee loan scams from companies that offer guaranteed approval even if you have a low income or a poor credit history. These companies scam you by charging an upfront fee, but they cannot approve loans. A CPN could potentially be someone's Social Security number. If you use one, you could be committing identity theft and fraud. There\u2019s a chance you could be arrested and serve time in prison for identity theft. Using a credit privacy number (CPN) could get you in legal trouble. Using one to hide your own bad credit history would likely mean you\u2019re committing fraud. Selling a CPN is also illegal. There are legitimate credit repair companies, but there are some that prey on those desperate for quick fixes for their poor credit history and scores. If you need help boosting your credit score, contact nonprofit credit counselors. Many offer services for free or charge an affordable fee. A CPN comes from a disreputable credit repair company that requires upfront payment for a fraudulent number. These are usually SSNs belonging to someone else, meaning if you use one, you could be committing fraud, whether you intended to or not. Avoid using a CPN and start rebuilding your credit the right way. Check your credit reports for free and report any errors you find. Make on-time monthly payments on your extant debt, and work to lower your credit utilization rate. When you\u2019re ready to get a new loan or line of credit like a credit card, ensure it fits into your budget and that you can afford the monthly payments.

            "title": "How Extra Payments Affect Future Personal Loan Payments",
            "content": "Making small extra monthly payments can lower your total interest Kali9 / Getty Images Making extra payments toward a personal loan, whether monthly or whenever you can, helps you save money in interest and pay off the loan faster. When you make extra payments, you reduce the loan's principal\u2014or the outstanding balance. Paying extra can also lower your future monthly payment amount if you have a variable payment schedule like a line of credit. However, be aware of lenders charging prepayment penalties for repaying a loan earlier. Discover how extra payments can affect your future loan payments and financial outlook. One of the biggest advantages of making extra payments on your personal loan is that you can save money. When your extra payments reduce your principal, you also reduce the amount of total interest you're charged (based on the principal). In addition, extra payments shorten the length of time you're in debt. If you want to get out of debt faster, extra payments can reduce the time it takes to pay down the debt. When you have your loan paid off, you can put the money you were using to make extra payments toward paying down other debt or other financial goals like saving for retirement. You can use a personal loan calculator to determine potential savings and to compare different extra payment amounts. If you have a student loan, you have the right to make extra payments on it without being charged a fee or prepayment penalty. When considering whether to put extra money toward paying down your personal loan early, consider the possible downsides. Check whether your lender charges a prepayment penalty if you pay off the loan sooner than the original loan term. Some lenders charge a fee when you don't keep the loan until the end of the term. Then, use a loan calculator to check whether the amount you would save in interest by making extra payments would offset the prepayment penalty. You might find that it's worth paying the penalty to be out of debt sooner, especially if you would still have interest savings left afterward. Another consideration is how long a personal loan stays on your credit if you make extra payments. Monthly payments are reported to credit bureaus, which can help your credit score. Additionally, keeping the loan can contribute to a longer credit history. In fact, in some cases, your credit score might drop after you pay off a loan. However, generally paying down your debt is more beneficial to your credit history than paying a loan reliably for a few months longer. Finally, think about how the extra payments might impact your personal finances. If putting extra money toward a loan means you cannot pay other bills, this strategy can do more harm than good. Or, you could put the extra money toward an investment that could earn you more than you would save in interest by making additional payments. You could also use extra money to build an emergency fund, which can ensure you can afford an unexpected major expense, such as a hospital bill or car repair bill. Pay less interest Get out of debt faster More money for long-term goals like retirement Prepayment penalty Reduces length of credit history Less money towards savings like an emergency fund Carefully consider your financial situation, and be sure you can handle the extra payments without straining your budget. If you want to pay off your personal loan early, you can take specific steps to make the debt repayment more manageable. These include: Using a personal loan calculator can help you get a sense of how much you could save over the life of the loan\u2014and how quickly you can pay it off\u2014by making extra payments. For example, let's say you have a $10,000 loan with a term of seven years at a 15% interest rate. Your monthly payment would be $192.97. The total interest you'd pay on that loan would be $6,209.27. If you want to pay off the loan faster, you could put an extra $100 toward the loan each month. With this plan, you could be out of debt in a little less than four years and save more than $3,000 in interest. With these extra payments, you'd be saving money in interest and be out of debt faster. When you make an extra payment on a loan, it's usually applied to the principal balance, repaying the original amount you borrowed. Paying down the principal reduces the amount of interest you pay since your monthly payment consists of a portion towards the principal and interest on the outstanding balance. Yes, you can make extra payments on a personal loan. Contact your lender to determine how extra payments are handled to ensure the funds get applied towards the principal. Be sure to ask if your lender charges a prepayment penalty for paying off your loan early. Whether paying extra towards a personal loan makes sense depends on your financial situation and the amount of interest saved. Making extra payments on a personal loan gets you out of debt faster, reduces the amount of interest you pay, and can improve your finances. However, it's important to balance paying off your personal loan faster with your other financial goals, such as building an emergency fund or saving for retirement. You'll also want to ensure prepayment penalties do not offset the interest savings. A personal loan results in interest payments and can cost you more money over time. Paying down your debt faster can save you hundreds of dollars in interest while reducing your time in debt. However, before you devote a large portion of your budget toward making extra payments, make sure you have sufficient financial resources and a plan for reaching your other financial goals.

            "title": "Why Would a Personal Loan Be Declined?",
            "content": "Learn key steps to improve your chances of a loan approval Damircudic / Getty Images When you apply for a personal loan, there's a chance that you might be declined. Five of the most common reasons that might prevent you from getting approved for a personal loan include: If you get denied when applying for credit, look for ways to increase your chances of approval by boosting your credit score, getting a co-signer, or providing collateral. When a lender declines your personal loan application based on information from a consumer credit report, they must tell you why. Understanding the cause of your application being declined can help you change your behaviors and improve your chances of securing a loan in the future. Your credit score is often used to make decisions about loans because it's considered a measure of the likelihood that you'll repay a debt. Your credit score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and ability to repay your debts. Your credit score is calculated based on the information in your credit report. If you have a poor credit score, a lender might decide providing you with a loan is too big of a risk. They may assume you won't repay the loan, or your missed payments might result in the need to attempt to collect from you. Another consideration is whether or not you have a lot of debt relative to your income. When determining your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, lenders consider your monthly income compared to the total amount of your monthly debt payments. For example, let's say that you earn $4,000 per month in gross income\u2014or your income before taxes and deductions are taken out of your paycheck. You have the following monthly payments: To calculate your debt-to-income ratio, total your monthly debt payments and divide the result by your gross monthly income as follows: In other words, 44% of your monthly income goes toward your debt. We multiplied the result in the DTI calculation of .44 by 100 to convert the decimal into a percentage. Lenders typically prefer a DTI of 35% to 40% or lower for personal loan applications. So, while lenders can always make exceptions to this general rule, there's a chance that a high DTI could lead to being declined for a personal loan, even if you have good credit. Another concern is that you might not have enough money to repay the loan. The lender might look at the amount of your loan and potential monthly payments, and they may decide that your income isn't high enough to handle it. Even if you don't have a high debt-to-income ratio (DTI), low income can cause concerns about your ability to handle loan payments and impact your odds of getting approved for a loan. Because personal loan lenders are interested in receiving steady loan payments, they are also interested in ensuring your income is relatively stable. If you have an unstable employment history or have been unemployed for an extended period, a lender might be reluctant to approve you for a loan. After reviewing your pay stubs and tax returns, a lender might decide your income isn't consistent enough for you to make regular payments. Every lender has its own criteria for providing funds for loans. Some basic requirements that lenders may have include: There might be other requirements, such as being employed or providing proof of assets. If you don't meet those basic requirements, your personal loan might be declined. Before applying for a personal loan, make sure you understand the lender's requirements. If you receive notice that your personal loan application was declined, there are some steps you can take to learn more about the situation and potentially find better success: Backing up your application with extra tax returns, additional proof of income or assets, and other paperwork might show that you're capable of repaying the loan. Even if you don't get a personal loan this time, you might be able to improve the odds that you'll get a personal loan in the future. Here are some steps you can take to boost your chances of securing a personal loan: Legitimate lenders can charge a loan origination fee for reviewing your credit application and credit history. However, be aware of advance-fee loan scams from companies that promise you guaranteed approval no matter your income or credit history, but you must pay an upfront fee. In many cases, it makes sense to wait at least 30 days before applying again. This gives you time to address the reason your personal loan was declined. You may want to wait even longer if you have major financial improvements to make to qualify for the loan. You can expect a hard inquiry to remain on your credit report for two years, although the impact on your score will be minimal from one loan application. If the lender only performed a soft inquiry, your credit score won't be affected. Even if you have good credit, other factors, such as your debt-to-income ratio and income, might be impacting your ability to get a loan. If your total debt payments are already high, a lender may find it risky to provide you with even more debt. Similarly, if your income is too low, the lender may feel you are at a higher risk of not repaying a loan. There is no widely accepted minimum credit score since each lender has its own criteria for personal loans. Typically, you need a credit score in the 600s to get approved. However, some lenders approve loans for borrowers with lower scores, but the interest rate might be very high. Although there are various reasons for getting denied when applying for a personal loan, five of those reasons include a low credit score, low income, a high debt-to-income ratio (DTI), an unstable work history, or an inability to meet basic requirements. Before applying for a personal, check the lender's criteria to determine if you will qualify.

            "content": "A step-by-step guide for lenders and borrowers Investopedia / Zoe Hansen A personal loan agreement is a contract between a lender and borrower spelling out the terms of a loan. Having one is usually a good idea whether you're lending money to family or friends or borrowing from them. It's a way to ensure that both parties understand their obligations. Additionally, a personal loan agreement document can be enforced in court if something goes wrong, such as the borrower failing to make payments. Here's what you need to know about writing a personal loan agreement. Personal loan agreements, sometimes called personal loan contracts, are legally binding documents that outline the repayment terms of a loan, which helps the borrower and lender understand the expectations of both parties. A personal loan contract can also stipulate whether the arrangement includes any collateral. While most personal loans are unsecured (i.e., there's no valuable asset used to back up the loan), it's possible for these arrangements to involve some collateral. A secured personal loan contract should include the situations in which a lender could claim the collateral if the debt goes unpaid. Most personal loan agreement documents include information about the borrower and lender, the loan amount, interest rate, fees, and repayment schedule, as well as how any disputes are to be settled, and what type of collateral (if any) will secure the loan. Personal loan documents are considered enforceable in court, so a borrower who doesn't meet their obligations could have a judgment levied against them, such as a lien or wage garnishment. When you take out a personal loan from a traditional lender like a bank, the lender will supply the contract. If you're lending to or borrowing from friends and family, you might need to write your own personal loan agreement. If there's only a small amount of money involved, a simple promissory note might be sufficient. However, in some cases, you may need a more complicated contract. Here are some of the items that should be included when creating such a contract: While not always necessary, it might make sense to have others witness the signatures (and sign as well) or to get the services of a notary to officiate over the signing. While many personal loan documents are quite simple, those for business-related loans can become more complicated. Some additional clauses you might consider: You can find personal loan agreement templates online, such as this one from the LawDistrict website: While you can write your own agreement from scratch, templates like the one above can make it easier. Here are some examples of how you might fill in a hypothetical template's sections. The Xs show which option you might have picked in sections where there are choices. 1. Parties.

The Lender has the right to remedy any breach of this Loan Agreement.

Lender's Signature: Jane Doe Date: 9/19/2025 Print Name: Jane Doe Borrower's Signature: John Doe Date: 9/19/2025 Print Name: John Doe The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also has a template online that you can use to make a personal loan agreement. No, notarizing a personal loan agreement isn't usually required. However, it can help to have an \"official\" record of the contract to encourage both parties to take the terms seriously. Yes, if all parties concerned are willing to change the agreement, it's possible to modify it. However, there should be a previously agreed-upon process to follow. In general, you should charge interest in line with the prevailing market. However, you are limited by state laws (usually the borrower's state) regarding usury. A promissory note can be considered a type of loan agreement. However, many promissory notes are much simpler than a full contract, simply stating the amount borrowed and when it should be repaid. Whenever you lend or borrow a significant amount of money, consider having a written loan agreement in place to protect both parties, especially when family and friends are involved. Putting a personal loan agreement down on paper can provide all parties with clear information about the terms of the loan, reduce any misunderstandings, and help prevent possible ill feelings in the future.

Klaus Vedfelt/Investopedia.com Borrowers with strong credit may find boat loan rates as low as 6.74% APR. Of course, the boat loan interest rate varies based on a number of factors, including the loan amount, length of loan, and the borrower\u2019s credit score and history. Boat loans work similar to personal loans, with a number of factors determining the interest rate on a boat loan. These include: Also, interest rates fluctuate depending on market conditions and inflation. There has been an increase in the boat loan interest rate because the Federal Reserve has raised rates to slow inflation. This has affected interest rates on many products. For instance, the average interest rate on a 30-year mortgage with a fixed interest rate is 6.20%. For new cars, the average auto loan interest rate is 5% to 7% for those with excellent credit and 7% to 9% for those with good credit. Additional factors that affect the cost of your boat loan include: To get an idea of how much you would pay for a boat loan, use our personal loan calculator. This varies by lenders, but some lenders will finance boats that are 20 years old or older if they are exceptionally valuable. There are a variety of lenders for boat loans, ranging from banks and credit unions to marine dealers. The interest rate represents the cost of the loan for the borrower and affects how much you pay each month on the loan. APR, or annual percentage rate, represents how much the loan costs each year. This includes not only the interest rate, but also the additional costs of the loan, such as origination fees, points, and other fees. Credit score requirements vary by lender, but the higher your credit score, the more likely you are to receive favorable terms on a boat loan. On average, boat loans are for between 10 and 15 years, but it\u2019s possible to get boat loans with shorter or longer loan terms. Typical down payments for a boat loan range between 10% and 20% of the purchase price. Beginning in Q2 2022, the Fed began increasing interest rates in an effort to slow record-high inflation, so rates could still possibly increase if the Fed's inflation target doesn't reach 2% or remain unchanged in the near term, depending on economic conditions. However, there are growing expectations that the Fed might begin to cut rates at some point in 2024. Interest rates on boat loans generally start around 6.74% for those with excellent credit. Several factors affect the interest rate a borrower will pay\u2014namely their credit score, the loan amount, the age of the boat, and the loan term. To get the best interest rate, shop around with different lenders to see which one offers the lowest rate and best loan terms.

            "content": "Use this tool to calculate the total cost and payments of your boat loan. Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images A brand new 20-foot boat could cost $40,000 to $60,000. Boat loans are a type of personal loan that you can use to finance the purchase of a marine vessel. You can use a personal loan calculator to understand the monthly payments and total cost of a boat loan. A boat loan is an installment loan that is used to finance the purchase of a watercraft. Similar to an auto loan or a mortgage, you will pay a boat loan back in monthly installments with interest. You can apply for a boat loan with a bank, credit union, online lender, or marine dealership. Some lenders offer loans specifically for boats. You can also explore general personal loans, which can be used to finance nearly any purchase. The total cost and monthly payments of your boat loan will depend on several factors. You can use a personal loan calculator to figure out your monthly payments and total loan cost. Imagine you want a boat loan to buy a $50,000 boat. If this loan has a five-year term and an 8.24% interest rate: Before you buy a boat, keep in mind the cost of your loan and the other considerations that come with being a boat owner. While your loan is a significant expense, it does not represent the total cost of owning a boat. Boat owners are also responsible for: For many people, owning a boat is a dream come true. But it is a big purchase, and you will want to keep in mind the value of your boat. Boats depreciate over time. Depreciation will depend on factors like brand and how well you maintain your boat. On average, a boat will depreciate 10% to 15% within a year of purchase and 20% to 30% within five years of purchase. Typically, a boat loan is a secured loan, meaning the boat serves as collateral in case the borrower defaults on the payments. The lender can repossess the boat and resell it to recoup the lent funds. If you have excellent credit, you could expect the interest rate on a 20-year boat loan to be about 8.24%. You can use a 20-year boat loan calculator or personal loan calculator to determine how your interest rate will impact the total cost of your loan. Boat loan terms and rates will vary. Terms of 10 to 15 years are typical. You can also find terms that are just a few years or up to 20 years. Boat loan down payments can range from 10% to 30%, depending on factors like your loan term and the age of the boat. Boats, similar to cars, tend to lose value over time. By the time you have owned a boat for five years, you can expect 20% to 30% depreciation. Securing a loan for an older boat may be challenging, but lenders are willing to offer loans on boats as old as 19 years. Some lenders may be willing to offer loans for even older boats if they are considered high-value. You can use a personal loan calculator as a new or used boat loan calculator. This tool will help you determine how much your monthly payments will be and the lifetime cost of the loan. Comparing boat loans can help you to find the best rates and terms.

            "content": "If you want to buy a boat, there are loans available to finance your purchase Investopedia / Joules Garcia Boat loans are a type of personal loan for borrowers who want to purchase a boat. These loans are similar to auto loans. Several different types of lenders offer boat loans. Some lenders offer boat-specific loans, but many offer personal loans that can be used for most purposes, including the purchase of a boat. Boat loans are installment loans, which means you will repay the amount borrowed in monthly amounts with interest. Typical considerations include: Secured boat loans require collateral. In most cases, the boat you purchase will serve as the collateral. If you are unable to make your loan payments, your lender could seize the boat. Lenders may offer secured loans to people who have poor credit. Unsecured boat loans don't require collateral. Lenders will decide to offer an unsecured loan based on the borrower's creditworthiness. This type of boat loan may come with a higher interest rate because it's riskier for the lender. A home equity loan, also referred to as a second mortgage, enables homeowners to borrow against the equity they have in their homes. This is a type of secured loan; your home serves as collateral. Home equity loans tend to have low interest rates, but if you're unable to repay the loan, you risk losing your home. Boat loans are a type of personal loan, but you can also consider a general personal loan to finance your purchase. Personal loans can be used to cover a wide variety of expenses, including a boat. The interest rates and terms of personal loans can vary significantly by lender. Boat loans may also be referred to vessel loans. Vessel loans can also be used to finance purchases of commercial watercrafts. Some banks offer boat loans. For example, Regions Bank offers loans up to $75,000. Interest rates start at 9.24%, and its loan terms range from one to five years. Credit unions are nonprofit, member-owned institutions, and some offer boat financing. Patelco Credit Union has interest rates starting at 7.99% and loan terms of up to 15 years. Many online lenders specialize in personal loans, which can make them a good option for boat loans. SoFi offers loans up to $100,000. If you have excellent credit, you could qualify for an interest rate as low as 8.99%. The lender has loan terms of two to seven years. You may be able to apply for a loan through a marine dealership that sells boats. Some dealerships partner with boat loan providers to give customers access to dealer financing options. Before you apply for a boat loan, be sure to first consider: The interest rate on a boat loan is affected by market conditions, your creditworthiness, and the individual lender. As of September 2024, borrowers with excellent credit could expect to find interest rates on a 20-year boat loan starting at approximately 6.74%. You will find a wide range of terms for boat loans. Ten to 15 year terms is common. You can also find terms for just a couple of years or as long as 20 years. Many lenders provide boat loans. You can explore options offered by banks, credit unions, online lenders, and marine finance companies. The application requirements and process will vary depending on the lender. Super yachts are extravagant vessels that are significantly larger than standard private yachts. These yachts are purchased by multimillionaires and billionaires. Buyers can pay upfront. Alternatively, they can explore leasing options or a marine mortgage. A boat loan can be a useful financing option if you have always dreamed of getting out on the water in your own boat. Like any other loan, it's important to consider all of your options and compare interest rates and loan terms before making a decision.

A/C Kohler Photography Boat loan terms can be as short as five years, but typically, they are between 10 to 20 years. The exact length of a boat loan depends on a number of factors, including the loan amount, the age of the boat, and the type of boat. Learn more about how to determine the right boat loan term for you. As with other types of loans, a number of factors can affect the financing terms on boat loans. Boat loans include many of the same terms you\u2019ll find with other loans. The interest rate and type of loan could also affect the loan terms. For a boat loan with a fixed interest rate, the monthly loan payments will remain the same for the entire term of the loan.\u00a0For a boat loan with a variable interest rate, the; rate could change frequently, meaning the monthly payment could increase or decrease throughout the loan term. With a secured loan, the lender uses the boat as collateral, meaning if you miss payments and default on the loan, the lender has the right to repossess the boat and sell it to pay off the loan. With an unsecured loan, you won\u2019t risk losing your boat if you miss payments. However, unsecured loans could require a higher down payment and/or higher interest rate since the lender bears higher risk. Boat loans are available through numerous lenders ranging from your local financial institution to qualified marine brokers.\u00a0So, like other types of personal loans, boat loans can be found online and through brick-and-mortar providers. Many banks and credit unions offer boat loans, so when shopping for a boat loan, talk with a banking professional at your current bank or credit union. You may receive more favorable loan terms, such as lower interest rates, if you are a current customer. Because they don\u2019t have the same operating costs as brick-and-mortar financial institutions, online lenders often offer lower interest rates on loans, including boat loans. When shopping for a boat loan, check with a variety of online lenders to see how they compare on loan terms. Just as car dealers offer financing when you purchase a vehicle, boat dealers can also offer financing. However, dealer financing could have higher interest rates or include additional fees compared to other lenders like your bank or credit union. Other ways to finance a boat purchase aside from a boat loan include a home equity loan or a personal loan. If you own a home and have established equity, you can take out a loan through a mortgage lender that allows you to use that equity as collateral. A home equity loan is an installment loan in which you receive money in a lump sum that you repay over time. A home equity line of credit (HELOC) also uses your home as collateral, but instead of a lump sum of money, you receive a credit line that works similarly to a credit card. You can use as much of the credit line as you need and only pay interest on those borrowed funds. When you repay what you borrowed, you can borrow it again. Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit can provide a larger sum of money for a lower interest rate because the loan is backed by collateral, making it lower risk for lenders. However, if you cannot repay these loans, you risk losing your house to foreclosure. If you have good credit, you may qualify for an unsecured personal loan to purchase a boat.\u00a0Personal loans are approved based on your credit score and financial information like your income but are not backed by collateral. Interest rates on personal loans tend to be higher than on secured boat loans, but you can use personal loans for a range of purposes. With a personal loan, you receive a lump sum of money to use toward your expenses. Then, you repay that loan over a set amount of time. Terms of personal loans generally range from two to five years. Many lenders offer a maximum of $30,000 to $50,000, but some lenders may provide as much as $100,000. Lenders typically will not finance boat loans for boats older than 20 years.\u00a0If you want to purchase an older boat, you may need to get an unsecured personal loan that can be used for a broad range of purposes, including buying a boat. Credit score requirements vary by lender, but could be as low as 550 for some lenders.\u00a0The lower your credit score, the higher you will likely be charged in interest. Interest rates depend on a number of factors, but typically start between 6% and 7%.\u00a0This varies by lender, but your local bank or credit union is a good place to start. Fall is usually the slow season for buying boats, so you could potentially find a great deal on a boat, including good loan terms. You may be able to get a good deal on a boat when newer boat models are introduced or when your local boat show is held. As with other types of vehicles, boat values depreciate over time, so the older the boat, the lower its value. Boats rarely increase in value like other assets such as homes. Boat loans typically range between 10 and 20 years, depending on how much the loan amount is, the age of the boat, and the type of boat. Boat loans are available from several lenders, including banks, credit unions, online lenders, boat dealers, and marine brokers. The right length of boat loan will depend on your budget and funding needs.

            "content": "Most lenders will require a credit score of about 680 or higher Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images Different lenders will have different credit score requirements. If you want to apply for a boat loan, you can expect most lenders to require a minimum score of 680. However, some lenders will work with borrowers who have lower credit scores. A boat loan is a type of personal loan that is used to finance the purchase of a marine vessel. Boat loans can be secured or unsecured. Unsecured loans do not require any collateral, while secured loans are backed by collateral. In the case of a boat loan, your boat would serve as collateral. If you are unable to make the payments on your loan, the lender can take possession of the boat. You can use a personal loan calculator to determine how much your monthly payments will be and the total cost of your loan with interest. Lenders look at your credit score to assess your risk as a borrower. Borrowers with higher credit scores represent less risk, which means they will likely qualify for better loan terms and lower interest rates. Your credit score is a three-digit number from 300 to 850. Credit scores are broken into different ranges: Lenders set their own minimum credit scores for borrowers. While a credit score of 680 or higher is a typical minimum for personal loans, that is not the case with all lenders. In addition to your credit score, lenders will consider your income and debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Lenders want to know that you have enough income to repay the loan. Your DTI shows lenders how much of your income goes toward paying your existing debt. If you have a low income and a high DTI, lenders will consider you a higher-risk borrower. A high income and a low DTI are considered lower risk, which will translate into more favorable terms and interest rates. You can apply for a boat loan with various lenders, including: Once you choose a lender, gather the information required to apply. Lenders will typically ask for personal information on your income, assets, and debt. Some lenders require you to apply in person, while others offer online application processes. A boat loan can finance the purchase of a boat, but the monthly payments on your loan are not the only expenses to consider. Boat owners also have to pay for registration, maintenance, repairs, gas, taxes, boat insurance, docking fees, and storage. Consider the other costs of owning a boat along with your loan payments before you get a loan. It is possible to get a boat loan with bad credit, but you may need to make a larger down payment, use a cosigner, or apply for a secured loan. Taking out a boat loan or any kind of personal loan is not inherently harmful to your credit score. The hard credit inquiry a lender conducts when you apply for the loan may cause a temporary drop in your score. Plus, taking on new debt can also lower your score. But, making on-time payments can improve your credit score over time. Interest rates for borrowers with excellent credit start around 7.87%; anything under 8% would be a good rate. Boat loan term lengths vary, but 10- to 15-year terms are typical. You can get a boat loan with a bank, credit union, online lender or marine dealership. Each lender will have different borrower requirements and application processes. You can compare a few options to decide what is easiest for you. You may find it more challenging to secure a loan for an older boat, but there are lenders that will finance boats as old as 19 years. You might be able to get a loan for an even older boat if it is valuable. Borrowers with a credit score of 680 or higher will be more likely to secure a boat loan, but some lenders work with borrowers who have lower credit scores. You can also explore the possibility of a secured loan or working with a cosigner to make your dream of boat ownership a reality.

            "content": "Bank of America and Chase are among the banks that don\u2019t offer personal loans Shapeimage / Getty Images If you're planning to apply for a personal loan, you might think a big bank is your first stop. However, some banks may only offer personal loans to existing customers, and some big banks don't offer personal loans at all. For instance, Bank of America, Chase, and Capital One are among the nation's largest banks that don't offer personal loans. Instead of a big bank, your best bet may be to compare the best personal loans and then decide which is right for you. Banks are financial institutions that offer many different types of financial products, including checking and savings accounts, credit cards, and mortgages. Unsecured personal loans aren't typically larger banks' main focus, but many smaller banks do offer personal loans. Some banks may simply determine that personal loans don't fit into their other loan offerings. A personal loan is typically an unsecured loan that you can get for varying amounts, normally ranging from $1,000 to $50,000, but sometimes as much as $100,000. You repay the loan back in regular monthly payments with interest. If you are planning to apply for a personal loan, keep in mind there are a few major banks that don't offer this type of loan, including Bank of America, Chase, and Capital One. While Bank of America doesn't offer personal loans, it does offer numerous other personal financing options in addition to its checking and savings accounts. You can apply for a variety of credit cards, such as rewards credit cards, student credit cards, or credit-building credit cards. Bank of America also offers home loans like mortgages, home equity loans, refinanced mortgages, as well as auto loans. Finally, it offers credit cards and lending services for businesses. Although Chase is a big bank that doesn't offer personal loans, it does offer other types of lending products like personal credit cards, home loans, and auto loans. Chase also offers deposit products like checking, savings and CD options. Businesses and commercial enterprises can also explore numerous financing solutions with Chase. Personal loans aren't available through Capital One, but it does offer many different lending options for individuals and businesses. You can apply for credit cards with different rewards programs, such as travel points or cash back rewards. You can also get an auto loan through Capital One. Businesses and commercial lending services can apply for credit cards and lines of credit. While some of the nation's largest banks don't provide personal loans, borrowers still have plenty of options for getting financing for their needs. As you consider your choices, you can use a personal loan calculator to figure out your monthly payments and the total cost of the loan based on its APR and term. Keep in mind that some banks and other financial institutions will only offer personal loans to existing customers. For example, you must have an active American Express Consumer Card to apply for a personal loan with American Express. Smaller regional or community banks may also be potential sources for personal loans once an account relationship has been established. Many online lenders specialize in personal loans. Online lenders may be more willing than banks to work with borrowers who have poor credit, in particular. If you are looking for a quick loan, some online lenders are able to offer same-day funding. For example, Rocket Loans will submit an ACH credit to your bank account if you complete the loan process and sign the promissory note by 1 p.m. ET on a business day. You can compare online personal loan rates to find the best option for you. Credit unions are non-profit, member-owned enterprises that provide banking services. Borrowers may be able to get a personal loan with a lower interest rate at a credit union than at a bank. In the third quarter of 2024, the national average interest rate for an unsecured fixed rate loan with a 36-month term offered by credit unions was 10.89%. The national average for banks was 11.94%. Credit unions typically require you to become a member before they will offer you a personal loan. Credit unions can be state-chartered or federally chartered. Like you would any other financial institution, you can compare options to determine the best credit union for your needs. Personal loans aren't the right fit for everyone. Borrowers can consider alternatives like a credit card, a line of credit, or borrowing money from a retirement account. Each borrowing option has pros and cons to weigh before you decide what works best for you. Banks vet personal loan applications based on many different criteria, including your credit score, your income, and your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. If your personal loan application is denied, your credit score or income may be too low or your DTI ratio may be too high. It's also possible you made a mistake on your application. Banks and other creditors are required to tell you why your application was rejected under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). The best personal loan rates will depend on your eligibility. If you have a high credit score and high income, you're a desirable loan candidate and likely to qualify for a lower interest rate. Pre-qualifying for a few different loans can help you compare interest rates and loan terms without affecting your credit score. Lenders have varying credit score requirements. Some lenders are willing to work with people who have poor or fair credit, some aren't. Typically, a credit score of 670 or higher will give you access to the best personal loan terms. The approval process for getting a personal loan will vary depending on the bank. You can typically expect loan approval and funding to take one to five business days. Not all big banks will offer personal loans, but you can explore options at other banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Pre-qualifying for loans and comparing rates can help you find the best personal loan for you without impacting your credit.

Maskot / Getty Images If you are looking for a loan to buy a new vehicle, you have several options. You can get a car loan from many lenders, but the most popular are banks and credit unions. Auto loans from credit unions work in much the same way as a car loan from a bank. As a\u00a0personal loan, you borrow money from the credit union and then pay it back with interest over a\u00a0defined length of time. The main difference is that a loan from a credit union often has a lower interest rate than a loan from a bank\u2014however, you\u2019ll have to join the credit union to apply for one. Learn more about the main differences between auto loans from credit unions and those from banks so you can decide which is right for you. Whether you apply with a bank or a credit union, the best auto loan rates vary from lender to lender. You can potentially save thousands by getting a lower rate, so take the time to shop around. Credit unions and banks both offer car loans that work similarly, but there can be significant differences between them. Many of these differences stem from the more fundamental difference between a credit union and a bank. A credit union is a type of financial cooperative that provides traditional banking services like loans and mortgages. Some credit unions are small, but others have thousands of members and operate nationwide. Unlike banks, credit unions are owned and operated by their members and don\u2019t operate for profit. This means that they can often offer lower interest rates than banks. In many other respects, a car loan from a bank and a car loan from a credit union are quite similar. You can use Investopedia\u2019s car loan calculator to calculate how much you\u2019ll pay for your auto loan, whether it\u2019s from a bank, a credit union, or another type of lender. To get a car loan from a credit union or a bank, you\u2019ll need to provide documents such as: A key difference between car loans from credit unions and car loans from banks is that you need to be a member of a credit union to take a loan out. The requirements for membership vary by credit union, and you may not qualify to join any credit union. However, many credit unions offer a quick, easy online application service. Whether you get a car loan from a bank or a credit union, your loan will have similar basic features: Before you sign any auto loan, read the contract carefully. You should also look for additional costs like the following, which could increase your borrowing costs: You can get pre-approved for a car loan quickly\u2014sometimes within minutes\u2014whether you are applying through a bank or a credit union. Getting a car loan through a credit union rather than a bank can have several advantages. These include: These advantages mean that car loans from credit unions are generally a better financial choice than a car loan from a bank (or a dealership). However, car loans from credit unions do have drawbacks to keep in mind\u2014primarily, you must qualify to be a member and join the credit union. The major disadvantage of an auto loan from a credit union is convenience. To apply for an auto loan from a credit union, you\u2019ll have to be a member first. With some credit unions, you might even have to be a member for a number of months (or even years) before you can access the best rates on car loans. If you want to buy a new vehicle soon, you might not have time to go through this process, and a bank loan may be your best option. However, it may be worth joining a credit union to access a loan with lower rates for your next vehicle. Since credit unions are member-driven and not-for-profit, members can often receive higher interest rates on savings, lower rates on loans, and lower fees. Credit unions typically have criteria for joining, can offer more customized services, and have better terms on their financial products. The credit score that banks use for auto loans depends on the bank and the type of loan. The three major credit bureaus are Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. The two credit-scoring models used by auto lenders are FICO Auto Score and VantageScore. Banks may check either type of credit score before they approve your loan. The average interest rate on a 60-month new-car loan was 6.36% from a credit union and 7.39% from a bank as of the second quarter (Q2) of 2024. The average interest rate on a 48-month used-car loan was 6.42% at a credit union and 7.69% at a bank as of the same quarter. An interest rate below these amounts can be considered good. How long it will take to get approved for a car loan will depend on the credit union. Many credit unions offer quick application processes and will give you a decision on your loan within one business day. However, you\u2019ll have to be a member of the credit union to apply for a loan. Car loans from credit unions can be less convenient than car loans from banks because you will have to become a member of the credit union first and may have to wait before you can apply for a loan. However, credit union auto loans are generally more affordable than auto loans from banks. They tend to offer lower interest rates, longer and more flexible repayment terms, lower fees, and more personalized customer service.

Aaron Greene / Getty Images If you keep missing your car loan payments, your lender will eventually declare that it is in default. This may happen after as little as 30 days and up to 90 days, depending on the terms set by your lender. Your car may be repossessed at this point, and your lender will pass your loan on to a collection agency (known as charging off the loan). Your credit score may also take a significant hit. Missing a car loan can have several damaging effects. However, if you can\u2019t afford your car loan, you likely have better options than simply not paying it. These options depend on your financial situation, loan type, and how much you have left to pay. Millions of Americans are struggling to make their car repayments on time. According to Federal Reserve data, 7.9% of auto loans moved into delinquency in the first quarter of 2024. If you stop making payments on your car loan, you can face several negative consequences. Each payment you miss may incur late payment fees and negatively impact your credit score.\u00a0Even if you start repaying your auto loan at a later date and avoid any further consequences, you\u2019ll end up paying more interest on your loan because it will take longer to pay off. If you keep missing payments, your lender will warn you that you are not adhering to the loan terms and may threaten to repossess your vehicle. Once you are 30 to 90 days late on your repayments, your lender will likely say that your loan is in default. Once you\u2019re in default, the lender may be able to repossess your car anytime, without notice, and come onto your property to take it. If your car is repossessed, your lender will try to sell it at an auction or in a private sale to recover their money.\u00a0If they sell it at an auction, you may be able to buy it back. You will still owe the lender the difference between what you still owe on your loan (plus expenses) and what your lender gets for selling the car. This is called a deficiency, and your lender will pursue you for it. In most states, they can even sue you to recover this money. In short, you can\u2019t get out of your car loan if you simply stop paying it. If you can\u2019t afford your car loan, there are likely better options to help you stay in financial health. Each time you are late with a car loan payment, this will be recorded on your credit report. Multiple missed payments might have a significant negative effect on your credit score. If you can\u2019t afford your car loan repayments, the first thing to do is to talk to your lender as soon as possible. Many lenders will work with you to avoid losing money. They may offer you one or more of these options: If your lender can\u2019t offer you affordable terms, you have a few debt relief options, including voluntary repossession, refinancing, or selling your car. You can call your lender and tell them you can no longer repay the loan. This is called a voluntary repossession. Your lender will take physical possession of your car and then sell it to recoup some losses. You\u2019ll owe them the difference between what you owed and the amount they sold the car for. With voluntary repossession, you won\u2019t face the high fees of an involuntary repossession. However, a voluntary repossession can stay on your credit report for up to seven years. If your lender can\u2019t change the terms of your current loan, you might be able to refinance your car loan with the same lender or a new lender. Refinancing a car loan can lower your interest rate or extend your repayment term, both of which can lower the amount of your monthly payment. Many auto lenders allow you to get pre-qualified for a loan before you submit an official application. This process makes it possible to compare interest rate quotes, repayment terms, and monthly payments from multiple lenders with just a soft credit check, which won\u2019t impact your credit score. To find the best personal loans available for refinancing, it's best to shop and compare. Perhaps the easiest way to get out of your car loan is to sell your car and use the money from the sale to pay off the loan. If you sell your car for more than you owe, you can use the difference to buy a new car. If you owe more than you get from selling it, you\u2019ll still need to repay this difference to your lender. The number of car payments you can miss before your car is repossessed depends on the lender, but two or three missed payments can lead to a repossession. A repossession will stay on your credit report for about seven years, starting from the first missed payment that led to the repossession. The number of times you can defer a car payment will depend on the lender. Some may allow you to defer several payments, but others will only let you defer one. Most loans have a grace period, such as 10 or 15 days, when you can make a payment and won\u2019t be charged a late fee. Delaying your payments any longer risks incurring fees and eventual repossession if you keep missing payments. If you don\u2019t pay your car insurance, it will lapse. This means your car won\u2019t be insured, and it might be illegal to drive it. Your car will eventually be repossessed if you don\u2019t pay your car loan. Before that point, you\u2019ll be charged late fees for your missed payments, your credit score will take a significant hit, and you may be charged fees for repossession. If you can\u2019t afford your car loan, you should first talk to your lender, who may be able to offer you lower or more flexible repayment terms. Alternatively, you can sell your vehicle and use the proceeds to pay off your loan or have it voluntarily repossessed.

Katleho Seisa / Getty Images A credit union is a type of financial institution similar to a bank that provides a range of banking services. Unlike banks, however, credit unions are owned and operated by their members. Some credit unions are small and serve individual neighborhoods, while others have nationwide coverage. To get financial services from a credit union, you\u2019ll need to become a member. Credit unions offer many of the same financial services as banks, including access to personal loans. Personal loans from credit unions often have benefits like lower interest rates, options for smaller loan amounts, more flexible terms, and less stringent approval requirements. Many of the best personal loans available are from credit unions. Credit unions have several advantages over banks. The primary benefit of using a credit union is that, since a credit union is not run for profit, it can often offer lower interest rates than traditional and online lenders. Many credit union users also value the more personalized service that credit unions can offer to their members. You\u2019ll first have to become a member of a credit union before you can apply for its loans. Each credit union has its own membership criteria, but many now allow you to apply online. You\u2019ll generally have to make a small deposit to open your membership ($5 to $25), but once you are a member, you can apply for a personal loan. At this point, a personal loan from a credit union works in much the same way as a loan from a bank. The credit union will assess your application and decide whether to lend to you. While credit union membership is a required first step to apply for a credit union loan, membership alone won\u2019t necessarily improve your chances of getting approved unless your credit is excellent or you have guaranteed employment, such as serving in the military. If you are approved for a credit union personal loan, the credit union will pay you a lump sum, which you will pay back (with interest) in fixed monthly installments. You can use a personal loan for a variety of purposes, whether you get the loan from a credit union, a bank, or an online lender. Some lenders may ask what you plan to do with the money, while others will just want to be certain that you can pay it back. Personal loans are often used for: However, before you opt for a personal loan, you\u2019ll want to ensure this is the right financing option for you. You should consider whether there may be less expensive options for you to borrow money depending on your situation. For example, you may be able to get a lower interest rate if you have home equity that you can use toward a home equity loan. Or a credit card with a 0% introductory interest rate could provide free funding if you can repay the money before the introductory period ends. Some reasons for choosing a personal loan are: To qualify for a personal loan from a credit union, you\u2019ll first have to become a member. Each credit union has different criteria for becoming a member, and you may not qualify to join each one. However, there are a range of credit unions, and you can likely find one that fits you. Once you are a member, you can apply for a range of financial services, including personal loans. Eligibility requirements for personal loans from credit unions are less strict than a bank\u2019s criteria. In particular, a low credit score may not disqualify you from a loan with a credit union because a credit union is more likely to take into account your overall financial circumstances. However, a good credit score will likely get a lower interest rate. Check your credit score before applying for a personal loan. If your score is lower than you would like and you can delay taking out a personal loan, then you can take steps to improve it, such as paying down your debt. A personal loan, whether from a bank or a credit union, is typically an unsecured loan. This means that the lender does not require collateral\u2014a home or a car, for example\u2014to borrow money. To apply for a personal loan from a credit union, you\u2019ll have to complete a number of steps. First, you\u2019ll need to apply for membership in the credit union. Every credit union has its own requirements and process for this, but some will now allow you to apply online. To join a credit union, you might have to make a small deposit to open your account. Once you have an account, you can apply for a personal loan. Some credit unions will allow you to apply for a loan online. Others will require you to visit a credit union branch. Similarly, each credit union will ask for different information as part of your loan application. You should expect to provide personal and contact information, a Social Security number, employment and income details, and any debts you already have. After you apply, the credit union will consider it and decide whether it can lend to you and at what interest rate and loan term.\u00a0This check may have a temporary, small negative impact on your credit score, but it should disappear in a few months to a year. If you are approved, you can expect to receive funds in a few days to a few weeks, depending on the credit union. A low credit score generally won\u2019t automatically disqualify you from a personal loan from a credit union. However, lenders will check to ensure that you can repay the loan, especially if it\u2019s unsecured. Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, to Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. Credit union personal loans are different from bank personal loans in several ways, both positive and negative. In general, credit unions offer better interest rates and more personal services. However, credit unions may take longer to fund your loan. Typically offer lower interest rates on personal loans Lower eligibility requirements, particularly for borrowers with low credit scores Emphasis on strong customer service Lower fees and prepayment penalties on personal loans May take longer to get a loan funded, since you have to apply for membership first Higher interest rates, making the loan more expensive in the long term Less emphasis on personalized customer service Fast, easy application May charge higher fees and prepayment penalties Larger banks offer convenience with access to multiple branches, ATMs, and online and mobile banking technology Membership in a credit union is based on a common criteria often called a field of membership. This can be working for a particular employer or industry, or simply living or working in a specified geographical area. How you join a credit union depends on the credit union\u2019s process, as each has its own requirements. Some credit unions will allow you to apply online by filling out an application with your personal information. Others may require you to visit a branch to apply. The minimum credit score for a personal loan will vary by credit union. It\u2019s possible to get a personal loan from some credit unions with a low credit score. The credit union will likely use other criteria to make sure you can repay the loan. Credit unions may charge fees, but they tend to charge fewer and less expensive fees than banks charge. Whether a credit union charges fees depends on the credit union\u2019s individual policy. Once you are a member of a credit union and have applied for a loan, it can take anywhere from one to 10 working days to be approved. The exact time it will take depends on the credit union. A personal loan is often the least expensive way to borrow, and you can get a personal loan from a variety of providers. Personal loans from credit unions generally have lower interest rates and fees than equivalent loans from banks or online lenders. The disadvantage is convenience. To get a loan, you\u2019ll have to join a credit union first, and it may take longer for your loan to be approved.

Charday Penn / Getty Images Most personal loans are for $1,000 to $50,000, although some lenders will consider loans of up to $100,000 in some cases. Many personal loans are for a lot less. The average personal loan balance for new originations in the third quarter (Q3) of 2023 was $19,402, according to Experian research. The best personal loans have low interest rates, but large personal loans can have large monthly payments even with low interest rates. Weigh the pros and cons before taking out a large personal loan. Personal loans are often unsecured, meaning you don\u2019t have to risk your assets as collateral. For lenders, personal loans are riskier because they have no collateral to use to recoup losses if you fail to make payments. As a result, interest rates for unsecured personal loans tend to be higher than for loans like mortgages or auto loans, and lenders are hesitant to offer large, unsecured personal loans. Most lenders state that their maximum personal loan amount is $50,000, though some will go as high as $100,000. Some borrowers, usually wealthy and with high credit scores, might be able to borrow more. Here are the personal loan ranges for the best personal loan lenders in 2023: You can calculate how much a personal loan will cost you using Investopedia\u2019s personal loans calculator. Even though most lenders may lend up to $50,000 on a personal loan, the maximum amount you can borrow depends on several factors about your financial situation. These are: The amount you should borrow with a personal loan depends on what you want to use it for and your personal financial circumstances. You can use a personal loan for almost any expense (with exceptions such as a mortgage down payment), but large loans can be expensive if you don\u2019t pay them off quickly. In general, you should get the smallest personal loan that meets your requirements and pay it back as quickly as you can. This will minimize the impact of your interest rate, thus making the loan less expensive overall. When you decide how much you should borrow with a personal loan, consider: If you are denied a personal loan for the amount you need, even after trying several loan providers, your options are somewhat limited. However, there are alternative steps you can take. First, you can find a co-signer\u2014ideally someone with a high income and good credit\u2014to co-sign your loan application. Lenders will then be more willing to offer you a larger loan. Some lenders offer large loans to people whose credit score wouldn\u2019t qualify them for a personal loan with a regular lender. However, these lenders tend to charge high interest rates, which can make these loans very expensive over the long term. You could also consider alternative ways of raising cash. If you can sell your vehicle or other household goods, you can raise money quickly. Finally, if you have equity invested in your home, you can also consider a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC). These loans use your home equity as collateral to secure a loan that can provide lower interest rates. If you cannot afford to repay a home equity loan or a HELOC, you risk losing your home. There are also ways to raise the maximum personal loan you can get over the long term. Specifically: Most lenders consider a credit score of 640 as the minimum for a personal loan. Some lenders will offer loans to people with lower credit scores, but these loans tend to be expensive. With most lenders, you can use your personal loan for just about anything. Some lenders base your personal loan rate on your loan purpose, while others restrict how you can use your loan. For instance, some might not allow you to use funds to pay for higher education or business expenses. The personal loan amount that is right for you depends on your circumstances. But you should make sure you can easily afford your repayments over the life of the loan. The best personal loan lenders in 2024 offer personal loans with rates from 8% to 25%. Your loan rate will depend on the size of the loan and your credit score, but a rate below 15% is generally considered good. Most personal loan providers offer personal loans of up to $50,000, but only for borrowers with high credit scores and incomes. In rare cases, it\u2019s possible to get personal loans for $100,000 or even more. The maximum amount you can borrow on a personal loan will depend on your credit score, income, debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, and the lender\u2019s criteria.

He has published widely on personal finance, marketing, and the impact of technology on contemporary arts and culture. Luis Alvarez / Getty Images You can apply for a personal loan from a variety of lenders. While banks remain the most popular provider of personal loans, some of the best personal loans are offered by online lenders and credit unions. The loans provided by these other organizations have pros and cons. Personal loans from online lenders are quick to fund but might have higher interest rates. Loans from credit unions generally have low interest rates but are less convenient because you\u2019ll need to join the union first. Ultimately, aim to choose a loan based on its terms, including its interest rate, how long you have to pay it back, and whether you can qualify for it. So, before you get a personal loan, it\u2019s best to shop around at different financial institutions. Investopedia\u2019s personal loan calculator can help you calculate the total cost of a personal loan, whether it\u2019s from a bank or another source. Many online lenders offer personal loans. The main advantage of these loans is that they are convenient. You can apply online, sometimes within a few minutes. Some lenders will send you your money within that day. Digital lending platforms also allow you to easily compare loan terms so you can get the best terms and the best fit for you. Some online lenders are more willing to work with people with lower credit scores than others. You should still check to see if you can repay the loan. Many online lenders will offer a pre-approval with a soft credit check, which does not affect your credit score. When you officially apply for the loan, the lender will conduct a hard credit check, which can have a small, temporary impact on your credit score. Convenience Speed Easier eligibility High interest rates Customer service Credit unions are financial cooperatives that offer many of the same financial products as banks, like savings accounts, mortgages, and personal loans. Because credit unions aren\u2019t run for profit, the best credit unions can offer interest rates on loans that are significantly lower than those offered by banks and online lenders. The disadvantage is that you\u2019ll have to become a member of the credit union before applying for a loan, which can take some time. To apply for a loan from a credit union, you\u2019ll have to join the union first. Each union has its own rules about membership, but many will allow you to apply online. Once you are a member, credit unions typically have less strict eligibility requirements for personal loans than banks. They may approve you for a loan even if you have a low credit score, or they may be more willing to consider your financial or personal circumstances. Some credit unions allow you to apply for a personal loan online, while others may require you to visit a branch before you accept the loan. You can get a personal loan from many different lenders, such as U.S. Bank, Old National Bank, Teachers Federal Credit Union, NASA Federal, and more. You can check with your financial institution, too. So, if you have a NASA Federal account already, you may find that NASA Federal also has personal loans. Lower interest rates Lower eligibility requirements Customer service Membership required Smaller loans For many people, the benefits of personal loans are that they are a cost-effective way of borrowing a lump-sum amount that you can repay in regular payments over time. However, not everyone will qualify for an unsecured personal loan. The most common reason for this is a low credit score. Alternative financing options for personal loans include: If you don\u2019t need the money immediately, joining a credit union can allow borrowers with bad credit to get a personal loan. Alternatively, you can get a personal loan from an online lender, but make sure you understand the cost of the loan and compare several options. Online lenders offer a convenient way to get a personal loan. You can apply online and will typically receive your money within a few days. Some online lenders offer very fast application processes for their loans, so you\u2019ll receive your money almost instantly. However, make sure you understand the costs of these loans before taking one because some can have very high interest rates or other fees. Yes. There are three ways to borrow money from PayPal: PayPal business loans, PayPal working capital, and PayPal credit. A loan app allows you to borrow money through the app. EarnIn, Dave, and Brigit allow you to borrow small amounts of money and repay it from your next paycheck. However, this kind of loan can get expensive if you fall behind on your payments. There are three main providers of personal loans: banks, online lenders, and credit unions. If you don\u2019t qualify for a personal loan from a bank, then online lenders and credit unions can be a good alternative. Each lender has advantages and disadvantages, so make sure you understand the cost of your loan before accepting it.

Rolf Bruderer / Getty Images You can get a personal loan from a bank, an online lender, or a credit union, and you can use it to buy almost anything, including a car. Though it\u2019s more common to use an auto loan to buy a car, taking out a personal loan can make sense in some circumstances. For example, you may want to use a personal loan if you don\u2019t want to make a down payment or are buying from a private seller. Look for a personal loan with a low interest rate and a repayment schedule that works for you from a lender you trust. A personal loan is typically an unsecured loan that you can use for a variety of purposes. You may use a personal loan to consolidate debt, pay for home renovations, or buy a car. Personal loans can be offered by banks, credit unions, or online lenders. The money you borrow must be repaid over time, typically with interest, and interest rates can vary depending on your lender and credit score. Some lenders may also charge fees. An auto loan works in a similar way but with some key differences. Auto loans are secured, which means they require some collateral. In this case, your collateral is your new car\u2014if you fail to pay back the loan, your lender can repossess your car to recoup the cost of the loan. In addition, auto loans can only be used to buy a car, and most can only be used to buy a car less than 10 years old. Flexibility Fast access No collateral Higher interest rates Shorter terms Limited availability for borrowers with bad credit For most borrowers looking to finance a vehicle purchase, an auto loan will be the better option. Auto loans generally have lower interest rates than personal loans, longer repayment periods, and lower monthly repayments. If you want to buy a vehicle from a private seller, using a personal loan might be a good option because you can access the cash quickly. Using a personal loan for a car is a fairly straightforward process that begins with shopping for a car and a lender. Here is a step-by-step summary of how to use a personal loan to buy a car. To apply for a loan, you\u2019ll first need to know how much you need to borrow, so consider which car you want to buy before applying. That way, you know the price of the car and how much to apply to borrow. Next, shop around for the best loan deal. You should look for the loan with the lowest annual percentage rate (APR) and monthly payments you can easily afford. Your interest rate and other terms will be determined by your credit score, so it\u2019s a good idea to check your credit score before applying for a loan. You can often get pre-qualified with a soft credit check, which can help you compare your eligible loans. You can apply for a personal loan with a bank, an online lender, or a credit union. Most lenders allow you to apply online, though credit unions will require you to become a member first. The application process will entail providing your financial information and personal information, such as your Social Security number and address. This information will help the financial institution run a credit check and assess your risk as a borrower. If the lender approves your application, you should receive your money in your bank account within a few days. You can then use this money to buy your new car through whatever forms of payment the dealer accepts, such as a cashier\u2019s check, a personal check, or a credit card payment. After you\u2019ve taken out your personal loan, you\u2019ll need to make monthly repayments on it according to the terms of the agreement. If you fail to make the payments on time, your lender will likely charge you late fees. In addition, missed payments can damage your credit score, which will impact your ability to qualify for future loans. Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, to Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. An auto loan is generally the best option to finance a car purchase because it offers the lowest rates, as it uses the car as collateral. However, in some circumstances, a personal loan might make more sense. These include situations such as if you are buying from a private seller or have a low credit score. Auto loans are available at financial institutions and dealerships. You can use an auto loan from a bank or credit union to buy a loan from a private seller, but not all financial institutions offer private-party auto loans. So, a personal loan might be a good option if you are buying a vehicle from a private seller. If you can wait a few months and save up for a down payment on a car, you can likely get a loan with lower rates. If you have a low credit score, you might not be able to get an auto loan. You will likely have a more difficult time getting a personal loan as well. However, some lenders specialize in personal loans for people with bad credit. The downside to getting a personal loan with a low credit score is that you will face higher interest rates, which can make the loan very expensive. If you can, consider delaying your car purchase and work on improving your credit score by paying down debt and making timely payments before you apply for either a car loan or a personal loan. You can use a personal loan for almost any purpose, including a car purchase. An auto loan is likely to be the better option for most people because it offers lower rates by using your car as collateral. The credit score you need to get a personal loan will depend on the lender. Commonly, you\u2019ll need a credit score of at least 670 to be considered creditworthy to get a personal loan with a reasonable interest rate. Personal loan lenders will look at your credit score and credit history when you apply for a loan, but you don\u2019t need to make a down payment. Most personal loans do not require collateral. When you apply for a personal loan, your lender will check your credit with a hard credit check. This can temporarily reduce your credit score, but this effect will disappear as you pay back the loan. If you pay it back on time, then your credit score will likely eventually improve. You can use a personal loan to buy a car, but this typically only makes sense in specific circumstances. Auto loans tend to have lower interest rates than personal loans and longer repayment periods. However, a personal loan might be a good option if you are buying a car from a private seller.

            "content": "Veterans can apply for personal loans from banks, credit unions, and online lenders Matt Webber is an experienced personal finance writer, researcher, and editor. He has published widely on personal finance, marketing, and the impact of technology on contemporary arts and culture. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol A \u201cveteran personal loan\u201d is a personal loan taken out by a veteran, although banks typically don't offer a personal loan exclusive to veterans. Many of the best personal loans are just as good a deal for veterans as they are for those who haven\u2019t served in the military. However, some credit unions are only open to veterans, and they may offer good personal loan rates. In this article, we\u2019ll look in more detail at personal loan options for veterans and how to compare different personal loans. Veteran personal loans are essentially personal loans taken out by veterans. A personal loan is a loan you can borrow to use for a nearly any purpose. For instance, you may use a personal loan to consolidate debt, finance home renovations, or pay for a wedding. You can get a personal loan from financial institutions like banks, credit unions, or online lenders. The money you borrow will be provided in a lump sum and must be repaid over time with interest. Some lenders may also charge fees. If you're currently serving in the military, you're covered by the Military Lending Act (MLA). This limits the interest rates that may be charged on many types of consumer loans to no more than 36% and provides other important protections. It covers payday loans, overdraft interest, and personal loans. These limits only apply to people on active duty, not veterans. Veterans have essentially the same access to personal loans as non-veterans. As such, veterans can get a personal loan from any of three main sources: banks, credit unions, or online lenders. Veteran personal loans are not the same as VA loan, which are mortgages specifically for veterans. VA loans are available through a program established by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) (previously the Veterans Administration). With VA loans, veterans, service members, and their surviving spouses can purchase homes with little to no down payment and no private mortgage insurance. They generally get a competitive interest rate. With this type of loan, the VA sets the qualifying and lending standards, but it doesn\u2019t actually provide the loan. Rather, private lenders (such as banks and credit unions) administer the loan. This type of loan is available to active service members, veterans, and their spouses. However, it can only be used to buy property. Veterans looking for a loan for any other reason than buying a home cannot use a VA loan. Qualifying for a personal loan, whether as a veteran or not, is generally only dependent on your credit score and income level. Personal loans are typically unsecured. This means that you're not required to put up collateral for the loan, so you don't risk losing your property if you fail to make payments. When you apply for a personal loan, you can generally get \u201cpre-qualified\u201d for a loan for a specific amount. Your lender will perform a \u201csoft\u201d credit check, which won\u2019t affect your credit score. When you finalize the loan, your lender will then perform a \u201chard\u201d credit check to ensure you can repay it. This can impact your credit score, but it will recover as you pay back the loan. Our personal loan calculator can help you compare the costs of personal loans, whether they're from a bank or another source. The cost of a personal loan will vary depending on your lender and your loan terms. So, it\u2019s important to shop around and understand the cost of a loan before you accept it. Look for a loan with a low interest rate, a payment term that fits your financial circumstances, and low fees. Typically, a loan from a bank or a credit union will be the best option. Some credit unions cater specifically to veterans and may be able to offer you a better deal than you\u2019d find on the open market. They're also more likely to understand your circumstances, and they might be more willing to work with you if you have bad credit than a bank would. In general, the cost of a loan is determined by three main factors: The first step in getting a veteran personal loan is to shop around for the best deal. Once you\u2019ve found a loan that makes financial sense for you, the process of applying for a personal loan differs slightly between the three main types of provider: If you need your loan quickly, online lenders can be more convenient. Some online lenders can approve your application and send you money almost instantly (or within a few days). However, they tend to charge higher interest rates than either banks or credit unions. Veterans can get personal loans, though personal loans specifically for veterans aren't common. Veterans may find a credit union that caters to veterans that provides competitive personal loan rates. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers a number of mortgages that are only available to veterans. These loans are focused on making it easier for veterans to buy real estate.\u00a0Beyond that, veterans are welcome to apply for home equity loans, auto loans, and personal loans from any lender. Lenders tend to charge lower rates for VA loans than they do on conventional mortgages, but these loans can only be used for buying real estate. When it comes to personal loans, veterans tend to get similar rates as those who haven\u2019t served. Veterans can apply for personal loans from banks, credit unions, and online lenders. The best personal loans for veterans are generally the same as the best personal loans for non-veterans, which are loans with low interest rates, a suitable repayment term, and low fees. Consider consulting with a professional financial advisor for guidance on which personal loan will best suit your needs.

            "title": "What Are Personal Loan Eligibility Requirements?",
            "content": "Jodi Jacobson / Getty Images Personal loans can be used for many different purposes. Lenders, including banks, credit unions, and online lenders, offer personal loans. But before you start planning how you will use those funds, you will need to meet lender eligibility criteria. Learn how factors like your credit score, debt, and collateral can affect whether you qualify for a personal loan. Lenders consider your credit score and credit history when determining whether to offer you a personal loan. Your FICO credit score is a number from 300 to 850. The higher your credit score, the more likely you will be approved for a personal loan because you will be viewed as a lower-risk borrower. Credit bureaus calculate credit scores using the information on your credit report. Your credit report includes information on your credit activity, such as how many credit accounts you have, your debt level, your credit mix, and your payment history. It also includes whether you have recently applied for new credit. Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion are the three main credit bureaus. You are entitled to one free credit report from them each year, which you can get through AnnualCreditReport.com. You may have slightly different credit scores with each credit bureau because they calculate them in slightly different ways (using proprietary formulas), but the main factors that impact your score are roughly: You need to demonstrate a reliable source of income because lenders want to know that you will be able to repay what you borrow. Minimum income requirements vary depending on the lender. You generally need more than enough income to cover your current debt and new obligations. Your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, one of the common five loan requirements of a bank, is calculated as a percentage. It measures your total monthly debt load compared to your monthly income. A low DTI makes you more attractive to lenders because it indicates you have more available income to repay a personal loan. For personal loans, it is recommended to have a debt-to-income ratio of less than 36% to improve your chances of being approved for a loan at cost-effective rates\u2014although, in rare cases, lenders may consider a DTI up to 40%. Most personal loans will be unsecured, which means you will not need to provide collateral to be approved. However, bad credit may prevent you from qualifying for an unsecured personal loan. However, you may be able to qualify for a secured personal loan. If you apply for a secured personal loan, you will need to provide collateral to back the loan. Collateral can be a physical asset, such as your vehicle, or a cash deposit. When you apply for a personal loan, you must pay an origination fee. Lenders charge this one-time fee for loan execution, which is calculated as a percentage of the total loan amount. Origination fees vary by lender, ranging from 1% to 6%. You may be able to pay the origination fee upfront, or it can be deducted from the total amount you are borrowing. Lenders may also consider your age when you apply for a personal loan. Many lenders will not approve loans for borrowers under age 18. When you are ready to apply for a personal loan, you will need to gather the necessary documents so you can fill out a loan application. The application process can be slightly different with each lender, but you'll usually be asked to share personal and financial information that will help the lender determine if you are a good candidate for a loan. You may be able to fill out an online application for some lenders. If you want to get a personal loan from a bank, you may have to complete your application in person. Other documents you will usually need with your application include: To get approved for a loan, you can take several steps to improve your financial situation so you meet a lender's criteria. Here are some key ways to increase your chances of being approved: If you are denied for a personal loan, you will receive an adverse action notice. This notice will explain why your application was rejected. Once you know why you were denied, you can take steps to prepare yourself to reapply successfully. They include: The amount of time it takes to get a personal loan will depend on the individual lender and its process. Typically, you can expect the process to take less than a week. Some lenders provide same-day funding after approving a personal loan. If you do not meet a lender's specific eligibility requirements, you will not be able to get a personal loan with that lender. Lenders may deny a personal loan application if your credit score is too low, your debt load is too high, or your income is not high enough to repay the loan. Personal loans are usually unsecured, which means you do not have to provide collateral. If you are applying for a secured personal loan, you will need to supply an asset to be used as collateral. The amount you can borrow with a personal loan will vary depending on the lender. In most cases, the largest personal loan you will be able to take out is $100,000. You may be able to borrow as little as a few hundred dollars with a personal loan. The minimum required amount will depend on the lender. Determine if a personal loan is your best option before applying by ensuring you meet the lender's eligibility requirements. You can use a personal loan calculator to get an idea of what your monthly payments and the total cost of the loan will look like. If a personal loan is the right fit for you, you can compare offers to find the best personal loan with a rate and terms that work for you.

Xavierarnau / Getty Images While the federal government does not specifically offer personal loans, it does offer or guarantee other loans for specific purposes. These include loans for education, housing, or building a small business. Learn how you will need to meet eligibility requirements to qualify for these government loans and more about the loan types that the federal government offers. The federal government does not offer personal loans that borrowers could use for any reason, such as to consolidate credit card debt, buy a car, or pay for a wedding. Instead, the U.S. government offers or guarantees loans for a specific purpose like paying for education, buying housing, or starting a business. Although not a traditional personal loan, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides installment payment plans for those not able to pay their tax obligations in full by the due date. IRS installment loans include setup fees, interest charges, and penalties. Also, while some loans are made directly, the federal government doesn\u2019t fund every type of government loan. Instead, it guarantees loans that are funded by private lenders. Numerous government loans are available for various purposes, including student loans and mortgages. Let\u2019s look in more detail at the types of loans that the government provides. The federal government offers both subsidized and unsubsidized loans to help students and parents pay for tuition at two- and four-year colleges and universities, community colleges, and trade and technical schools. With subsidized loans, a third party pays the interest on the loan for a set period of time. With unsubsidized loans, the borrower pays the interest on the loan for the life of the loan. Government loans for education include: Most universities and schools use the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to award federal aid along with state- and college-funded student aid. A student may want to consider a personal loan if they've exhausted all of their financial aid options and other sources of funding. The U.S. government offers several mortgages to help borrowers buy a home or improve the home they own. These include: If you\u2019re shopping for a mortgage, review the eligibility requirements to see which loan is the best fit for your financial needs. For example, if you are a military veteran, you would likely qualify for a VA loan with more favorable terms than an FHA loan. To help farmers and ranchers, the U.S. government offers loans to purchase or expand a farm or ranch and improve facilities. There are also loans to help those operating fishing vessels or fisheries facilities. Agriculture loans include: Agricultural loans also may have loan requirements based on your agricultural experience, the location of the property, and the commodities involved. The federal government has loans for borrowers looking to start, buy, improve, or expand a business. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans are for all businesses, from small to midsize to large conglomerates. They include: The primary difference between federal and private loans is that federal loans are backed or provided by the U.S. government, while private loans are provided by private lenders such as banks and credit unions. But there are other differences as well. With federal loans, you may find it easier to get approved due to lower credit score requirements, if any. You also typically pay a lower or no down payment and can receive lower interest rates. Other benefits could include deferred payment options and no prepayment penalties. However, due to their qualification requirements, federal loans may not be as easy to get as private loans. When considering a government loan, it\u2019s important to determine if a federal loan meets your needs for financial assistance. Do you need a loan for education, business, or housing? If not, then a government loan may not be the right choice. If a government loan could be the right choice, you will need to review the qualification requirements to see if you meet them. This could range from credit score to income level to location and other requirements specific to the loan. You can use the U.S. government\u2019s Loan Finder tool to check if there is a government loan that is right for you. Although the government doesn\u2019t offer unsecured personal loans for needs such as buying a car or paying for a wedding, the government does provide loans to help pay for education, buy housing, or start a business. While there are some standard requirements for certain personal loans, many banks have their own requirements as well. It\u2019s important to shop around to find a personal loan that you can qualify for without jumping through a lot of hoops. The easiest government loan to get depends on the type of loan needed. Each government loan comes with its own list of requirements for approval. Credit score requirements vary by government loan. Some don\u2019t require a credit check, so your credit score won\u2019t matter. Others have varying minimum credit score requirements. While the federal government doesn\u2019t offer personal loans, it does offer a variety of loans for specific purposes. If you need financial assistance to pay for education, housing, a small business, or other needs, then a government loan could be the right choice. You would need to meet all eligibility requirements. If you do, you could get a loan with favorable terms, such as low interest rates and flexible repayment terms.

            "title": "What Are Hardship Personal Loans?",
            "content": "Matt Webber is an experienced personal finance writer, researcher, and editor. He has published widely on personal finance, marketing, and the impact of technology on contemporary arts and culture. Investopedia / Mira Norian Hardship personal loans are designed for borrowers facing financial difficulties. Here is how they work, along with some other alternatives\u00a0worth exploring. The exact definition of a hardship loan can vary from one lender to another. Typically, hardship loans are similar to personal loans, but they tend to have low loan limits, relatively low interest rates, and short repayment terms because they are designed to get you out of immediate financial trouble. Smaller banks and credit unions are more likely to offer a hardship loan, and you'll generally have to prove that you are facing genuine financial difficulties to access them. If you're approved, you can use a hardship loan for a variety of purposes, such as to meet obligations like medical bills, to make other loan payments, or simply to pay everyday living expenses. Hardship loans work much like other types of personal loans. You'll apply for the loan, usually online. If your application is approved, the lender will send you money in a lump sum, typically within a few days. You then have to repay that money, typically in equal monthly installments, over several months or several years. In addition, you'll pay interest on the loan and sometimes fees. Hardship personal loans differ from other types of personal loans in several ways. First, you'll usually have to prove you are in genuine financial trouble to qualify. The maximum amount you can borrow will likely be lower, and you'll have to repay the loan fairly quickly. Your interest rate may be lower for a hardship personal loan than you would get on a regular personal loan. In 2023, Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use such loans in the future. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvements and large purchases. Hardships were not high on the list, although medical bills, which came in fourth, probably qualified in some instances. There are two basic types of hardship personal loans: Unsecured personal loans are those that aren't backed by any collateral. This means that your lender can't repossess your assets if you fail to pay back the loan, but also that the lender is taking a larger risk on you. For that reason, you'll typically need a higher\u00a0credit score\u00a0or have to pay a higher interest rate in order to get an unsecured hardship loan. Secured hardship personal loans, in contrast, are those that are backed by collateral. This makes them less risky for lenders, who can then offer them to customers with bad credit or give customers with good credit a lower interest rate. If you can't qualify for an unsecured personal loan, a secured hardship loan could be a good option. Compare the rates offered by the best lenders to see which is best for you. As with any financial product, hardship personal loans have both benefits and downsides to consider. Fast funding Flexible use Qualification can be difficult Less flexible repayment terms Low maximum loan amounts Higher interest rates Although hardship personal loans might seem like the logical choice in an emergency, you could find another solution that works better for your financial situation. Among the possibilities: A hardship withdrawal is an emergency distribution from a tax-advantaged retirement plan. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) permits these withdrawals in the event of \"an immediate and heavy financial need.\" This type of special distribution may be possible from plans such as an individual retirement account (IRA) or a 401(k), provided that it meets certain criteria. In the case of workplace plans, employers aren't required to allow hardship withdrawals, and it is up to your employer to determine whether you qualify. A hardship withdrawal will still be subject to standard income tax and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty for withdrawals made before age 59\u00bd in some instances. Bear in mind that if you take a hardship withdrawal from your retirement account, you will miss out on the interest that this money would have accrued had you left it in. So, it's worth thinking carefully about whether this type of withdrawal makes sense for you. Regular payday loans tend to have extremely high interest rates and are illegal in some states because they are regarded as predatory lending. However, some credit unions and online lenders offer payday alternative loans (sometimes known as PALs) that are generally less expensive. Payday alternative loans can be used to cover unexpected bills and are available to borrowers with bad credit. They are typically for $200 to $1,000, with repayment terms of one to six months. Payday alternative loans may come with a small application fee. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending enables individuals to obtain loans directly from other individuals via one of the various online platforms established for that purpose. If you face financial difficulties and find it hard to qualify for other types of loans, P2P lending might be a good option. These loans tend to have less strict qualification requirements than standard personal loans and can also have relatively low interest rates. However, maximum loan amounts can be low, so they may not entirely cover an expensive emergency. Other options to consider include: The steps for obtaining a hardship personal loan are similar to those for a traditional personal loan, with a few key differences. Here's the basic process. You do have to pay back a hardship loan, plus the interest it has accrued. You'll usually receive the money from a hardship personal loan within a few days of being approved for the loan. If you are making a hardship withdrawal from your 401(k), it can take two to three days for the money to become available. To get a hardship loan, you'll typically have to prove that you are in financial difficulty. You'll also have to meet the lender's specific requirements, which can include a credit score over a certain number. If you fail to make payments on any secured personal loan, the lender can seize and sell your collateral. Online research can be a good place to start. You can also review Investopedia's recommended list of the best emergency loans for bad credit to learn more. A hardship personal loan could help you ride out a financial storm. These loans are generally offered by smaller banks and credit unions and tend to have lower interest rates, lower maximum loan amounts, and shorter repayment periods than a standard personal loan. If you are facing a hardship, it's also worth looking into IRA or 401(k) hardship withdrawals, a home equity loan or HELOC, and any government or nonprofit grant programs for which you might be eligible.

She worked for almost two decades as an executive, leading multi-billion dollar mortgage, credit card, and savings portfolios with operations worldwide and a unique focus on the consumer. Her mortgage expertise was honed post-2008 crisis as she implemented the significant changes resulting from Dodd-Frank required regulations. Shapecharge / Getty Images It\u2019s possible to get a personal loan for $500 or even less, but it can be difficult. Most banks, credit unions, or online lenders don\u2019t offer loans this small because the cost of administering the loan would be greater than the profit they would make. For this reason, most banks and credit unions don\u2019t offer personal loans for less than $1,000. However, you can get a loan for $500 in a number of ways. These options include payday loans and loans through loan apps. Some of these loans have other benefits. You can receive them fairly quickly, and they may not require a credit check. However, they may also have much higher interest rates than the personal loans offered through traditional lenders. If you\u2019re looking for a personal loan, the best option may be to apply with a financial institution like a bank or a credit union. A reputable financial institution often offers low interest rates, low fees, and flexible repayment options. You can typically apply online or in person if the bank has branch locations. However, the smallest loan you can apply for at many lenders will likely be about $1,000 or more, and you\u2019ll need a minimum credit score to qualify. Minimum credit scores will vary by lender. After you apply for a personal loan, a lender assesses your credit risk to determine if you qualify for the loan. They will consider your credit score, income, and other financial factors. If you\u2019re approved, you receive the money in a lump sum and repay it over time plus interest in monthly payments. While most banks, credit unions, and online lenders don\u2019t offer personal loans for less than $1,000, some do. Among them: First Tech Federal Credit Union, which offers personal loans from $500, and Navy Federal Credit Union, which offers personal loans from $250. First Tech Federal Credit Union and Navy Federal Credit Union offer interest rates from about 8.14% to 18%, depending on your credit score. So, their loans are likely to be much less expensive than payday loans, cash advances, or loan app loans. If a $500 personal loan doesn\u2019t make sense for you, or if you can\u2019t qualify, you can consider other small loan options, such as a cash advance, funding through a loan app, or a payday loan. However, these loans have downsides to consider, like higher interest rates. A cash advance is a short-term loan from a bank or an alternative lender. The term also refers to a service many credit card issuers provide, allowing cardholders to withdraw a certain amount of cash against their available credit. Cash advances generally have high interest rates and fees, but they may be attractive to borrowers because they have fast approval and funding. It may be a useful financial tool if you can repay a cash advance loan quickly. Be aware that a cash advance loan can indirectly hurt your credit score by increasing your outstanding balance and your credit utilization ratio. Many loan apps now offer small loans, some for as little as $5. These apps also allow you access to your loan quickly (typically within one to three days), and many don\u2019t require a credit check. Here are some examples of loan apps offering small personal loans: Using apps like these can provide emergency funds. However, they generally charge monthly fees in lieu of interest, which can make borrowing small sums relatively expensive. For this reason, using funds from loan apps is not a sustainable, long-term solution to financial difficulties. A payday loan is a type of short-term borrowing where a lender will extend high-interest credit based on your income. Its principal is typically a portion of your next paycheck. Payday loans charge high interest rates for short-term, immediate credit. They are also called cash advance loans or check advance loans. Payday loans can also be useful in an emergency, such as to pay for vehicle repairs or medical bills. However, they also have high interest rates and may have high penalties if you fail to pay them back on time. Payday loans aren\u2019t considered a good solution to financial difficulties and aren\u2019t legal in all states. If you\u2019re applying for a personal loan of any amount, you should consider a number of factors: The process of getting a $500 loan is the same as applying for any other type of personal loan. Here are the main steps: Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, to Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. Many lenders will require a credit score of at least 580, but some don\u2019t require a credit check. The minimum score varies by lender, and the higher your credit score, the more likely you are to qualify for a loan. The smallest loan you can get from a bank is usually $1,000, although you may find loans for lower amounts. For example, Navy Federal Credit Union offers personal loans for as little as $250. The easiest loans to get are those that require no credit check, such as those from loan apps and some online lenders. However, these loans tend to have high interest rates that will increase the total cost of the loan. The minimum amount for a personal loan is generally around $1,000. You may find loans of lower amounts through lenders such as loan apps, payday loan providers, and cash advances on your credit card. However, these lenders tend to charge higher interest rates than you would find on a personal loan. Consider checking with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for educational resources on small personal loans or consulting with a free financial professional who may be available through your local financial institution to help you determine which loan may be best for your needs.

            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Thomas Barwick / GettyImages Personal loans offer the predictability of fixed interest rates, fixed monthly payments, and a set repayment plan, which is why many consumers choose them over credit cards and lines of credit. If you're looking for loans you can pay back monthly, it's crucial to make your payments on time and confirm that these payments will fit within your budget before you borrow. Read on to learn how personal loans work, how to manage them, and some alternatives to consider. A personal loan is a type of loan that's typically unsecured, although secured personal loans also exist. Either way, personal loans let consumers borrow money and pay it back on a monthly basis. The loan funds are given as a lump sum of cash upfront. Personal loans also come with fixed interest rates, and they include a set repayment period that won't change. This means these loans also offer fixed monthly payments that stay the same throughout the life of the loan. Because payment history makes up the largest individual component of your credit score, the most important aspect of managing a personal loan is making sure all monthly payments are made early or on time. While on-time payments can help you build credit and improve your score over time, late payments can have a dramatic negative impact on your credit score that takes months or years to overcome. Other steps involved in properly managing a personal loan include making sure loan payments fit into a monthly budget or spending plan, in addition to avoiding the temptation to over-borrow just because you can. Most personal loans last from one to seven years, although you can typically pay these loans off early without any prepayment penalties. With that in mind, it can help to make extra payments toward a personal loan if you can afford to and doing so won't hold you back from achieving other financial goals. Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, to Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. If you're thinking of getting a personal loan but are also wondering about other financing options, consider these alternatives: Personal loan options can be accessed online from the comfort of your home. They're also available at brick and mortar banks and credit unions. Steps involved in applying include checking your credit score, calculating your borrowing amount and monthly payment, comparing loan companies, and filling out the loan application. The best personal loans are geared toward individuals with high incomes and those with good or excellent credit scores, which is why you'll want to know where you stand before you apply. Fortunately, there are many places where you can check your credit score for free, including Credit Karma, Credit Sesame, Capital One's CreditWise service, and more. Look at the top personal loan companies and what they have to offer in terms of loan amounts, interest rates, and fees. Make sure to keep an eye out for hidden fees that these companies may charge as well, including administrative fees or origination fees. Some lenders let you \"check your rate\" and get pre-qualified online. This step only requires you to submit some basic information about yourself like your name, address, and last four digits of your Social Security number (SSN). From there, you can find out the rate you might pay and how much you may be eligible to borrow. Once you find a loan offer you're happy with, the following steps can help you apply for a personal loan: As you can see in the chart above, different lenders offer different term lengths that borrowers can choose from when they apply. For example, it's possible to borrow money and pay it back over 12 monthly payments if you want to pay down debt fast. Meanwhile, personal loans with low monthly payments can sometimes last up to 84 months or even longer. Ideally, you'll find a personal loan with a repayment term, interest rate, and monthly payment that fits with your lifestyle and your budget. It's worth keeping in mind that loans with high interest rates can be considerably more expensive over time\u2014particularly if they come with a long repayment term. As an example, a $15,000 loan with an annual percentage rate (APR) of 21% and a repayment term of 12 months requires a monthly payment of $1,396.71 and total interest charges of $1,760.48. If you pay the same loan amount off over 60 months at the same rate, however, you'll pay just $405.80 per month, but you'll also fork over total interest charges of $9,348.02 by the end of that period. The additional interest charges that add up when you borrow money over a longer timeline can be avoided by choosing a shorter repayment period to begin with. However, personal loans that last 12 to 36 months come with much higher monthly payments than those that last 60 to 84 months, and it can be difficult to commit to a larger payment, even for just 12 to 36 months. With that in mind, it's important to make sure you can pay your loan off early without any prepayment penalties. Doing so gives you the flexibility to pay more than the required minimum payment on the loan when you can afford to, without committing to a higher payment for the long haul. In the example above of a $15,000 loan at 21% APR with a 60-year term, we mentioned how total interest charges over that time add up to $9,348.02. If you opted to pay an extra $200 toward this loan each month instead of only the $405.80 required minimum payment, the loan's term would be shortened by two years and three months and you would save $4,514.74 in interest along the way. Personal loans offer a way to borrow money without collateral in most cases. They also come with set monthly payments, fixed rates, and a fixed repayment schedule that lets you know exactly when you'll make your last loan payment. This makes them a good option for people who want to borrow a specific amount of money for a set time period and make fixed monthly payments without any surprises. Personal loans are also called installment loans, as you pay back the money with fixed monthly installments. However, not all installment loans are personal loans. This term can also apply to any loan that makes fixed monthly payments, such as a mortgage or auto loan. Personal loan rates are high for people with imperfect credit or a limited credit history. If you want to qualify for a lower interest rate or better loan terms, it can help if you improve your credit score before applying.Additionally, most personal loans are unsecured, or don't require any collateral. An unsecured loan is typically more expensive since it exposes the lender to risk in the event that you default. The higher rate helps reduce their exposure to loss. Personal loans typically come with repayment terms that last from 12 to 84 months, although some lenders let borrowers pay back the money over shorter or longer timelines. Personal loans are loans that you pay monthly that let you access cash when you need it. Provided you borrow only as much as you need and always make payments on-time, these loans can help you learn positive financial habits while improving your credit score over time. Before you apply for a personal loan, you'll want to compare lenders based on loan amounts, rates, and fees. Doing so can help you identify lenders that offer loans with the best rates and terms, which can help you save money over time.

There are more ways to pay for college that are more favorable for borrowers than a personal loan. While personal loans for students might be an option, they're not necessarily the best option for most people. The cost of a college education is continuing to rise. For some potential students, using a personal loan to pay for school might be the determining factor between attending and leaving college behind. Some lenders restrict using a personal loan to pay for tuition and related costs. But you might be able to use a personal loan to pay for other school costs that aren\u2019t directly tied to tuition. For instance, you might be able to pay for supplies (like a computer or desk), transportation (like bus fare to and from campus), or child care (like daycare or a babysitter). But personal loans don\u2019t offer the same benefits or protections as student loans\u2014both federal and private. Personal loans require repayment right away, while most student loans offer a grace period while you\u2019re still in school. A personal loan should be one of your last options to pay for school-related expenses, and you should exhaust all other funding choices first. There are several different ways to pay for school and some require more work on the front end, while others require more work on the back end. There are a few different places to get a personal loan for school, including: Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, to Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. Personal loans might be one way to pay for school-related costs, but it should be considered after you\u2019ve exhausted all other options, including scholarships and grants, federal student loans, and private student loans. The more free money you can get through scholarships and grants, the less you\u2019ll need to borrow from other sources, including student loans and personal loans. When you complete your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), you may qualify for federal scholarships and grants, but you'll also receive federal student loan offers. These loans tend to have the lowest interest rates, longest repayment terms, favorable repayment options, and the possibility of student debt forgiveness. If you need to borrow money for school, this should be your first choice. These types of loans come from private lenders, like banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Federal student loans come from the United States Department of Education. You can take out a private student loan any time throughout the year if you need to. So if there are still funding gaps, you can apply for a private student loan. Like personal loans, these require a hard credit check. If you lack a sufficient credit history to stand on your own, you may need a co-signer for a private student loan. Many private student loan lenders offer some benefits that personal loans don't, including longer repayment terms and a six-month grace period after you leave school. The average student loan borrower in the U.S. owed $37,645.16 as of Q3'23. There\u2019s a chance you could pay off a student loan with a personal loan, but it depends on the lender and their requirements. Many personal loan lenders restrict how you can use your loan when it comes to education expenses. Some lenders allow you to pay off your student loans with a personal loan. However, personal loan interest rates are usually higher than student loan rates, while their repayment terms are typically shorter. So going this route could end up costing you more in the long run. Some lenders in the U.S. provide personal loans to international students and residents, but not many. You\u2019ll need to see if the lender offers this option, and if so, what the requirements are, since those vary by lender. Applying for a personal loan doesn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll get approved for one. If you don\u2019t pay your student loans, you could end up defaulting on them. Depending on where you live, your lender could garnish your wages or tax refund to pay back some or all of your outstanding loans. Your credit score will plummet, hurting your chances of borrowing anything in the future, whether that\u2019s an auto loan, a mortgage, or even a credit card. A personal loan can be a useful tool to help you pay for a higher education, particularly in regards to college-adjacent expenses. However, in most cases, you'll likely be better off trying to secure funding from more traditional sources, specifically scholarships, grants, and student loans. After you've exhausted all of your other options, then a personal loan could be a good option for filling in any remaining gaps.

            "content": "Learn where and how to get a $35,000 personal loan skynesher / GettyImages Personal loans for $35,000 are definitely available, yet they may come with higher interest rates or annual percentage yield (APY) and steeper eligibility requirements than smaller loans. To qualify for a $35,000 personal loan, you'll need to ensure you have a good credit score and earn enough income to be able to afford the monthly payment. If you need to borrow $35,000 and you're wondering whether a personal loan could work for your needs, consider the interest rate and monthly payment amount. Some lenders offer loan terms as long as 84 months or seven years, which can lower your monthly payment. However, the longer term can also increase the total interest cost over the life of the loan. Discover seven lenders that offer personal loans for $35,000. Personal loans remain popular among borrowers since they offer several benefits, including a fixed interest rate, fixed monthly payment, and a set repayment plan. Another advantage of personal loans is that borrowers can get a lump sum of cash instead of a line of credit to borrow against, providing flexibility as to how to use their loan funds. If you're hoping to borrow $35,000 from a personal loan company, you should know that most\u00a0prominent lenders offer loans in this amount and even higher. The table below shows several lenders that offer personal loans of $35,000 or more, their current personal loan interest rates, and loan terms. Getting a $35,000 personal loan involves several different steps, and you'll want to complete them in the right order. Here's everything you need to do to prepare for and ultimately qualify for financing. Before you apply for a personal loan, you should know that some lenders have steeper credit requirements than others. You should also check your credit score to see where you stand, keeping in mind that you'll have fewer loan options if your credit score is fair (FICO scores from 580 to 669) or below, compared to the options you'll have if you have with a good credit score (FICO scores of 670 to 739) or better. Fortunately, there are plenty of sources for free credit scores, including Credit Karma, Credit Sesame, Capital One's CreditWise service, and more. Next up, you'll want to compare lenders based on their advertised interest rates, loan amounts, and repayment terms. You can also use a personal loan calculator to determine how much your monthly payment might be based on the average advertised rates. Also, be sure to check for fees that personal loan companies would charge you as part of your comparison. For example, some personal loan companies like Upstart charge origination fees that can be for up to 12% of the loan amount, whereas others don't charge origination fees or other hidden fees. Some personal loan companies let you get pre-qualified online without a hard inquiry on your credit reports. This step can help you figure out the interest rate you would likely pay if you got the loan, the amount you can probably qualify for, and the repayment terms of a $35,000 personal loan. In most cases, you'll be required to share the following information in order to pre-qualify for a personal loan online: Once you know your $35,000 personal loan payment, you can figure out whether you can truly afford to borrow money. Get out your last few months of bank statements, credit card bills, and pay stubs to figure out how much money you bring in and how you're spending it most months. Ideally, you'll be earning enough income to cover your regular expenses, discretionary expenses, and new personal loan payment while also having money left over to save each month. Read over the details of loans you're considering, and spend some time digging into all the fine print. The most important details to know are the amount you're borrowing, the total costs of borrowing, your loan's interest rate, the monthly payment, any fees that apply, and whether the loan has a prepayment penalty. Once you're ready to apply for financing, you can complete the personal loan application from the comfort of your home. Information you'll need to supply in the application will include your name, address, phone number, employment information, SSN, and income. You may need to supply other documentation to get your loan approved, including pay stubs, tax returns, a driver's license, and more. How much a $35,000 personal loan will cost in the long run depends on the loans' interest rate and repayment term. Once you know your loan's interest rate and term length, you can find your own monthly payment using a personal loan calculator. The chart below show the average $35,000 personal loan payment in a range of scenarios: The credit score required for a $35,000 personal loan varies widely by lender. Getting pre-qualified online is an excellent way to find out if your credit is good enough without submitting an actual loan application. A $35,000 personal loan is pretty substantial, yet some personal loan companies let consumers borrow up to $100,000. The monthly payment on a $35,000 personal loan varies based on the interest rate and repayment term. For example, qualifying for 7.99% APR for 24 months on a $35,000 loan would leave you paying $1,582.80 per month for two years. Meanwhile, paying 29.99% APR for 60 months with the same loan amount would mean paying $1,132.15 per month for five years. Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, and Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. If you need to borrow $35,000 for home improvements, debt consolidation, a wedding, or almost any other reason, a personal loan could be a good fit. This is especially true if you have good credit and a strong income, as these factors can help you qualify for funding with the best rates and terms. Keep in mind that you can build in some flexibility in your monthly payments if you plan to borrow $35,000 or more. For example, you can get a lower monthly payment by choosing a longer repayment timeline or by improving your credit to qualify for a lower interest rate.

            "content": "ferrantraite / GettyImages A $5,000 personal loan, with a fixed interest rate and a fixed monthly payment, can help you finance various purchases and expenses, such as debt consolidation, an emergency car repair, a home improvement project, or even a vacation. You'll have to pay back the money over a set timeline you agree to ahead of time. While you can use the funds from a $5,000 personal loan for a variety of needs, some of the best uses for this money include: That said, there are some expenses you shouldn't (or won't be able to) cover with a $5,000 personal loan. For example, lenders usually won't let you take out a personal loan to pay for college expenses or pay off student loans, and you typically can't use a loan to fund a down payment on a home. Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, and Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. Approval requirements for a $5,000 personal loan vary from lender to lender. In fact, some personal loan companies offer loans only to those with strong credit profiles and incomes, whereas others offer personal loans for fair credit or even bad credit. Personal loan companies consider the following factors for approval: As shown in the chart below, many of the best personal loans have a minimum borrowing requirement of $5,000 or less. These companies still have their own eligibility requirements, so do your research to ensure one of the better options will be something you can qualify for before applying. Because so many personal loan companies let you compare options and apply online, getting funding is easier than ever. The following steps can help you apply for and receive a personal loan for $5,000 or more. The cost of $5,000 personal loan payments will vary based on the interest rate you qualify for and how long you want to be paying your loan off. You can use a personal loan calculator to see how much you'll need to pay each month based on your desired loan terms. The chart below shows the monthly payment for a $5,000 personal loan based on several interest rates and repayment timelines. You will almost certainly have no problems qualifying for a $5,000 personal loan if you have a substantial income and good credit. However, you may struggle to get approved if your income is inconsistent, you have a low credit score, or you already have considerable debt. Some lenders don't have a minimum credit score, whereas others require a minimum credit score of 580 or 660. The most personal loan companies will typically lend at one time is $100,000. You may or may not be able to qualify for a loan amount this high based on your income, credit score, and other factors. Because personal loans come with fixed interest rates and set monthly payments, they offer a convenient and predictable way to borrow the money you need. Further, most personal loan companies offer loans for $5,000, with many letting you borrow less or significantly more than that.

Her mortgage expertise was honed post-2008 crisis as she implemented the significant changes resulting from Dodd-Frank required regulations. South_agency / GettyImages Borrowing money to pay down debt or for emergencies can be a big break for those who need it. But then it comes time to start repaying your personal loan. Fortunately, you might be able to pay off your loan faster by using a calculator to set or estimate new payments. A personal loan amortization calculator is a tool that helps you estimate how much your monthly payments will be based on how much you borrow, your loan terms, and your interest rate (which itself is determined by your lender, based on your credit score and other possible factors). If you haven\u2019t taken out a personal loan yet, you can use a calculator to input different variables and get a sense of which terms and rates work best for you. Since you\u2019ll need to account for a new loan payment in your budget, it\u2019s a good idea to see how much you can afford before submitting a loan application. For instance, if you need to borrow $9,000 at a 7% interest rate, your repayment terms will determine your monthly payment. For a three-year term, monthly payments will be $277.89. Meanwhile, for a five-year term, it\u2019ll be $178.21 a month. Longer repayment terms mean you\u2019ll pay more in interest over the total life of your loan. In the example above, you\u2019ll pay $1,692.65 in interest after paying off your loan in five years. But if you pay it off in three years, you can expect to pay around $1,004.18. That\u2019s a $688 difference if you pay off your loan two years earlier. Monthly personal loan payments are broken down into a few different parts, including: When you make monthly payments, it\u2019ll include a portion of your principal balance, the interest, and fees, if applicable. Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, to Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. Keep tabs on all the moving parts of your personal loan, like: You can pay off your personal loan faster by making larger monthly payments than the minimum amount required. You might be able to set up an autopay amount so you don\u2019t have to manually make larger payments each month. You can also make extra payments on your principal balance, which would ultimately reduce the amount you'll pay in interest over the life of the loan. You can make one-off payments on your loan throughout the year as long as you continue to make the minimum monthly payment when required. Be sure to notify your lender if you want these extra payments to be made specifically toward the principal, otherwise they may simply be considered a partial payment for the subsequent month. Unless your lender charges a prepayment penalty, closing an account early doesn\u2019t ordinarily have a drastic impact on your credit score. Most personal loan lenders don\u2019t have prepayment penalties and usually encourage borrowers to pay off loans early, if possible. In most cases, any time you close an account, your credit score will go down. For some people, that decrease could be minimal, while others could see a much larger drop. Closing a personal loan account also impacts the age of your credit history. The longer you have active accounts, the better you look to potential borrowers or credit issuers in the future because it shows them you\u2019re responsible with credit. Overall, it's still generally better to not have the debt, and in most cases, your score will rebound after a few months of regular, on-time payments to other loans or revolving lines of credit, such as a credit card. Taking on more debt through a personal loan can feel like a financial burden. So, making a plan to pay off your personal loan faster is one way to relieve that feeling sooner. You can use a personal loan calculator to estimate potential monthly payments based on your loan amount, interest rate, and current payment schedule. If you\u2019re thinking about taking out a personal loan, a calculator will help you determine what your monthly payments could be based on an estimated interest rate and repayment terms. Toggle between different loan terms and interest rates to see what your payments would look like. That way, you'll have a better idea of what you\u2019re comfortable paying and how soon you\u2019d pay off your personal loan.

Her mortgage expertise was honed post-2008 crisis as she implemented the significant changes resulting from Dodd-Frank required regulations. Sturti / Getty Images With most personal loans, it takes two to five days to get your money after your application is approved. So-called \"instant loans\" can reduce that time, often getting you your money the same day you apply. However, a number of things can delay the process. An \"instant\" personal loan is a personal loan in which the lender immediately makes a decision on whether to approve the loan. These lenders aim to evaluate your application and send you your funds quickly, if not always instantly. An instant personal loan works in the same way as a standard personal loan. You can apply online or in person. The lender will perform a credit check to decide if you qualify for the loan and determine what interest rate to offer you. If you are approved for the loan and accept it, the lender will send you a lump sum of money. You must then pay this money back, generally in equal monthly installments over a set period, which is typically a few months to several years. You'll pay interest on the loan, and sometimes fees. You can get a personal loan from financial institutions like banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Some lenders offer fast processing times for personal loans. They include (in alphabetical order) LightStream, Rocket Loans, and SoFi. LightStream, for example, says same-day funding is available if your application is approved, you sign the loan agreement, and you complete the verification process by 2:30 p.m. Eastern time on a banking business day and schedule funding by 3 p.m. However, while lenders may be able to process your loan application the same day you apply, other factors may slow down your receipt of the money. For example, lenders will often send your money via Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfer. While this is potentially quicker than a wire transfer, it's not instant. You'll have to wait for your bank to accept the transfer and give you access to the funds. In some cases, that could take a few days. As with any financial product, instant personal loans have pros and cons. Fast funding Cheaper rates than credit cards Convenience May require good credit for quick approval Fewer lenders to choose from The process of applying for an instant personal loan is largely the same as applying for a regular personal loan. You should first determine how much money you need. You can generally borrow $1,000 to $50,000, though higher amounts may be available if you have excellent credit. Then, review your finances to make sure you can comfortably handle the monthly loan repayments. This personal loan calculator can help. Next, compare lenders. You can use our review of the best fast personal loans to compare prices and terms. Finally, you can apply online by filling out the lender's application form. Generally, the applications are straightforward and require personal information like your Social Security number and income, among other data. In 2023, Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds or might use a loan in the future. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvements, and other large expenditures. If you need cash quickly, an instant personal loan is often a good option, since these loans generally have lower interest rates than alternative sources. However, if you don't want to use an instant personal loan or can't qualify, you can consider some other financing options. They include: If you need money immediately, you options can include instant personal loans, credit card cash advances, and payday alternative loans. Secured loans tend to have less stringent approval requirements and more favorable terms because the lender can seize your collateral and sell it if you miss your loan payments. While personal loans are generally unsecured, secured personal loans are also available. You can use the money from a personal loan as soon as you receive it and it clears your bank, even if it's on the same day you apply. Most loans become available within a few days of approval, some faster. Some personal loan lenders promise to process your application and make your funds available on the same day you apply. While your application may be approved instantly and the lender may release the funds quickly, you may still have to wait on your bank's normal processing times to access them.

ShapeCharge / Getty Images It is possible to get a $100,000 personal loan, but it\u2019s difficult. Even the best personal loan providers don\u2019t typically offer loans of more than $50,000, and they require a high credit score. They also can have fairly high interest rates. Personal loans are a type of unsecured debt. Since they are riskier for lenders because they are not backed by an asset, lenders may be hesitant to lend you a large amount of money, especially if you don\u2019t have an existing relationship with them. However, if you are looking for a large personal loan, you can find options. Learn more about your choices for personal loans for $100,000 and about some common qualification criteria. Every loan provider has its own set of requirements to qualify for a personal loan. To qualify for a large loan, however, you\u2019ll generally need: Not many personal loan providers offer $100,000 loans, but here are banks that do: Though all of these lenders will provide personal loans to borrowers with a \u201cgood\u201d credit score, which is one from 670 to 739, you\u2019ll likely need a significantly higher credit score to be approved for the largest loans. Similarly, the interest rates on large loans are likely to be much higher than on smaller loans, even if you have a good credit score. Getting a personal loan for $100,000 is similar to getting any personal loan. The difference is that you\u2019ll typically need a high credit score, a high income, and perhaps an existing relationship with your lender to be approved. Here are the main steps for getting a large personal loan: The cost of any personal loan over time mainly depends on two factors: the interest rate and the loan term (length of the loan). Loans with a high interest rate and a long term cost more, and vice versa. You can use Investopedia\u2019s personal loan calculator to compare the total costs of loans with different interest rates and terms. Let\u2019s take two examples and calculate the cost of the loans. A loan for $100,000, paid back over just two years, would have a high monthly repayment of $4,848.66 per month, so you would need a high income to afford these repayments. However, paying back this loan over such a short period means that you\u2019ll lower the total cost you\u2019ll pay in interest, which will be $16,367.96. If you take out the same loan, but pay it back more slowly, your monthly repayments will be lower at $2,536.26 per month. However, even if you get a better interest rate of 10%, you\u2019ll pay more interest over the lifetime of the loan, with a total cost of $21,740.40. Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, to Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. If you need to borrow a large amount of money, you can consider other sources of funding in addition to a personal loan. If you can get a secured loan, you will likely have better rates. For example, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) use your home equity to back a large-size loan or line of credit. If you have a substantial amount of money saved in a tax-advantaged retirement account like a 401(k), you can potentially borrow money from it. You could also borrow money from any cash value you accrued with a permanent life insurance policy. With a high credit score and income, you might be approved for a $100,000 loan the same day you apply. However, lenders sometimes do extra credit and financial checks for large loans, which can slow the process. You cannot get a $100,000 loan with bad credit. To get a large personal loan, you will need a good credit score. The exact score you will need will vary by lender. Most lenders don\u2019t offer loans above $100,000, and many don\u2019t offer loans of more than $30,000 or $50,000. However, private banks that cater to wealthy individuals might offer personal loans of $100,000 or more. The size of loan that is right for you depends on your finances and your needs. Any personal loan that you will struggle to meet the repayments for is too large. If you fail to repay the loan, your credit score will suffer and you will find it more difficult to get approved for loans in the future. Loans larger than $100,000 are not common. When you need to make a large purchase, other loan products such as a mortgage may be more suitable than a personal loan. If you do need $100,000 or more in financing, and you don\u2019t qualify for a personal loan, you can consider alternatives like home equity loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), or borrowing from your 401(k). myFICO. \u201cWhat Is a Credit Score?\u201d Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cDebt-to-Income Calculator.\u201d Page 2.

A personal loan is one way to pay for school-related costs, but it\u2019s not the only one. You can pay for school through other means, including: Every personal loan lender has a different set of eligibility requirements. It\u2019s important to check out what you\u2019ll need to qualify before applying for a personal loan. You should compare lenders based on: It\u2019s a good idea to compare different types of loans from multiple lenders based on your needs, and see which ones offer the best terms for you. A personal loan has different requirements than a student loan, including: Can borrow whenever you need to Fast funding Better than credit cards Expensive option Repayment starts right away No protections or forgiveness Some lenders restrict personal loan usage for tuition and other school-related costs. You might be able to use a personal loan for some school expenses, such as certain supplies and transportation, but you might not be able to pay for a higher education directly. Most personal loan lenders require repayment to start immediately, and you don\u2019t get the option to defer your student loans. If you wish to have the option of a personal loan deferment, then you might need to take out a federal or private student loan. Personal loans can be used for almost anything, while student loans are school-specific. Student loans are paid directly to your college or university, and they tend to have lower interest rates and longer repayment terms than personal loans. You might be limited in how much you can borrow with a personal loan, while private student loans may allow you to borrow up to the cost of attendance (COA). When you complete a personal loan application, you\u2019ll trigger a hard credit check, which temporarily causes your credit score to drop. It usually rebounds after a few months of on-time payments. However, if you miss a payment or have a string of missed payments, your credit score will likely plummet, and it could take months or years to bring it back up. Personal loans can be a useful tool for funding a higher education, ideally by covering education-adjacent expenses that fall outside the typical purview of a student loan. Relying entirely on a personal loan to pay for college may not be feasible, and even if this weren\u2019t the case, it would likely be more costly in the long run. Be sure to investigate whether you can get any scholarships, grants, and student loans first, and then consider using a personal loan to fill in any gaps if necessary.

He has published widely on personal finance, marketing, and the impact of technology on contemporary arts and culture.

Investopedia / Joules Garcia Personal loans are a type of loan that you can use for a variety of purposes. If you\u2019re approved for a personal loan, you\u2019ll receive a sum of money that you must then pay back over time with interest. Personal loans sometimes also have other fees, such as origination fees. Personal loans are offered by a variety of lenders like banks, online lenders, and credit unions. A personal bank loan is simply a personal loan taken out with a bank. Banks are the most popular provider of personal loans, but they may not be the best provider for you. You can apply for a personal loan from a variety of lenders, including banks. If you're approved for the loan, the lender will lend you a sum of money. You must then pay back this money, typically in equal monthly payments (installments), over a set period\u2014generally one to five years. You will pay interest on the loan, and you may be charged fees as well. Personal loans can be used for almost any purpose, whether you need to make a major purchase, consolidate debt, or pay for an emergency expense. The cost of a personal loan varies and depends on the interest rate you are offered and how long you\u2019ll spend paying back the loan, along with any fees that the lender charges. The interest rate you will be charged depends on how much you borrow and your credit score. It can also depend on other factors like your annual income, payment history, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. The longer you spend paying back the loan, the longer you will be paying interest, so the more expensive the loan will be overall. Banks are the most popular source of personal loans. Personal bank loans have both advantages and disadvantages over personal loans from other lenders. You can compare loan costs with different interest rates and terms using Investopedia\u2019s personal loan calculator. Since personal bank loans can be used for almost any purpose, loan terms vary a lot. Some loans are for $1,000, and are paid back over a couple of months. Others can be for as much as $50,000 or $100,000, and take 10 years or more to repay. The main features of a personal bank loan are: Personal loans can be used for almost any purpose, and most banks won\u2019t ask you to specify what you want to use the loan for. Common uses for a personal loan include: Personal loans are different from other installment loans like student loans, car loans, and mortgage loans, all of which are used to fund specific expenses (i.e., education, vehicles, or homes, respectively). You can use a personal loan for nearly any purpose. While you are applying for a personal bank loan, the bank will look at a number of factors to assess whether you qualify. The most important factor is your credit score. You\u2019ll typically need a credit score of at least 640 to 670 to get the best loan terms. The higher your credit score, the lower the interest rate you will be offered. Your credit score is affected by your payment history and a number of other factors. If you have a poor credit score, you may want to take steps to repair your credit score before applying again. That may include paying down debt and making all your payments on time. If you don\u2019t qualify for an unsecured personal loan, you might be able to get a secured loan by using an asset as collateral. This will improve your chances of qualifying because the loan will be a lower risk for the lender. However, you'll be at risk of losing your asset if you can\u2019t repay the loan. Applying for a personal loan involves four main steps: A personal loan and a consumer loan are the same thing. These loans provide a lump sum of money that you can use for nearly any purpose. You repay personal loans and consumer loans in regular payments over a set period of time. A cash advance and a personal loan are both ways to borrow money. While a cash advance is a short-term high-interest loan, often used to cover emergency expenses, a personal loan usually has lower rates in comparison and is paid back over a longer period of time. Typically, banks offer personal loans from several hundred to several thousand dollars. For amounts smaller than this, it can sometimes make sense to use a credit card instead. Personal loans generally have much lower interest rates than credit cards, making them much less expensive in the long term.\u00a0However, for daily purchases, a credit card may be better if you can pay the balance off by the next billing cycle. A personal bank loan is a sum of money that can be used for almost any purpose and is paid back over time with interest. Personal loans tend to have high borrowing limits, reasonable interest rates, and can be convenient. You may be able to get a better rate, however, by taking a personal loan from a credit union. Consider asking a financial advisor for guidance on your financing options and what option would be best for your situation.

He has published widely on personal finance, marketing, and the impact of technology on contemporary arts and culture. Klaus Vedfelt / GettyImages You can use a personal loan to pay for a wedding or any wedding-related cost, before or after your wedding. You can use a personal loan for almost any purpose, including covering the cost of your wedding. The average cost of a wedding in the United States was $35,000 in 2023, according to a study by The Knot. Some couples cover those costs by taking out a personal loan, which is a lump sum of financing that you repay over time. However, this strategy for funding a wedding has its upsides and downsides. A wedding loan is a personal loan that you use for wedding costs. You can get a personal loan from a bank, credit union, or online lender. Personal loans are flexible and can be used for almost any purpose, so they can be a good option to finance your wedding. Many couples didn't cover the entire cost of their wedding themselves, according to wedding website Zola. Instead, they relied on credit cards, gift registries, or personal loans in addition to their own savings. You can use a personal loan to cover any cost associated with a wedding. These include (with average 2023 costs, according to The Knot): The maximum amount you can borrow for a personal loan depends on a variety of factors, including the lender\u2019s limits and what you can qualify for with your credit score and income. The smallest loans that most lenders will consider are for around $1,000, and many won\u2019t lend more than $50,000 in normal circumstances. A few lenders may lend up to $100,000. In general, you should get the smallest loan that meets your needs, because personal loans in any amount have interest costs and are included in your debt. You will pay interest on the loan as you pay it back, so a larger loan will be more expensive in the long run. You can use our personal loan calculator to compare total costs and payment amounts using different interest rates and terms. To qualify for any kind of personal loan, including one for a wedding, you\u2019ll have to meet certain requirements: Convenience Flexibility Low interest rates and fees Interest Debt Temptation to spend Many couples receive financial help from their families to cover the cost of their wedding. This is a great way to finance your wedding, of course, as family members tend to offer low interest rates and generous loan terms. If you haven't saved enough to pay for your wedding and you don\u2019t want to rely on family members, you have a few options in addition to getting a personal loan. First, if you own a home and have equity, you can take out a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC). These are secured loans that use your home equity as collateral. These loans tend to have lower interest rates than unsecured personal loans. A credit card is another option to pay for wedding expenses, but in general, it's not ideal. You could get into financial trouble if you cannot pay off the balances. Credit cards have high interest rates that can add to the costs quickly. One strategy may be to apply for a new credit card with a 0% introductory rate. If you can pay the balance before the introductory term ends, you won't be charged interest. However, if you carry a balance after that, interest can compound quickly. Delaying your wedding to save more is another option to help you cover your wedding costs without any interest costs. You may also want to review your wedding budget and see where you can reduce expenses. Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, to Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. The venue, the engagement ring, and the live band were often the largest wedding expenses, according to a 2023 study by The Knot. The rehearsal dinner, the wedding planner, and the photographer were also among the top expenses. Traditionally, the bride\u2019s family pays for the wedding, but this custom is become less prevalent as time goes on. It's becoming increasingly common for the couple to pay some or all of the wedding expenses themselves. Since the bride's family traditionally pays for the wedding, the groom\u2019s family would pay for the honeymoon. Nowadays, who pays for the honeymoon can depend on family dynamics, traditions, and, of course, the couple\u2019s personal preference. Couples may opt to fund their honeymoon on their own. If you need to finance a wedding, a personal loan can be a good option. For most borrowers, a personal loan will have a lower interest rate than a credit card, and you can pay it back in regular monthly installments. Of course, a better option is to save up for your wedding and pay in cash if possible, as that way you\u2019ll pay no interest at all.

            "content": "Canadians have several personal loan options available Karon Warren has 20+ years of experience researching and writing about banking, mortgages, credit cards, savings, and other personal finance topics. Moon Safari / Getty Images Borrowers in Canada can take advantage of several personal loan options to fit their needs. If you meet the lender requirements, you can choose from secured or unsecured personal loans to use for a variety of purposes. Learn more about the availability of personal loans in Canada. Personal loans provide you with a lump sum of money, which you pay back in installments over a set period of time along with interest. Interest rates may be fixed, meaning they stay the same for the life of the loan, or variable, meaning they change periodically during the loan term. Like most personal loans, personal loans in Canada have loan terms that typically range from a few months to several years, and their amounts range from about $100 to $50,000. Personal loans can be used for a variety of purposes, such as buying a car, paying for a wedding, covering emergency expenses, or consolidating credit card debt. The two main types of personal loans are secured, which require collateral, and unsecured, which don't require any collateral. A secured loan requires collateral, which is an asset like your car or home that the lender can seize to offset losses if you fail to make payments. This essentially lowers the lending risk. Common types of secured loans include: Unsecured loans don't require collateral to guarantee the loan. If you default on an unsecured loan, the lender can enter into collection proceedings, including filing a lawsuit against you. However, they cannot seize your assets. Another option that lenders can use to collect on a defaulted unsecured loan is the right to offset. Typically included in the loan agreement, the right to offset allows the lender to take money from other accounts you hold with them, such as checking or savings accounts. They also can take funds from accounts you have with the lender\u2019s affiliates. This applies to accounts in your name as well as joint accounts you share with others. Using the right to offset, lenders can take funds without notifying you or getting your permission. They also may take all the funds in your account, which could result in non-sufficient funds (NSFs) fees for checks or other attempted debits. Personal loans are available from financial institutions like banks and credit unions. You can also get certain types of personal loans in Canada from nontraditional lenders, such as title loan companies, pawnshops, payday lenders, and private lenders. When applying for a personal loan in Canada, you can start by shopping for the best loan by comparing rates. Here are more key steps. Compare loan offers from several lenders. The key factors to compare include the interest rate, the loan terms, and fees. Keep in mind that the shorter the loan term, the less you will pay in interest. Additionally, ask for an itemized list of fees so you understand the charges. Under Canadian law, lenders cannot charge more than 60% interest annually. That amount includes not only interest but also all fees and associated costs. Once you choose a lender, you will need to provide basic information, including your income and permanent address. You also will need a bank account and will need to show a government-issued identification, along with any other documents that the lender requires. When you apply for a personal loan, the lender will likely run a credit check to learn about your risk as a borrower. The lender will review your credit report, which is a summary of your credit history, and check your credit score. Your credit score is a three-digit number that reflects your ability to manage money.\u00a0The two main credit bureaus in Canada that provide your credit score are Equifax and TransUnion. Credit scores are used to determine if a lender will approve your loan as well as what interest rate is charged on the loan. Typically, the better your credit score is, the lower the interest rate will be on the loan. If you're approved for a personal loan, review all paperwork on the loan to make sure you agree to the terms. Don't sign the loan contract if the terms aren't acceptable. Loan terms to review include: Ensure there are no unexpected charges, such as for optional loan insurance. By Canadian law, federally regulated banks cannot charge for optional loan insurance unless you explicitly agree. Next, you will receive the loan funds, which can be provided in one of several ways: If you don\u2019t qualify for a personal loan or prefer a different method of financing, you can turn to other potential funding options like personal lines of credit, credit cards, or borrowing from family or friends. A personal line of credit shares similarities with a personal loan, but it has key differences. While a personal loan has a fixed loan amount, a personal line of credit allows you to borrow the amount of money you need, which could be less than the amount you're approved to borrow. When you repay what you have borrowed on a line of credit, that credit becomes available to you again. You only pay interest on the amount you borrow with a line of credit, not on the entire amount you are approved to borrow.\u00a0Like a personal loan, you are required to make minimum payments toward the balance. You also can pay off the entire balance anytime. If you have credit available on your credit cards, you can charge purchases to them. However, interest rates on credit cards are typically significantly higher than those on personal loans, so you will likely pay much more in interest if you don\u2019t pay off the balances each month. If you are late making a credit card payment, you will also incur substantial late fees that could increase your total debt and lower your credit score. When borrowing from family or friends, you likely won\u2019t have to pay interest or associated fees, and you may not have an exact repayment date. You may not even have to make payments. However, if you don\u2019t repay the loan in a timely manner, it could create a tense situation with loved ones. If you do borrow from family or friends, consider putting the loan terms in writing, including a date for paying off the balance. Loan requirements for a personal loan in Canada include having an income, a permanent address, and a bank account.\u00a0Lenders will check your credit history and credit score to determine your risk as a borrower before approving you for a loan. Each lender has their own minimum credit score requirements. For many people, borrowing money from banks or credit unions is easy, provided that they meet the lending requirements.\u00a0To apply for a personal loan, fill out an application with a bank, credit union, or alternative lender and submit any documents they request, such as an ID or proof of income. You don\u2019t have to be a citizen to get a loan in Canada. You do have to be a permanent resident with a valid permanent resident card. For qualified borrowers, there are several personal loan options in Canada. These include both secured and unsecured loans, which can be used for many different purposes. Be sure to weigh the pros and cons of a personal loan as it relates to your financial situation before you decide to take one out.

            "title": "Are There Personal Loans for Disabled Veterans?",
            "content": "Veterans have many options when it comes to financial assistance Karon Warren has 20+ years of experience researching and writing about banking, mortgages, credit cards, savings, and other personal finance topics. Katie Miller is a consumer financial services expert. She worked for almost two decades as an executive, leading multi-billion dollar mortgage, credit card, and savings portfolios with operations worldwide and a unique focus on the consumer. Her mortgage expertise was honed post-2008 crisis as she implemented the significant changes resulting from Dodd-Frank required regulations. SDI Productions / Getty Images While there are no personal loans designed specifically for veterans, including disabled veterans, veterans can apply for personal loans just like anyone else. Veterans can receive specific benefits for other financial products, including U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) home loans, which are a type of mortgage. Learn more about financial products geared specifically for veterans and how to choose a personal loan. Neither the VA nor financial institutions offer personal loans specifically for disabled veterans, but disabled veterans can apply for general personal loans with banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Generally, personal loans are issued as a lump sum that you repay over time in regular payments. They can be used for nearly any financial need and are usually issued as unsecured loans, meaning they don\u2019t require collateral. To get a personal loan, disabled veterans must meet the same eligibility requirements as anyone, such as minimum income and credit score requirements. Once approved, you can discuss loan terms such as interest rates, length of loan, and monthly payments. Many traditional and online lenders will work with veterans and active-duty military members as well as their families. These include: Some of these lenders require borrowers to be members to be eligible for financial products. Check all qualifying factors before applying for a personal loan. Beyond personal loans, disabled veterans could qualify for other types of loan products to use for specific purposes, like buying a home or building a small business. The VA guarantees home loans that financial institutions and mortgage lenders issue to veterans. The benefits of a VA home loan include no down payment requirements, no prepayment penalties, and no requirement to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI). These loans also have competitive interest rates. Disabled veterans are also exempt from paying the VA funding fee, a one-time payment used to help lower the cost of the loan for U.S. taxpayers. Disabled veterans can include their disability compensation as income when applying for a VA home loan. This could increase the likelihood that they will get approved. Veterans who have an outstanding mortgage on their home and have built up equity can refinance their existing loan to access the equity value. A cash-out refinance involves taking out a new mortgage for a larger amount than your existing loan, paying off the old loan, and getting paid the difference as a cash lump sum. The funds from a cash-out refinance can be used for home improvements, debt consolidation, or other financial needs. An interest rate reduction refinance loan (IRRRL) is typically used to refinance an existing VA home loan to get a lower interest rate. You can also use an IRRRL to refinance a VA home loan with an adjustable rate to one with a fixed rate to get predictable monthly payments that will not change. Native American veterans or veterans married to Native Americans could qualify for a home loan to purchase, build, or renovate a home on federal trust land. The loans, called Native American Direct Loans (NADLs), also could be used to refinance an existing loan for a home on federal trust land to lower the interest rate. Veterans, including disabled veterans, could receive upfront funds via an escrow account, which are then applied to the monthly payment for a period of one to three years. As a result, you would have a lower monthly payment in the first one to three years of the home mortgage. The buydown funds could come from the seller, the lender, the builder, or the veteran. The VA offers Specially Adapted Housing grants for disabled veterans who want to buy or renovate a house to meet their needs, such as by installing a ramp or widening a doorway. To qualify, veterans must own or plan to own the house, and they must have a qualifying service-connected disability. The Small Business Administration (SBA) partners with lenders to offer a variety of loans to small businesses, including veteran-owned businesses. These include: Loan amounts, guaranty percentage, collateral requirements, and other terms and conditions vary by SBA loan. The SBA offers the Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan (MREIDL) program for veteran-owned small businesses with employees who serve in the Reserves or National Guard. They could receive loans of up to $2 million in the event that an essential employee is called to active duty and the business owner is unable to meet their operating costs. When you\u2019re shopping for a personal loan, compare several loans. You can often pre-qualify for a personal loan with a soft credit check that does not affect your credit score. Or, if you apply for several personal loans within a short time period (within 45 days), the hard credit checks will only count as one credit check and will only have a minor, temporary effect on your credit score. Compare a number of factors to determine which loan is the best choice for you, including interest rate, length of loan, fees, and turnaround time. Personal loans typically have fixed interest rates, but they vary by lender. So, it\u2019s important to get rate quotes from at least three different lenders to find the best interest rate.\u00a0When you have a lower interest rate, you can save more money in the long term and have lower monthly payments. The loan term determines how much your monthly payment will be, as well as how much interest you will pay over the life of the loan. Shorter loan terms result in lower interest costs but higher monthly payments. Longer loans offer lower monthly payments, but they will be more expensive in the long run. The right loan term for you will depend on your financial situation. Lenders may charge fees to take out personal loans, which can increase the total loan amount. These include origination fees, application fees, and documentation fees. In addition, you could incur late fees for making late payments, as well as prepayment penalty fees, by paying the loan off early. Get a complete list of fees from each lender and compare to find the lowest fees available. Some personal loans could be approved and funded on the same day, while others may take several days for approval and funding. Ask each lender what the funding time is to determine when you\u2019ll receive the funds from your personal loan.\u00a0If you need funds immediately, turnaround time will likely be a high priority when comparing loans. You cannot take out a loan on your VA disability.\u00a0However, disabled veterans can qualify for various loans designed specifically to provide benefits to them, such as a VA loan for buying a home. The VA does not offer any personal loans. However, veterans can apply for a traditional personal loan, which they can use for a wide range of purposes. Banks and credit unions do not typically offer personal loans specifically designed for disabled veterans. Veterans can apply for a variety of loans, including personal loans, housing loans, and small business loans, through traditional financial institutions and online lenders.\u00a0Loans specifically for veterans include VA loans, which are mortgages with no down payment requirements. Veterans can also apply for various grants or payments for specialty vehicles. For VA loans, the maximum amount you can borrow will be determined by the lender. Lenders base the maximum loan amount on factors like your credit score, income, and assets. You can get a VA-backed loan through banks and credit unions that offer them. For more information, visit Benefits.gov or talk to a representative at your local financial institution. Disabled veterans can apply for personal loans at traditional financial institutions such as banks or credit unions, as well as with online lenders. In addition, they could qualify for financial products like housing loans, grants, and small business loans. As with all borrowers, disabled veterans must meet the lender's qualification requirements to be approved.

Hispanolistic / Getty Images If you file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you are able to restructure your debts and then pay them off over a period of three to five years under court supervision. After you\u2019ve repaid your creditors, you will be able to apply for personal loans again, but with a much lower credit score than before, which might limit you to personal loan lenders that work with bad credit. You can also get a personal loan while still in your repayment period for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but it\u2019s difficult. Regulations vary among states. In most cases, you\u2019ll have to get the court\u2019s permission before taking out any new credit, including a personal loan. You can possibly get a personal loan while you are still paying off your Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan, but it can be difficult as a result of the rules that govern Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The six different types of bankruptcy in the United States are Chapters 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 15. Chapters 7 and 13 are most commonly used by individuals, while Chapter 11 is primarily for businesses. The other types of bankruptcy are for more specialized purposes. The differences between Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy include eligibility, cost, and the amount of time required to complete the process. Chapter 13 is for individuals with stable incomes while also having specific debt limits. This type of bankruptcy includes an appointed trustee who will distribute all income to creditors over a three- to five-year period. The law recognizes that people who are still in the repayment period of Chapter 13 bankruptcy may need to take out new loans. However, in most cases, you must get the court\u2019s permission to borrow money. Even if you get court approval to take on a new loan during your Chapter 13 repayment period, you will face a second obstacle: your credit score. A Chapter 13 bankruptcy will remain on your credit report for seven years, and it has a significant effect on your credit score. Depending on your credit score before bankruptcy, it can be difficult to qualify for any kind of personal loan. Most of the best personal loan lenders require a credit score of at least 600. If your credit score is below that, you\u2019ll need to look for a lender that offers bad credit personal loans. Before looking for a personal loan while in Chapter 13, understand that your trustee court will only permit you to incur new debt for personal, family, or household purposes if it is necessary for you to continue to make payments under your plan. For example, if you need a reliable work car to earn money to make your Chapter 13 repayments, the court may approve you to take out a loan to purchase a vehicle. In rare cases, the court may allow you to take out a mortgage loan to purchase a new home, but only if your monthly mortgage repayments are lower than your current rental costs. If you believe that you qualify for a personal loan while in Chapter 13, the first step is to look for a loan. You can apply for a personal loan from any lender. However, your bankruptcy will appear on your credit report, and your credit score is likely to be much lower than it was before your bankruptcy. This may limit you to bad-credit personal loans or other types of financing for bad credit. In any case, the process of applying for a personal loan is the same whether you are in bankruptcy or not. Once you are approved for a loan, you will receive your funds and must then repay them with regular payments over a set time period. Next, you must get permission from the bankruptcy court to take out the loan. The specific procedures for this vary by court, so you should check these with your attorney. In general, however, you\u2019ll have to: Keep in mind that this is not a guaranteed process, so you may not be approved for the loan. It can take a month or more to go through the process before you can even receive approval. It may be tempting to take out a payday loan while you are in Chapter 13, but payday loans are regarded as a form of predatory lending and may push you further into debt. The process is the same for taking out any kind of new debt during Chapter 13, whether this is a personal loan, a peer-to-peer loan, or a car loan. Different trustees have different rules about what kinds of debt you can take on, so check with your Chapter 13 attorney before applying for any kind of loan. However, if you are facing financial difficulties, it\u2019s often better to renegotiate your Chapter 13 agreement rather than take on new debt. The process for this depends on whether your difficulties are short-term or long-term: You are generally barred from taking on any new debt while in Chapter 13 unless you have a pressing need. If a loan can help you repay your debts, such as if you need an auto loan to get a new car to go to work to earn wages, it\u2019s possible that you may be allowed to take on more debt. It\u2019s possible to get a car loan immediately after bankruptcy, but you should be prepared to have your credit history come under closer scrutiny from lenders.\u00a0Your credit score will be much lower after bankruptcy, which could mean you would likely pay higher interest rates or get denied a loan. A Chapter 13 bankruptcy stays on your credit report for seven years. In general, it takes 12 to 18 months to start improving your credit score after your Chapter 13 bankruptcy is discharged, but it may take many years to get back to where you were. You can begin rebuilding your credit score during Chapter 13 bankruptcy by making on-time repayments to your bankruptcy plan. However, it\u2019s likely to take a few years to repair the impact of a bankruptcy on your credit score. In most cases, the court will only let you complete your Chapter 13 bankruptcy early under two conditions: You can get a personal loan while you are still repaying your Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan, but it\u2019s difficult. Your trustee court will only allow you to take on new debt if there is a pressing need and if it will help you make your repayments on time. Due to the significant negative impact of the bankruptcy on your credit score, you might have difficulty qualifying for a loan. Even if you qualify, you\u2019ll need the court\u2019s permission to take it.

He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Delmaine Donson / Getty Images A $35,000 personal loan can be used for nearly any purpose. Common uses of personal loans include: While you have ample flexibility with how to use a personal loan, there are some restrictions. For example, lenders typically do not allow you to use a personal loan for college tuition or to repay existing student loans. Lenders also may not permit a personal loan to fund the purchase of a home. If you have an established business, you will likely need to apply for a business loan or business line of credit, rather than a personal loan, to cover business expenses. Lenders will consider various criteria before extending you a personal loan offer. The personal loan application process can vary depending on the lender, but you will usually be asked to provide documents such as: Getting loan estimates from multiple lenders can help you make an informed decision. Important factors when comparing lenders include: The total cost of a personal loan will depend on your interest rate and the fees (such as an origination fee, late fee, and prepayment penalty) that your lender charges. You can use a personal loan calculator to get an idea of how much your monthly payments will be for a $35,000 personal loan with different terms. For example, your $35,000 loan monthly payment could be $1,697.03 if you have a two-year term and a 15% interest rate. Over the lifetime of the loan, you would pay $5,728.78 in interest. The total cost of the loan would be $40,728.78. A longer term for a $35,000 personal loan with the same interest rate will result in a higher total cost. For example, a three-year term with a 15% interest rate could result in you paying $1,213.29 monthly and $8,678.31 in total interest. The total loan would be $43,678.31. The shorter the term and the lower the interest rate, the less expensive the total cost of the loan. You can get a personal loan from a financial institution like a bank, a credit union, or an online lender. If you already have checking and savings accounts with a particular bank, using them as your personal loan lender may be convenient. Given their often-large size, banks may be able to offer you a larger personal loan if you qualify. Traditional banks may have stricter lending criteria, making it more difficult for someone with poor credit to qualify for a personal loan. Credit unions may offer lower interest rates compared to banks. In June 2023, the national average interest rate for an unsecured fixed-rate loan with a 36-month term offered through credit unions was 10.89%, while the national average rate for the same type of loan offered via banks was 11.79%, according to the National Credit Union Administration. You need to be a member of a credit union to apply for a personal loan. If you plan to apply in person, keep in mind that a credit union may not have as many physical locations as a bank. Many online lenders offer personal loans. With the entire process online, it can be easy to compare loan offers from multiple lenders. You might be able to access better rates and terms with an online lender than with a bank or credit union, particularly if you have bad credit. An online lender will not have physical locations if you prefer to use your banking services in person. Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, and Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. Many lenders offer personal loans of $35,000. Remember to compare your interest rate, loan term, and any lender fees. Here are some examples of lenders offering loans of $35,000 and their interest rates as of September 2024. Lenders typically offer better terms to personal loan applicants who have a credit score of 640 or higher. You may still be able to get a $35,000 personal loan with a lower credit score, but you will likely have to pay a higher interest rate. Your interest rate for a $35,000 loan will depend on different factors, including your creditworthiness, the length of the loan, and the cost of borrowing. Getting a $35,000 loan with bad credit may be possible, but lenders are unlikely to offer you their most favorable terms. The interest rate could be higher than average, and the repayment term may be short. Be sure you can afford the payments before signing the loan agreement. Yes, you can pay off a loan early, but some lenders charge a prepayment penalty. This fee helps lenders recoup lost interest payments when a loan gets paid off early. However, check your loan agreement or ask your lender since not all lenders charge prepayment penalties. How much you can borrow with a personal loan will depend on your creditworthiness. In most cases, $100,000 is the most lenders will offer for a personal loan. You can use a $35,000 personal loan for almost any purpose. If you decide that a personal loan is right for you, shop around and compare lenders to find an option with the best interest rate and terms. Remember, make sure you can afford the monthly payments before signing a loan agreement.

There are a few different ways to pay for an engagement ring, including personal loans, credit cards, and cash. Here\u2019s how to figure out how much you should pay and which way works best for you. While buying within budget is ideal, it\u2019s not an option for everyone. As such, you might need to get a personal loan for an engagement ring. A personal loan is a good financing option for an engagement ring if you\u2019re able to qualify for a low rate and require two or more years to pay off the debt. The following is a simple step-by-step guide on what you need to do to apply for a personal loan and how to use those funds to purchase an engagement ring. While a personal loan is one way to finance an engagement ring, it isn\u2019t the only one. You may want to look into some alternatives, including: Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, to Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. How much financing you get with bad credit depends on where you\u2019re trying to get funding and how much you want to borrow. Some personal lenders may offer you a loan, but not always for the amount you need. Others could deny you based on your credit history. This usually depends on how much the engagement ring is and the type of financing you\u2019re utilizing. If you\u2019re taking out a personal loan, you can pay for the entire ring in full and then make monthly payments on your loan. If you\u2019re getting financing through your jeweler, you may need to put a percentage down. If you take out a personal loan for an engagement ring, you\u2019ll make monthly installment payments until your loan is paid in full. If you instead use a store credit card, you\u2019ll also be required to make minimum monthly payments to keep your account in good standing. On average, people spent around $5,500 on an engagement ring in 2023\u2014but that is the national average. What you spend on a ring will depend on your budget, your partner\u2019s preference, and where you purchase it. An engagement ring is only the beginning of wedding costs. Try to budget for a ring that best fits your needs right now, or figure out how to save for the future. The average cost of a wedding in the United States was $35,000 in 2023, and that doesn\u2019t include the cost of an engagement ring. While weddings are a one-day affair, you may not want to bring a lot of debt into your new marriage.

            "content": "How to write a personal loan agreement and what a pre-written contract should include BongkarnThanyakij / Getty Images When you get a loan, you might need to sign a personal loan contract or a personal loan agreement. A personal loan agreement and a personal loan contract are two names for the same thing. They are designed to set expectations for a loan so that both the borrower and the lender understand the terms. A personal loan agreement can be referred to if there are questions about repayment, and it can be used to legally enforce terms if one party doesn\u2019t adhere to them. For loans by a commercial lender, the lender will provide the agreement. You will need to create your own contract for loans between friends or relatives. A personal loan agreement is a legally binding document designed to clearly define the terms of repayment for a loan, in addition to what\u2019s expected of the borrower and the lender. It should include information about the amount borrowed, the interest charges associated with the loan, any fees that are part of the process, and a repayment schedule that details when the loan should be repaid and what installments will be used. Because a personal loan contract is legally binding, a lender can take a borrower to court and have repayment ordered, including wage garnishment, a lien, or some other recourse. In many cases, personal loans are unsecured, meaning you don\u2019t need to have some form of collateral to secure the loan. Basically, your creditworthiness is what\u2019s considered, not whether you have something valuable like a car or a home that can be repossessed to offset any credit risk. While a\u00a0lender\u00a0can offer a personal loan that requires collateral to secure it, it\u2019s relatively uncommon. Official lenders like banks, credit unions, and online lenders have their own agreements that you must sign. It might be tempting not to formalize the process for loans between friends or relatives, but this can be a mistake. Using a personal loan agreement when lending to family or friends can ensure that everyone remembers the terms of the loan, in addition to establishing a more official and professional acknowledgment of the debt and when it should be repaid. Whether you\u2019re signing a personal loan agreement created by someone else or making your own contract, it\u2019s important to make sure you have the necessary information included so that everything is accounted for and the terms are clear. When writing a personal loan agreement, it\u2019s important to make sure that you review the document and ensure that it has all the elements of a personal loan contract. It can be a very simple agreement that states each item in its own section. You can create a hard-copy version or use a service like DocuSign or eSign to complete the paperwork online. You can also find templates on websites like LegalZoom, LawDepot, and Rocket Lawyer. Below, see a sample personal loan agreement from LawDistrict. Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, to Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. Anytime money is being borrowed or lent, it\u2019s a good idea to have a personal loan contract. Most commercial lenders will require you to sign a personal loan agreement. Yes, the terms of a personal loan contract can be changed, but both the borrower and the lender need to agree to the changes. In some cases, a lender might replace the old agreement with a new agreement if the terms are different enough. If you don\u2019t comply with the terms of a loan contract, you might be taken to court for legal recourse. This can lead to a lawsuit, resulting in a judge requiring a specific payment plan or garnishing your wages to complete the terms. In general, a personal loan contract is just as legally binding between friends or family as it would be with a bank. However, a contract between friends or family might be simpler or have fewer terms. Each agreement, though, is likely to have the same main provisions. A personal loan contract is the same thing as a personal loan agreement. It\u2019s important to make sure that you have a legally binding contract in place, whether you borrow or lend money. Major lenders will require you to sign an agreement before they disperse funds, but if you\u2019re setting up an agreement with friends or family, it makes sense to create your own personal loan contract.

            "content": "Find out which lenders offer personal loans after bankruptcy and how to apply Filing for bankruptcy can impact your finances in myriad ways, including your ability to get a credit card or a loan. Still, securing a personal loan after bankruptcy might be possible if you\u2019re flexible with your lender and willing to pay higher interest rates and loan fees. You may also be able to secure the financing you need if you can find a co-signer willing to put their credit on the line to help you. Read on to learn where to find personal loans after bankruptcy and the steps you can take to apply once you\u2019re ready. The type of bankruptcy you filed can affect your ability to qualify for a personal loan and how long the bankruptcy will continue to impact your credit. Chapter 7 bankruptcy involves the liquidation of assets that can be used to settle unpaid debts. However, filers may be able to keep some personal property and real estate depending on their assets and state and federal laws that apply. Also note that some types of debt, including owed child support, most student loans, tax debts, and alimony, typically cannot be discharged during bankruptcy. Chapter 7 bankruptcy stays on your credit report for up to 10 years. Chapter 13 bankruptcy typically allows the filer to keep their personal property, but they must have regular income and agree to a payment plan that pays off their creditors over time. The court system approves the debtor\u2019s payment plan and budget during the process, and a court trustee helps oversee the repayment of unpaid debts from start to finish. Chapter 13 bankruptcy stays on credit reports for seven years after the filing date. Because both of the main types of bankruptcy are listed on credit reports for years after the filing date, going through a bankruptcy can make it difficult to get an auto loan, a mortgage, a credit card, or other types of financing. However, some personal loan companies offer borrowing options that can make post-bankruptcy borrowing a reality. Consider this list of lenders that offer flexible loan terms as well as a greater chance of getting approved with a low credit score and a bankruptcy on your record: If you need to borrow money after bankruptcy, there are a range of important steps that you\u2019ll want to take. Also, be aware that if you can\u2019t quite get approved for the funding you need, you can spend some time improving your credit and waiting things out before you apply. Once you\u2019re ready to move forward with a personal loan, you\u2019ll need to make the following moves. Before you apply for a personal loan on your own, see if you have a trusted family member, partner, or friend with good credit who is willing to be the co-signer on the loan. Having another person willing to co-sign the loan can help you get approved with a better interest rate, which can save money over the long term. However, the co-signer on your loan is legally responsible for repayment if you fail to meet your responsibilities. A late payment on a personal loan with a co-signer can also damage both parties\u2019 credit scores. As a result, it's important to make timely payments. Many online lenders let you pre-qualify or \u201ccheck your rate\u201d online without a hard inquiry on your credit reports. This step can help you figure out the rates and fees you would probably have to pay for a personal loan. It\u2019s also a great way to gauge your approval odds before you apply. Generally speaking, you can pre-qualify for a personal loan online by supplying your: Once you have pre-qualified for a personal loan and have an estimate of your monthly payment, gather your bank statements and other bills to create a budget to determine what you can truly afford. Track your monthly expenses and discretionary spending, like food and entertainment. Ideally, you\u2019ll have enough income to cover all of your monthly bills and enough remaining to cover your new personal loan payment. Any extra cash should be set aside in a savings account. Next, gather the documents needed for your personal loan application, including your SSN, annual income, employment, pay stubs, driver\u2019s license, and potentially your tax returns. The information lenders need from you for the loan process can vary depending on how easily they can verify your identity and income, as well as how long it has been since your bankruptcy filing. Either way, you\u2019ll want to gather all the documents you could potentially need and be willing to send in further documentation and information during the process if the lender requires it. Applying for a personal loan online can be a breeze, particularly if you\u2019ve gathered the information required ahead of time. As you move through the application process, you\u2019ll want to answer all questions thoroughly and honestly. Make sure to list the true reason for the loan, and be honest and forthcoming about your income and employment situation, or lack thereof. Many lenders are able to reach a decision on personal loans within a few hours, whereas others may take a few business days. Once you\u2019ve been approved for a personal loan that suits your needs and goals, you can sign the loan agreement online and from the comfort of your home. From there, you will typically receive funding via an Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfer in your bank account within a few business days. After that, you should prepare to make on-time payments on your loan every month with the goal of improving your credit score and financial health over time. When developing a budget, it's essential to know the difference between your needs and want expenses. Your needs include food, shelter, and health insurance, while your wants might consist of a streaming service, going out to dinner, and expenses that you can live without. Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, to Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures. As you consider options after bankruptcy, you should know about the alternatives to personal loans that could help you get the financing you need. Several different lenders may be able to approve you after bankruptcy, including Avant, LendingClub, OneMain Financial, Upgrade, and Upstart. Most personal loans for borrowers with imperfect credit charge origination fees or administration fees up to 12% of the original loan amount. Also, watch out for prepayment penalties, late fees, and other hidden fees. A co-signer with good credit can help you get approved for a loan. Having a co-signer can also dramatically improve the interest rate and loan terms you can qualify for. Getting a personal loan after bankruptcy can be difficult and expensive. However, there are times when you need to borrow money regardless of the long-term costs. Your best bet when seeking a loan after bankruptcy is to make sure you only borrow what you need and pay the money back as quickly as possible. Also, make sure that you make every payment early or on time and that you use the opportunity to learn positive financial habits to help you avoid financial problems in the future.
