            "content": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Sean Anthony Eddy / Getty Images Index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have revolutionized investing over the past few decades, offering low-cost ways for individuals to gain broad market exposure. While these two investment vehicles share many similarities, they also have key differences that investors should understand. \"By taking a passive, index-based investment approach, an investor can keep fees low while diversifying the portfolio across industries, sectors, and geographies. This results in the investor approximating \u201cuniversal ownership\u201d\u2014that is, owning a representative slice of the entire global economy\u2014and positioning herself to benefit from broad economic growth regardless of the fortunes of individual companies,\" David Tenerelli, a certified financial planner at Strategic Financial Planning in Plano, Texas, told us. Index funds are a broad category that includes both passively managed mutual funds and ETFs. As it happens, the majority of both types of funds are index funds. However, the costs, tax implications, and trading opportunities differ between mutual funds and ETFs. Below, we take you through these differences so you understand these important and, for many, fundamental portfolio investments. Passive investing through index funds has seen tremendous growth in recent years as investors seek low-cost, diversified options to build their portfolios. Index funds track the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500 for large U.S. stocks or the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index for U.S. bonds. The appeal of index funds lies in their simplicity and cost-effectiveness. \"Because there's no original strategy, not much active management is required and so index funds have a lower cost structure than typical mutual funds,\" said Will Thomas, a certified financial planner at the Liberty Group in Washington, DC. By mirroring an index rather than trying to outperform it, these funds have expenses far lower. This and their generally good performance has led to their growing popularity. As of year-end 2023, index mutual funds and ETFs accounted for 48% of assets in long-term funds, up significantly from 19% at year-end 2010. Index mutual funds are priced once daily after the market closes, and investors buy or sell shares directly from the fund company. In contrast, Thomas noted, \"Although they also hold a basket of assets, ETFs are more akin to equities than to mutual funds. Listed on market exchanges just like individual stocks, they are highly liquid: They can be bought and sold like stock shares throughout the trading day, with prices fluctuating constantly.\" Index mutual funds have revolutionized investing since their introduction in the 1970s, offering a low-cost way for investors to gain broad market exposure. These funds aim to replicate the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500 for large U.S. stocks or the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index for bonds. Here are some of their key features: \"Index funds are a low-cost way to track a specific group of investments, which can be more broadly diversified than individual stocks and simpler to buy than each of the individual holdings within the index,\" said Autumn Knutson, founder and lead financial planner at Styled Wealth and an\u00a0Investopedia top-100 financial advisor. \"They are very popular for people looking to invest in a group of investments in a simple and cost-effective way.\" The popularity of index mutual funds has grown significantly over the past decade. As of year-end 2023, index mutual funds held $5.9 trillion in total net assets, representing 30% of long-term mutual fund assets. This growth reflects increasing investor awareness of the impact of fees on long-term returns and skepticism about the ability of active managers to consistently outperform their benchmarks. However, index funds are not without risks. They will fall in value when their target index declines, and they may underperform actively managed funds during certain market conditions. In addition, not all indexes are created equal, and some may be more representative of their target market than others. ETFs are funds that trade on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. They offer investors a way to buy a basket of securities in a single transaction. ETFs can track various assets, including stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies, and can be both actively and passively managed. They account for about 30% of all trading in the U.S. In early 2024, the\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission\u00a0(SEC) approved 11 new spot bitcoin ETFs for trading on American exchanges. In mid-2024, the SEC approved spot ether ETFs for further choices in cryptocurrency ETFs from issuers like VanEck, Grayscale, and Fidelity.  Here are some of the essential features of ETFs: According to the widely followed S&P Indices Versus Active (SPIVA) scorecards, about nine out of 10 actively managed funds didn't match the returns of the S&P 500 benchmark in the past 15 years. Index ETFs were the first type of ETFs to begin trading in the early 1990s in the U.S. They track the performance of a specific market index and run like index mutual funds but with the added benefits of ETF structures. Here are the essential aspects of index ETFs: Index ETFs have seen substantial growth, with total net assets reaching $5.4 trillion at year-end 2023, representing a significant part of the ETF market. The SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), launched in 1993 to track the S&P 500 Index, is the oldest surviving and largest ETF with annual returns of 8.21% since 2000. The significant difference between index funds and ETFs is how you buy shares in them and their flexibility. Index mutual funds can only be bought and sold at the end of the trading day, based on the fund's net asset value (NAV). ETFs trade throughout the day on a stock exchange, just like stocks, and their price fluctuates based on supply and demand. What this means is that with index mutual funds, your trades are priced at the end of the day based on the total value of the fund's holdings at that time. But with ETFs, your price reflects real-time supply and demand. They also differ in cost. There are typically no shareholder transaction costs for mutual funds. Management fees tend to be lower for ETFs. Index ETFs tend to be more tax-efficient than index mutual funds because of how they are structured. ETFs generally use an \"in-kind\" creation and redemption process, which minimizes capital gains distributions that would otherwise trigger tax events. Meanwhile, mutual funds may generate capital gains when the fund manager has to sell holdings to meet redemptions, potentially leading to a tax liability for investors even if they haven't sold their shares. Another distinction lies in investment minimums and transaction costs. Index mutual funds often have a minimum investment requirement, which can be a barrier for some investors, though these are typically dropped if you are investing through your paycheck. Index ETFs, meanwhile, typically do not have minimums, as you can purchase as little as one share, making them more accessible. However, while ETFs might offer lower expense ratios than mutual funds, buying and selling them could incur trading fees depending on your brokerage. In contrast, many index mutual funds can be bought directly from the issuer without commissions. Liquidity also distinguishes index funds from ETFs. Since index mutual funds are bought and sold at the end of the trading day, liquidity is not as readily available as with ETFs. Trading mechanism: NAV (end of day) Minimum investment: Variable Taxation: May incur capital gains tax Fees: Lower expense ratios (average of 0.06% for equity funds in 2023) Trading Flexibility: Limited (end of day) Trading mechanism: Stock exchanges (intraday) Minimum investment: Lower (may include fractional shares) Taxation: More tax-efficient Fees: Lower expense ratios (as low as 0.03% for some large funds Trading flexibility: Trade throughout the day The returns of ETFs and index funds are generally very similar when they track the same index, as both aim to replicate the performance of their benchmark. Any differences in returns are usually minimal and often come down to tracking error, expenses, and how dividends are handled. ETFs might have a slight advantage in that they can be more tax-efficient due to their creation/redemption process, potentially leading to fewer capital gains distributions. ETFs and index funds can offer similar levels of safety when they track broad market indexes. The key factor is diversification, which both types of funds provide by holding a basket of securities. This spread of investments helps reduce risk compared with owning individual stocks. The safety of any investment depends on the specific assets it holds. A broadly diversified S&P 500 ETF or index fund would generally be considered safer than a narrowly focused sector fund of either type. Index funds and individual stocks serve different purposes and have distinct risk-return profiles. Index funds offer instant diversification by holding a basket of stocks, which can help reduce risk. They also provide a simple way to match market returns without the need for extensive research or stock-picking skills. For many investors, especially those who don't have the time or expertise to analyze individual companies, index funds can be a better choice. However, individual stocks can offer higher returns for investors willing to take on more risk and do thorough research. Both index mutual funds and ETFs can provide investors with broad, diversified exposure to the stock market, making them good long-term investments suitable for most investors. ETFs may be more accessible and easier to trade for retail investors because they trade like shares of stock on exchanges. They also tend to have lower fees and are more tax-efficient.

            "title": "7 Best ETF Trading Strategies for Beginners",
            "content": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are ideal for beginning investors due to their many benefits, which include low expense ratios, instant diversification, and a multitude of investment choices. Unlike some mutual funds, they also tend to have low investing thresholds, so you don't have to be ultra-rich to get started. Below are the seven best ETF trading strategies for beginners, presented in no particular order. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) requires buying a set fixed-dollar amount of an asset on a regular schedule, regardless of the changing cost of the asset.\u00a0Instead of chasing the market, these investors build a position in a stock. Over time, the average cost of their investment proves to be competitive. This is a smart strategy for beginner investors, who may be young people in first jobs with a modest sum to invest each month. They'd be better off investing it in an ETF or more than one ETF rather than putting it in a low-interest savings account. DCA reduces risk and shields the investor from market volatility. By consistently purchasing assets at various price points, it minimizes the impact of short-term market fluctuations on overall investment performance. The most popular ETFs are stock funds, but many ETFs invest in bonds, commodities, currencies, and real estate. Since January 2024, there have even been bitcoin futures ETFs. There are two major advantages of periodic investing for beginners. The first is that it imparts discipline to the savings process. As many financial planners recommend, it makes eminent sense to pay yourself first, which is what you achieve by saving regularly. The second advantage is simple: You'll make more money. By investing the same dollar amount in an ETF every month you will accumulate more units at a low price and fewer units at a high price. Over time, this approach can pay off handsomely, as long as you stick to it. Asset allocation means dividing your investments into broad categories, such as stocks, bonds, and cash, to minimize the impact of a real downturn in one of them. The low investment threshold for most ETFs makes it easy for a beginner to implement a basic asset allocation strategy that matches their investment time horizon and risk tolerance. For example, young investors might be 100% invested in equity ETFs when they are in their 20s. In the long term, they should get the highest return, and in the short term, they can wait out any reverses. As these same investors reach their 30s they may be looking forward to major changes such as starting a family and buying a house. They would do well to shift to a less aggressive investment mix such as 60% in equities ETFs and 40% in bond ETFs.\u00a0This way, a major downturn in the stock market won't disrupt their lives. Many ETFs are naturally structured to be diversified. For example, an ETF that tracks a broad market index, such as the S&P 500, would hold a basket of stocks representing a diverse range of companies from various sectors. However, it's important to note that not all ETFs are diversified. For instance, some ETFs track a specific industry like technology or energy. A downturn in a whole sector is not unknown. Swing trades seek to exploit sizeable price changes in stocks or other assets like currencies or commodities. Unlike day trades, they can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to work out. The attributes of ETFs that make them suitable for swing trading are their diversification and tight bid/ask spreads. Moreover, ETFs are available for many different investment classes and a wide range of sectors, so a beginner can choose an ETF that is based on a sector or asset class where they have some expertise or knowledge. For example, someone with a technology background may have an advantage in trading a technology ETF like the Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index. A novice trader who closely tracks the commodity markets may prefer to trade one of the many commodity ETFs, such as the Invesco DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC). Because ETFs are typically baskets of stocks or other assets, their prices tend not to jump as wildly as single stocks in a bull market. By the same token, they are less susceptible to a sharp drop. Spotting the big economic trends and acting on them is relatively easy for ETF investors. This is sector rotation, which is adjusting a portfolio to take advantage of a new stage in the economic cycle. For example, assume an investor has been invested in the biotechnology sector through the iShares Biotechnology ETF (IBB). If it looks like an economic slowdown is coming, the investor might decide to take profits in this ETF and put it in a defensive sector such as consumer staples\u00a0via The\u00a0Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR\u00a0Fund (XLP). Keep in mind that there are risks to sector rotation. Success hinges on market timing, and economic cycles are not easy for even economists to predict. Frequent trading also can incur high transaction costs and trigger tax implications, particularly with short-term capital gains taxes. Short selling means selling a stock or other asset that has been borrowed. The investor makes money if the asset declines in value, or owes money if it gains. This is just as risky as it sounds. However, short-selling ETFs is slightly less risky than shorting individual stocks because of the low risk of a short squeeze in an ETF. That is a trading scenario in which an asset that has been heavily shorted spikes higher, forcing short sellers to take a loss. Beginners, and individual investors in general, should stay away from double-leveraged or triple-leveraged inverse ETFs,\u00a0which seek results equal to two or three times the inverse of the one-day price change in an index. High risk is inherent in these ETFs. ETFs are good tools for capitalizing on seasonal trends. Consider two well-known seasonal trends. The first one is called the sell in May and go away phenomenon. U.S. equities historically underperform over the six-month May-October period compared with the November-April period. The other seasonal trend is the tendency of gold to gain in September and October, thanks to strong demand from India ahead of the wedding season and the\u00a0Diwali festival of lights. The broad market weakness trend can be exploited by shorting the SPDR S&P 500 ETF around the end of April or the beginning of May and closing out the short position in late October, right after the market swoons typical of that month have occurred. A beginner can similarly take advantage of seasonal gold strength by buying units of a popular gold ETF, like the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), in late summer and closing out the position after a couple of months. Note that seasonal trends do not always occur as predicted. Stop-loss orders are a wise move. A beginner may occasionally need to hedge or protect against downside risk in a substantial portfolio, perhaps one that has been acquired as an inheritance. Suppose you have inherited a sizeable portfolio of U.S. blue chips and are concerned about the risk of a large decline in U.S. equities. One solution is to buy put options. However,\u00a0since most beginners are not familiar with option trading strategies, an alternate strategy is to initiate a short position in broad market ETFs like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF or the SPDR\u00a0Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA). If the market declines as expected, your blue-chip equity position will be hedged effectively since declines in your portfolio will be offset by gains in the short ETF position. Note that your gains would also be capped if the market rises since gains in your portfolio will be offset by losses in the short ETF position. Nevertheless, ETFs offer beginners a relatively easy and efficient method of hedging. While many ETFs are designed to be diversified, focusing on a broad market index, others may concentrate on specific sectors or themes, leading to variations in diversification. It's essential for investors to understand an ETF's underlying holdings and investment objective to assess its level of diversification. The primary role of ETFs is to track the performance of a specific index, and this process is known as index tracking. ETFs use a passive management approach, aiming to replicate the returns of the index they follow. Tax implications of ETF investing depend on factors such as capital gains distributions, capital gains taxes upon selling, and tax efficiency. Additionally, investors can control the timing of capital gains recognition by choosing when to sell ETF shares and in what investment vehicles to hold ETFs in. ETFs can be used for both short-term and long-term investment strategies, depending on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. For short-term strategies, investors might use ETFs for tactical asset allocation or to capitalize on specific market trends. Long-term investors, on the other hand, may use ETFs as core building blocks within a diversified portfolio. The basic strategies used by stock investors are easily adapted to exchange-traded funds. Some may work better since ETFs are by definition more diversified and less volatile than individual stocks. If you're a beginning investor, start by considering what your financial goals are and what level of risk you can tolerate. Then decide how much you can afford to invest each month. Finally, pick the ETF or two or more ETFs that can get you where you want to go.

            "title": "10 ETF Concerns That Investors Shouldn\u2019t Overlook",
            "content": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).  Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be a great investment vehicle for small and large investors alike. These popular funds, which are similar to mutual funds but trade like stocks, have become a popular choice among investors looking to broaden the diversity of their portfolios without increasing the time and effort that they have to spend managing and allocating their investments. ETFs represent ownership in a basket of stocks or bonds. The value of an ETF can appreciate if the underlying assets appreciate. In addition, investments that incur cash flow such as interest or dividends may automatically be reinvested into the fund. However, investors need to be aware of some disadvantages before jumping into the world of ETFs. One of the biggest advantages of\u00a0ETFs is that they trade like stocks. An ETF invests in a portfolio of separate companies, typically linked by a common sector or theme. Investors simply buy the ETF to reap the benefits of investing in that larger portfolio all at once. As a result of the stock-like nature of ETFs, investors can buy and sell during market hours, as well as enter advanced orders on the purchase, such as limits and stops. Conversely, a typical mutual fund purchase is made after the market closes, once the net asset value of the fund is calculated. Every time you buy or sell a stock, you might pay a commission. This is also the case when it comes to buying and selling ETFs. Depending on how often you trade an ETF, trading fees can quickly add up and reduce your investment\u2019s performance. No-load mutual funds, on the other hand, are sold without a commission or sales charge\u2014making them relatively advantageous,\u00a0in this regard, vs. ETFs. It is important to be aware of trading fees when comparing an investment in ETFs with a similar investment in a mutual fund. Many online brokers today offer zero-commission trading in stocks and ETFs. Note, however, that you may still pay a hidden commission in the form of payment for order flow (PFOF). This controversial practice routes your orders to a specific counterparty rather than having the market compete for your order at the best price possible. If you are deciding between similar ETFs and mutual funds, be aware of the different fee structures of each, including the trading fees that may be generated inside of actively managed ETFs. And remember, actively trading ETFs, as with stocks, can reduce your investment performance with commissions quickly piling up. Every ETF will also come with an expense ratio. The expense ratio is a measure of what percentage of a fund\u2019s total assets are required to cover various operating expenses each year. While this is not exactly the same as a fee that an investor pays to the fund, it has a similar effect: The higher the expense ratio, the lower the total returns will be for investors. ETFs are known for having very low expense ratios relative to many other investment vehicles, but they are still a factor to consider, especially when comparing otherwise similar ETFs. ETFs, like mutual funds, are often lauded for the diversification that they offer investors. However, it is important to note that just because an ETF contains more than one underlying position doesn\u2019t mean that it is immune to volatility. The potential for large swings will mainly depend on the scope of the fund. An ETF that tracks a broad market index such as the S&P 500 is likely to be less volatile than an ETF that tracks a specific industry or sector, such as an oil services ETF. Therefore, it is vital to be aware of the fund\u2019s focus and what types of investments it includes. As ETFs have continued to grow increasingly specific along with the solidification and popularization of the industry, this has become even more of a concern. In the case of international or global ETFs, the fundamentals of the country that the ETF is following are important, as is the creditworthiness of the currency in that country. Economic and social instability will also play a huge role in determining the success of any ETF that invests in a particular country or region. These factors must be kept in mind when making decisions regarding the viability of an ETF. The rule here is to know what the ETF is tracking and understand the underlying risks associated with it. Don\u2019t be lulled into thinking that all ETFs are the same just because some offer low volatility. Tracking error measures how closely an index ETF tracks its benchmark index. Those with larger tracking errors may come with hidden risks. A big factor in trading an ETF,\u00a0a stock,\u00a0or anything else that is traded publicly is liquidity. Liquidity means that when you buy something, there is enough trading interest that you will be able to get out of it relatively quickly without moving the price. If an ETF is thinly traded, there can be problems getting out of the investment, depending on the size of your position relative to the average trading volume. The biggest sign of an illiquid investment is large spreads between the bid and the ask. You need to make sure that an ETF is liquid before buying it, and the best way to do this is to study the spreads and the market movements over a week or month. The rule here is to make sure that the ETF in which you are interested does not have large spreads between the bid and ask prices. Tighter spreads equal greater liquidity, and that corresponds with less risk in entering and exiting your trades. In some cases, an ETF will distribute capital gains to shareholders. This is not always desirable for ETF holders, as shareholders are responsible for paying the capital gains tax. It is usually better if the fund retains the capital gains and invests them, rather than distributing them and creating a tax liability for the investor. Investors will usually want to reinvest those capital gains distributions; to do this, they will need to go back to their brokers to buy more shares, which creates new fees. Because different ETFs treat capital gains distributions in various ways, it can be a challenge for investors to stay apprised of the funds in which they take part. It\u2019s also crucial for an investor to learn about how an ETF treats capital gains distributions before investing in that fund. Say you have $5,000 or $10,000 to invest in an index ETF (such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) but are not sure how to invest: in a lump sum or by dollar-cost averaging. Due to the proliferation of no-fee ETFs, broker commissions are no longer as important a factor as they once were. Lump-sum investing means that you can put your entire investment to work right away. This is great in a rising market, but perhaps not optimal if the market looks like it is peaking or is unusually volatile. With dollar-cost averaging, you spread the $5,000 or $10,000 across equal monthly investments. This strategy works well if the market declines or is choppy, but it does have an opportunity cost if the market rises when only part of your money has been invested. And even small commissions can add up over multiple buy orders unless your brokerage does not charge commissions. When it comes to risk considerations, many investors opt for ETFs because they feel that they are less risky than other modes of investment. We\u2019ve already addressed the issues of volatility above, but it\u2019s important to recognize that certain classes of ETFs are significantly riskier investments than others. Leveraged ETFs are a good example. These ETFs tend to experience value decay as time goes on and due to daily resets. This can happen even as an underlying index is thriving. Many analysts caution investors against buying leveraged ETFs at all. Investors who do take this approach should watch their investments carefully and mind the risks. Some ETFs are also inverse, in that they move in the opposite direction of their reference or benchmark. Leveraged inverse ETFs can return negative 2x or 3x the benchmark. Because of how they are structured, inverse ETFs decay in value over time. Because they look similar on the page, ETFs and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) are often confused with each other. However, investors should remember that these are very different investment vehicles. ETNs may also have a stated strategy, track an underlying index of commodities or stocks, and require fees, among other features. Nonetheless, ETNs tend to have a different set of risks from ETFs. ETNs face the risk of the solvency of an issuing company. If an issuing bank for an ETN defaults, or worse, declares bankruptcy, then investors are often out of luck. It\u2019s a different risk from those associated with ETFs, and it\u2019s something that investors eager to jump on board the ETF trend may not be aware of. An investor who buys shares in a pool of different individual stocks has more flexibility than one who buys the same group of stocks in an ETF. One way that this disadvantages the ETF investor is in their ability to control tax-loss harvesting. If the price of a stock goes down, an investor can sell shares at a loss, thereby reducing total capital gains and taxable income to a certain extent. Investors holding the same stock through an ETF don\u2019t have the same luxury\u2014the ETF determines when to adjust its portfolio, and the investor has to buy or sell an entire lot of stocks, rather than individual names. Like stocks, the price of an ETF can sometimes be different from that ETF\u2019s underlying value. This can lead to situations in which an investor might actually pay a premium above and beyond the cost of the underlying stocks or commodities in an ETF portfolio just to buy that ETF. This is uncommon and is typically corrected over time, but it\u2019s important to recognize as a risk that one takes when buying or selling an ETF. Check an ETF\u2019s disparity against its net asset value (NAV) for irregularities. If it is consistently trading differently from its NAV in the market, something fishy may be going on. One of the same reasons why ETFs appeal to many investors also can be seen as a limitation of the industry. Investors typically do not have a say in the individual stocks in an ETF\u2019s underlying index. This means that an investor looking to avoid a particular company or industry for a reason such as moral conflict does not have the same level of control as an investor focused on individual stocks. An ETF investor does not have to take the time to select the individual stocks making up the portfolio; on the other hand, the investor cannot exclude stocks without eliminating their investment in the entire ETF. While it\u2019s not a flaw in the same sense as some of the previously mentioned items, investors should go into ETF investing with an accurate idea of what to expect from the performance. ETFs are most often linked to a benchmarking index, meaning that they are often not designed to outperform that index. Investors looking for this type of outperformance (which also, of course, carries added risks) should perhaps look to other opportunities. Liquidity is an important consideration in exchange-traded fund (ETF) investing. ETFs have differing liquidity profiles for many reasons. Investing in an ETF with relatively low liquidity may cost you in terms of a wider bid-ask spread, reduced opportunity to trade profitably, and\u2014in extreme cases\u2014an inability to withdraw funds in certain situations like a big market crash. ETFs are baskets of stocks or securities, but although this means that they are generally well diversified, some ETFs invest in very risky sectors or employ higher-risk strategies, such as leverage. For example, a leveraged ETF that tracks commodity prices may well be more volatile and hence riskier than a stable blue chip. An ETF\u2019s tracking error is the difference between its returns and those of its underlying benchmark index. Tracking errors are generally small, and the largest, widely held ETFs have minimal tracking errors. Inverse and leveraged ETFs often use derivatives contracts like options and short-term forwards to achieve their stated goals. These types of instruments have inherent time decay, and they tend to lose value over time as a result, regardless of what happens in the index or benchmark that the ETF tracks. As a result, these products are only intended for day traders or others with very short holding periods. Now that you know the risks that come with ETFs, you can make better investment decisions. ETFs have seen spectacular growth in popularity, and in many cases, this popularity is well deserved. But like all good things, ETFs also have their drawbacks. Making sound investment decisions requires knowing all of the facts about a particular investment vehicle, and ETFs are no different. Knowing the disadvantages will help steer you away from potential pitfalls and, if all goes well, toward tidy profits.

            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). An exchange-traded fund is an investment vehicle that pools a group of securities into a fund. It can be traded like an individual stock on an exchange. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a pooled investment security that can be bought and sold like an individual stock. ETFs can be structured to track anything from the price of a commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities. ETFs can even be designed to track specific investment strategies. Various types of ETFs are available to investors for income generation, speculation, and price increases, and to hedge or partly offset risk in an investor\u2019s portfolio. The first ETF was the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 Index. Investopedia / Zoe Hansen An ETF must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the United States, most ETFs are set up as open-ended funds and are subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, except where subsequent rules have modified their regulatory requirements. Open-end funds do not limit the number of investors involved in the product. Vanguard's Consumer Staples ETF (VDC) tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Staples 25/50 Index and has a minimum investment of $1.00. The fund holds shares of all 104 companies on the index, some familiar to most because they produce or sell consumer items. A few of the companies held by VDC are Proctor & Gamble, Costco, Coca-Cola, Walmart, and PepsiCo. Investors who buy $1.00 in VDC own $1.00 shares representing 104 companies. There is no transfer of ownership because investors buy a share of the fund, which owns the shares of the underlying companies. Unlike mutual funds, ETF share prices are determined throughout the day. A mutual fund trades only once a day after market close. Volatile stock performance is curtailed in an ETF because they do not involve direct ownership of securities. Industry ETFs are also used to rotate in and out of sectors during economic cycles. As of January 2024, nine ETFs focus on companies engaged in gold mining, excluding inverse, leveraged, and funds with low assets under management (AUM). Access to many stocks across various industries Low expense ratios and fewer broker commissions Risk management through diversification ETFs exist that focus on targeted industries Actively managed ETFs have higher fees Single-industry-focused ETFs limit diversification Lack of liquidity hinders transactions ETFs trade through online brokers and traditional broker-dealers. Many sources provide pre-screened brokers in the ETF industry. Individuals can also purchase ETFs in their retirement accounts. An alternative to standard brokers is a robo-advisor like Betterment and Wealthfront.An ETF\u2019s expense ratio is the cost to operate and manage the fund. ETFs typically have low expenses because they track an index. ETFs are available on most online investing platforms, retirement account provider sites, and investing apps like Robinhood. Most of these platforms offer commission-free trading, meaning that investors don\u2019t have to pay fees to the platform providers to buy or sell ETFs. After creating and funding a brokerage account, investors can search for ETFs and make their chosen buys and sells. One of the best ways to narrow ETF options is to utilize an ETF screening tool with criteria such as trading volume, expense ratio, past performance, holdings, and commission costs. Order a copy of Investopedia's What To Do With $10,000 for more wealth-building advice. Below are examples of popular ETFs on the market. Some ETFs track an index of stocks, thus creating a broad portfolio, while others target specific industries. Most stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds can be bought and sold without a commission. Funds and ETFs differ from stocks because of the management fees that most of them carry, though they have been trending lower for many years. In general, ETFs tend to have lower average fees than mutual funds. Though ETFs allow investors to gain as stock prices rise and fall, they also benefit from companies that pay dividends. Dividends are a portion of earnings allocated or paid by companies to investors for holding their stock. ETF shareholders are entitled to a proportion of the profits, such as earned interest or dividends paid, and may get a residual value if the fund is liquidated. An ETF is more tax-efficient than a mutual fund because most buying and selling occur through an exchange, and the ETF sponsor does not need to redeem shares each time an investor wishes to sell or issue new shares each time an investor wishes to buy. Redeeming shares of a fund can trigger a tax liability, so listing the shares on an exchange can keep tax costs lower. In the case of a mutual fund, each time an investor sells their shares, they sell it back to the fund and incur a tax liability that must be paid by the shareholders of the fund. The supply of ETF shares is regulated through creation and redemption, which involves large specialized investors called\u00a0authorized participants (APs). When an ETF wants to issue additional shares, the AP buys shares of the stocks from the index\u2014such as the S&P 500 tracked by the fund\u2014and sells or exchanges them to the ETF for new ETF shares at an equal value. In turn, the AP sells the ETF shares in the market for a profit. When an AP sells stocks to the ETF sponsor in return for shares in the ETF, the block of shares used in the transaction is called a\u00a0creation unit. If an ETF closes with a share price of $101 and the value of the stocks that the ETF owns is only worth $100 on a per-share basis, then the fund\u2019s price of $101 was traded at a premium to the fund\u2019s net asset value (NAV). The NAV is an accounting mechanism that determines the overall value of the assets or stocks in an ETF. Conversely, an AP also buys shares of the ETF on the open market. The AP then sells these shares back to the ETF sponsor in exchange for individual stock shares that the AP can sell on the open market. As a result, the number of ETF shares is reduced through the process called redemption. The amount of redemption and creation activity is a function of demand in the market and whether the ETF is trading at a discount or premium to the value of the fund\u2019s assets. The U.K. ETF market is one of the largest and most diverse in Europe, with ETFs listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) that offer exposure to various asset classes and markets, including equities, fixed income, commodities, currencies, real estate, and alternative investments. Buying ETFs in the U.K. allows inclusion in Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), which are tax-efficient savings vehicles that allow investors to invest up to \u00a320,000 per year without paying any income or capital gains tax on their returns. Another benefit is that ETFs attract no stamp duty, which is a tax levied on ordinary share transactions in the U.K. U.K. investors can buy shares in U.S.-listed companies from the U.K., but due to local and European regulations,\u00a0you're not allowed to purchase U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.K. There are U.K.-based ETFs that track U.S. markets, as long as it has the 'UCITS' moniker in the name. This means the fund is fully regulated in the U.K. and allowed to track U.S. investments.For broad-based exposure to U.K. equities, there are several UCITS ETFs that track the FTSE 100 index, \u00a0which consists of the 100 largest publicly listed companies in the country. The HSBC FTSE UCITS ETF is listed on the London Stock Exchange and trades under the ticker symbol HUKX. The ETF has an ongoing charge of 0.07% and a dividend yield of 3.62% as of January 2024. The distinction of being the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) is often given to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) launched by State Street Global Advisors on Jan. 22, 1993. There were, however, some precursors to the SPY, notably securities called Index Participation Units listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) that tracked the Toronto 35 Index that appeared in 1990. An index fund usually refers to a mutual fund that tracks an index. An index ETF is constructed in much the same way and will hold the stocks of an index, tracking it. However, the difference between an index fund and an ETF is that an ETF tends to be more cost-effective and liquid than an index mutual fund. You can also buy an ETF from a broker who will execute the trade throughout the trading day, while a mutual fund trades via a broker only at the close of each trading day. Nearly all ETFs provide diversification benefits relative to an individual stock purchase. Still, some ETFs are highly concentrated\u2014either in the number of different securities they hold or in the weighting of those securities. For example, a fund that concentrates half of its assets in two or three positions may offer less diversification than a fund with fewer total portfolio constituents but broader asset distribution. Exchange-traded funds represent a cost-effective way to gain exposure to a broad basket of securities with a limited budget. Investors can build a portfolio that holds one, many, or only ETFs. Instead of buying individual stocks, investors buy shares of a fund that targets a representative cross-section of the wider market. However, there are some additional expenses to keep in mind when investing in an ETF.

            "title": "8 Best Funds for Regular Dividend Income",
            "content": "Reinvestment is known to increase long-term returns. When you reinvest your money, the interim income you generate is put back into the investment. But some investors opt to receive periodic payments from their investments, depending on their specific needs. Periodic\u00a0coupon\u00a0or interest payments from bonds, which are debt instruments, and regular dividends, which are cash payments from stocks and mutual funds, can offer investors a steady stream of income. In this article, we explore eight of the best dividend mutual funds that regularly pay dividends regularly. Mutual funds often contain a basket of securities including equities or stocks, which may pay dividends. Dividends are paid to shareholders at different times. For instance, mutual funds that follow a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) reinvest the received dividend amount back into the stocks. Other funds follow the dividend payment plan by continuing to aggregate dividend income over a monthly, quarterly, or sometimes six-month period, then making a periodic dividend payment to account holders. A fund pays income after expenses. If a fund gets a regular yield from the dividend-paying constituent stocks, those expenses can be covered fully or partially by dividend income. Depending on local laws, dividend income may be tax-free, which can add to an investor\u2019s overall return. Investors should also note that companies are not obliged to make dividend payments on their stocks, meaning that dividends are not guaranteed. Investors looking for dividend income may find dividend-paying mutual funds a better bet than individual stocks, as the latter aggregates the available dividend income from multiple stocks. A mutual fund also helps with diversifying risk from depreciating stock prices since the invested money is spread among dozens of companies. Here are the best mutual funds that pay high-dividend yields. A useful benchmark for gauging the dividend-paying performance of a fund is to compare the\u00a0mutual fund yield\u00a0with the yield of the benchmark S&P 500 index. The 30-day SEC yield is a standard measurement in the industry mandated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to help investors compare funds before investing.  Vanguard's High Dividend Yield Index Admiral Shares is an index fund that attempts to replicate the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index. This index contains stocks of companies that usually pay higher-than-expected or greater-than-average dividends. Being an index fund, VHYAX replicates the benchmark stock constituents in the same proportion. This fund has maintained a consistent history of paying quarterly dividends since its inception on Feb. 7, 2019. Being an index fund, the VHYAX has one of the lowest expense ratios\u20140.08%, as of Feb. 27, 2023\u2014and its SEC yield was 3.06%, as of July 31, 2023. The fund has a $3,000 minimum investment requirement. It may be a perfect low-cost fund for anyone looking for higher-than-average dividend income. For investors looking for a lower minimum investment requirement, Vanguard offers this fund as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), which has many similar characteristics. The ETF version is called the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM). The VDADX is an index fund, which attempts to replicate the performance of the benchmark Nasdaq US Dividend Achievers Select Index. This unique index consists of stocks that have been increasing their dividend payouts over time. Being an index fund, the VDADX replicates the benchmark stock constituents in the same proportion. This fund is also a consistent payer of quarterly dividends since its inception date of Dec. 19, 2013. VDADX also has one of the lowest expense ratios. Like VHYAX, it only charges 0.08% as an expense ratio with an SEC yield of 1.76%, as of July 31, 2023. The fund has a $3,000 minimum investment requirement. For investors looking for a lower minimum investment requirement, Vanguard offers this fund as an ETF, which has many similar characteristics. The ETF version is called the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG). Columbia Threadneedle Investments\u2019 Dividend Opportunity Fund focuses on delivering dividends by investing in the stocks of companies that have historically paid consistent and increasing dividends. The fund offers a diversified portfolio of holdings that include common stocks, preferred stocks, and derivatives for both U.S. and foreign securities of various-sized companies. INUTX has an expense ratio of 1.06%, and an SEC yield of 2.30%, as of June 30, 2023. The fund\u2019s inception date was Aug. 1, 1988, and it has a $2,000 minimum investment requirement. The Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund primarily invests in a diversified portfolio of\u00a0large-cap\u00a0(and occasionally\u00a0midcap) U.S. and global companies that are undervalued relative to the market and have the potential for paying dividends regularly. The fund research attempts to identify companies that have high earnings growth potential leading to more income, as well as the willingness of company management to increase dividend payouts. VDIGX has an expense ratio of 0.30% and an SEC yield of 1.58%, as of July 31, 2023. The fund\u2019s inception date was May 15, 1992, and it has a $3,000 minimum investment requirement. Any fund that invests in stocks, bonds, or other securities can realize gains in losses due to the price movements of the holdings. Although the market gains can lead to enhanced capital gains in addition to the SEC yield, market losses can also occur. These losses can be so significant that not only can the SEC yield be wiped out, but a loss of the initial investment is also possible. Based on the principle that increasing dividends over a period are positive indicators of a company\u2019s financial health and growth, the T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund looks to invest mostly in stocks of large companies, with some midsized companies folded into the mix. The fund seeks companies that have a strong track record of paying dividends or that are expected to increase their dividends over time. PRDGX contains mostly stocks of large U.S. companies that pay quarterly dividends. It has an expense ratio of 0.64%. The fund\u2019s inception date was Dec. 30, 1992, and it has a $2,500 minimum initial investment requirement. For investors who are not satisfied with quarterly dividends, the Strategic Value Dividend Fund from Federated Hermes offers monthly dividends. The fund\u2019s investment strategy includes generating income and long-term capital appreciation by focusing on higher-dividend-paying stocks than that of the broader equity market. The fund also seeks out companies with dividend growth potential, and the fund is primarily benchmarked to the Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index. SVAAX contains mostly stocks of large U.S. companies, with some foreign securities. It has a net expense ratio of 1.06% and an SEC yield of 3.77%, as of June 30, 2023. The fund\u2019s inception date was March 30, 2005, and it has a $1,500 minimum initial investment requirement. The Vanguard Equity Income Fund Investor Shares focuses primarily on established U.S. companies that are consistent dividend payers. The fund\u2019s holdings tend to be slow-growth but high-yield companies. As a result, the stock price gains may be limited compared with other funds. VEIPX pays regular quarterly dividends and has an inception date of March 21, 1988. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.28% and an SEC yield of 2.62%, as of July 31, 2023. The fund requires a minimum investment of $3,000. The Neuberger Berman Equity Income Fund looks to earn dividend income and capital appreciation by investing in high-dividend-paying equities that include common stocks, utilities,\u00a0real estate investment trusts (REITs),\u00a0convertible preferred stock, convertible securities such as bonds, and derivative instruments like call and put options. The fund\u2019s inception date was June 9, 2008. It has a $1,000 minimum initial investment requirement. It pays dividends with an SEC yield of 2.22%, as of June 30, 2023, and has an expense ratio of 0.71%. Dividend-paying mutual funds give investors a chance to put their money into an investment vehicle the tends to perform well. They tend to offer great returns and low volatility while allowing investors to diversify their holdings. Dividend-paying companies that make up a mutual fund portfolio provide investors with a steady income stream and capital appreciation. But there are fees and initial investment minimums that investors should keep an eye on before purchasing shares. A DRIP is an investment plan. Known as a dividend reinvestment plan, it allows people who receive dividends to use them to purchase more stock in the company. This allows the investor's investment in the company to grow over time. A dividend is a distribution made by a company to its shareholders\u2014normally common shareholders. It represents a portion of the company's earnings. Dividends are distributed on a regular basis. They are most commonly paid quarterly, monthly, or annually. Recipients can take dividends as cash or they can reinvest them back into the company. Not all companies pay their shareholders a dividend. In fact, they are usually offered by more established corporations. A company\u2019s dividend payments are typically paid from the company\u2019s retained earnings, which represent the saved profit from prior years. However, companies may be better off reinvesting the dividend money back in the business, leading to higher revenue and an appreciation of their stock prices. Also, dividend payments limit the reinvestment gains due to compounding. Investors looking for regular dividend income should weigh both the benefits and the limitations of dividend income before investing in high-dividend-paying mutual funds.

Silas Stein / Getty Images The S&P 500 index has long been a cornerstone of many investment portfolios, offering a blend of diversification, historical stability, and long-term potential for growth. As the S&P 500 continues to deliver a strong performance, reaching all-time highs, some investors wonder if now is a good time to invest in S&P 500 exchange-traded funds (ETFs). But what if you're concerned you don't have enough to invest? You can start small. This article explores the potential returns of investing just $50 per month in an S&P 500 ETF over 20 years, demonstrating how consistent investments can grow significantly over time. To understand the potential of investing in the S&P 500, it's good to review its historical performance. Since its formation in the 1920s, the S&P has returned a consistent average annualized return of just over 10%. As of Nov. 14, 2024, the S&P 500 index has grown 25.48% year-to-date. Here are its current returns: This doesn't mean that the index always goes up\u2014in fact, during years with recessions and bear markets, the index has lost value. Still, the S&P 500 has demonstrated remarkable consistency and growth over long periods. In the table below, we adjusted the index's annual returns for inflation, giving you the real returns for each year since 1950. Let's now turn to our scenario: You'll invest $50 per month (a total of $600 per year) in an S&P 500 ETF for the next 20 years. ETFs are like mutual funds, except you can trade shares in them like you would trade any stock in a brokerage account. While most people say for simplicity's sake that they are investing in the S&P 500, they're really investing in an ETF that's mirroring the companies in the index and their relative sizes. As such, your $50 is buying a share of all 500 of the country's most successful companies, from Apple (AAPL) to Amazon (AMZN) to Coca-Cola (KO). Investing a fixed amount, like $50 every month, can be one of the smartest ways to build wealth over time. When you invest the same amount monthly, you naturally buy more shares when prices are low and fewer when they're high\u2014like automatically getting better deals without trying to time the market. This strategy, known as dollar-cost averaging (DCA), takes the guesswork out of knowing when to invest. Here are the most popular S&P 500 ETFs by the amount invested in them: Based on the S&P 500's historical performance of about 10% annual returns (before inflation), here's what could happen to your monthly $50 investment: At first, the changes seem small, but over time, your money starts to pick up speed. This happens because you're earning returns not just on your $50 deposits but also on all the previous earnings\u2014what investors call \"compound growth.\" Using a compound interest calculator, we find that after 20 years, your total investment could grow to about $43,700. This breaks down as follows: This calculation doesn't account for taxes, fees, commissions, or inflation, which would cut the real-world purchasing power of your returns. Below, we accounted for inflation, taxes, ETF fees, and dividends you would have received in the past 20 years. You can hover over the chart to see specific changes in your investment's value over time. These projections are based on historical averages. Some years were better, some worse. The key is staying consistent with your $50 investment regardless of what the market does in any given year. Investing $50 per month in an S&P 500 ETF over 20 years can grow into a significant sum\u2014potentially over $40,000\u2014thanks to the power of compound interest and the historical performance of the index. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, the S&P 500's track record of long-term growth and diversification makes it an attractive option for many investors. Any investment strategy you choose should align with your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to determine the best approach for your individual circumstances. Whether you're just starting with $50 a month or have more to invest, the key is to begin early and remain consistent over time.

Exchange-traded products (ETPs) offer investors diversity and liquidity through pooled investments that trade on stock exchanges, akin to individual stocks. But ETPs are not stocks; they are sophisticated financial instruments that can pool a variety of investment types, including funds and commodities, traded like stocks. Among ETPs, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are the best known, and offer flexibility, cost efficiency, and comparatively lower fees. ETFs often mirror the performance of indexes, sectors, or commodities prices, providing a transparent and effective way to invest in entire markets or specific economic niches without having to buy the underlying assets. With ETPs, the pooling of different investment types enables both seasoned and novice investors to access a broad range of assets, from traditional stocks and bonds to more niche markets like commodities or specific industry sectors, all with the ease of buying and selling shares throughout the trading day. ETPs not only provide a platform for portfolio diversification but also enhance the financial ecosystem\u2019s adaptability, allowing investors to respond swiftly to market changes and opportunities. ETPs include other securities beyond ETFs, such as exchange-traded notes (ETNs) and exchange-traded commodities (ETCs). ETNs are debt instruments that track an index while carrying credit risk, while ETCs offer exposure to commodities and currencies, but can face unique risks discussed below. ETPs bundle securities into a portfolio to provide exposure to a wide array of assets, all while trading like stocks on major stock exchanges. These products are designed to offer diversified exposure, high liquidity, transparency, and cost efficiency. The first ETP is thought to be the Standard & Poor\u2019s Depositary Receipts (SPDRs), commonly known as \u201cSpiders.\u201d The first SPDR was introduced in 1993 and is now known by its ticker symbol, SPY. This product was designed to track the S&P 500 Index, allowing investors to buy shares in a portfolio that mirrors the performance of the S&P 500. The approval process for the first ETP was a significant milestone in financial markets, requiring collaboration among the American Stock Exchange, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and State Street Global Advisors, which developed and sponsored the ETP. Before SPY\u2019s debut, trading the S&P 500 Index was difficult, and investors had to dig into each component stock. SPY would be efficient for gaining exposure to the broad index through a single product. Given the novelty of this product, there were regulatory and logistical hurdles to overcome. Until then, stock exchanges focused on individual company stocks rather than pooled investment products. SPDRs adopted a unique share creation/redemption mechanism to assuage regulators to keep their prices closely aligned with the index it tracked. This mechanism allowed large broker-dealers to exchange underlying stocks for shares of the SPY ETP with the fund manager. SPDRs paved the way for the ETP industry by proving the appeal and feasibility of packaged financial products that supply diversified exposure to indexes through a publicly traded security. SPY remains the world\u2019s largest and most actively traded ETP, with an average of over 77.5 million shares exchanged daily and $490 billion in assets as of the first quarter (Q1) of 2024. ETPs have these main elements: Several advantages make ETPs an appealing investment vehicle: While they may be structured differently, all ETPs in the United States are regulated by the SEC for investor protection and transparency. The SEC reviews ETP prospectuses, requires regular disclosures, oversees market trading, and enforces rules around practices like manipulation and fraud. This oversight applies across the ETP spectrum, no matter its structure. However, the level of oversight depends on the type of ETP. For example, ETNs operate as unsecured debt securities issued by financial institutions. This differs from ETFs, which directly hold underlying assets. As a debt instrument, ETNs carry credit risk should the issuing institution default. As a result, the SEC monitors ETNs more closely than it does the diversification and tracking error risks of ETFs. While both are ETPs, the SEC tailors its approach based on each structure\u2019s characteristics to safeguard investors. ETFs are popular financial instruments designed to offer investors an easy and efficient way to gain diversified exposure to an entire index or market segment through a single trade. They are easily the most traded and best-known of the ETPs. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs trade on stock exchanges like equities. This gives ETFs the advantage of continuous pricing and trading throughout the day. ETFs hold a basket of assets that can include stocks across various sectors and industries, government and corporate bonds, commodities like natural gas or precious metals, and foreign currencies. The basket of assets held by an ETF is carefully selected and weighted to closely replicate the performance of a specific underlying index or benchmark. For example, a total stock market ETF would hold hundreds or even thousands of different stocks in proportion to their weight in a broad stock market index. By buying a share of the ETF, an investor instantly gains diversified exposure to the returns of the entire equity market rather than buying each stock separately. ETFs offer efficient, liquid, low-cost market access in a transparent, tax-efficient vehicle. Investors can also choose from various ETFs targeting more specialized market sectors based on their financial goals and risk tolerance. ETFs track many different market segments. Here are the most common: In addition to ETFs, other types of ETPs include ETNs and exchange-traded commodities (ETCs). ETNs combine bond investing with the tradability of stocks. Unlike ETFs, which hold underlying assets, ETNs are structured as unsecured debt securities issued by financial institutions. These notes promise to pay the holder a return based on the performance of a market index or other reference measure, minus applicable fees, at maturity. ETNs, however, have some unique risks and benefits: ETCs offer exposure to commodities, including metals, energy, and agricultural products, without directly investing in physical commodities or futures contracts. ETCs track the commodity\u2019s price or a basket of commodities, allowing investors to gain exposure to commodity markets through a security that trades on a stock exchange. There are differences between ETCs and ETFs that track commodities. Commodity ETFs are structured as funds and regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in the U.S. They hold either physical commodities (like gold or silver) or futures contracts on commodities. Commodity ETFs are considered equity products and are regulated like mutual funds and other ETFs. Exchange-traded commodities, like ETNs, are structured as debt securities, even though they track commodity prices. They are not considered funds in the traditional sense, but are debt instruments issued by a single entity. This means there are credit risks involving the issuer. ETCs can be broadly classified into two categories: As with ETNs, ETCs also present unique risks and benefits: When deciding whether an ETP or ETF makes the most sense for an investment strategy, investors should weigh several key factors: All ETPs have costs that affect the total return on investment. ETFs generally offer higher liquidity than other ETPs due to their broader market appeal and higher trading volumes. ETF liquidity also depends on a unique creation and redemption mechanism that allows for the adjustment of supply in the market, helping to maintain the ETF\u2019s price close to its net asset value (NAV). Depending on their specific type and market demand, other ETPs may not have this mechanism and can experience wider bid-ask spreads and lower trading volumes, potentially lowering liquidity. Both ETPs and ETFs in the U.S. are regulated by the SEC. However, the specific regulations depend on the type of ETP. Like mutual funds, ETFs are regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, with additional rules tailored explicitly to ETFs. Other ETPs, such as ETNs and ETCs, fall under different regulations based on their structure (e.g., debt securities). Despite these differences, all ETPs must follow SEC regulations to protect investors. As long as your broker approves you for short selling, ETPs and ETFs can be shorted like shares of stock. In fact, short selling may be easier with ETPs and ETFs than individual stocks because of the improved liquidity. There are also inverse ETFs that deliver inverse returns for short strategies without having to sell short any security. ETPs offer investors an efficient way to gain exposure to diverse assets pooled and traded on stock exchanges. ETPs have advantages like low costs, tax efficiency, liquidity, and transparency. ETFs are a subset of ETPs regulated by the SEC under the 1940 Investment Company Act, while ETPs can fall under further regulations depending on their assets. Investors should weigh factors like expenses, tracking ability, liquidity, diversification, and risks when choosing between ETPs and ETFs. Thorough research is vital to successfully incorporating these worthwhile investments in a portfolio. Both ETPs and ETFs can serve a valuable role in asset allocation when they match an investor\u2019s strategy, goals, and risk tolerance.

            "title": "U.K. Equity ETFs: What They Are and What You Need to Know",
            "content": "Investors interested in tapping into the United Kingdom\u2019s stock markets have choices. One is to open a brokerage account in the U.K. to buy U.K. stocks. Another is to invest in mutual funds focusing on U.K. equity securities. A third choice, easier and arguably more efficient for gaining exposure to U.K. equities, is through U.K. equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These funds are tied to a market where: U.K. equity ETFs are convenient, traded on stock exchanges like stocks, and are designed to mirror the performance of U.K. indexes like the FTSE 100 Index. These ETFs pool funds to buy a diversified portfolio of assets based on a chosen index\u2019s composition. Country-specific ETFs are an increasingly popular choice among investors seeking diversified exposure to specific geographic markets. U.K. equity ETFs offer specific benefits that some other regional ETFs cannot. These ETFs provide investors with an efficient way to gain exposure to the U.K. market, including various sectors and different levels of market capitalization. Investors interested in these equity ETFs should consider their investment goals, risk tolerance, and the specific characteristics of the ETFs available, including their underlying holdings, performance over time, the reputation of their managers, and fees. The United Kingdom, with a 2022 gross domestic product (GDP) of $3.09 trillion\u2014the sixth-largest in the world\u2014has in recent times faced a highly complex financial trajectory for an economy long considered among the world\u2019s most stable. The U.K. reached its peak GDP of $3.09 trillion in 2007 (all figures in early 2024 U.S. dollars) but has had extreme fluctuations since, falling and then returning to a GDP of $3.06 trillion in 2014 before falling again and then returning to $3.09 trillion in 2022, followed by flat or negative growth for the first three quarters of 2023. Among those peaks was the financial crisis of 2007\u201308, Brexit (which took effect in 2020), and the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, GDP per capita declined from $50,397 in 2007 to $46,125 in 2022. (For comparison, U.S. GDP per capita grew 59% to $76,329 in the same period.) The U.K.\u2019s economic outlook is mixed because of the lingering effects of Brexit, inflation, a tight labor market, and global economic pressures. In the near term, most analysts expect relatively weak economic growth, with S&P Global Ratings seeing \u201cmore stagflation ahead,\u201d PwC saying the U.K. is turning the page, Goldman Sachs calling the U.K. \u201csurprisingly resilient,\u201d and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) suggesting \u201cgrowth will remain stable but low\u201d representing the range of analyst forecasts. With inflation headed down and other major early 2020s economic headwinds for the U.K., there are investment prospects for those looking at U.K. equity ETFs. While U.K. indexes like the FTSE 100 have underperformed over the past decade vs. international peers like those in the European Union (EU), Japan, the U.S., and the MSCI World Index, its markets are famously attuned to fundamentals. For example, its higher weightings in energy and financials have meant it has weathered its storms relatively well and done comparatively better in years like 2022, when tech stocks were a drag elsewhere. Post-Brexit trade agreements and regulatory adjustments will likely reshape the investment landscape, potentially unlocking growth in green energy, local manufacturing, and fintech. Meanwhile, the U.K. economy is notably diverse, and its market is known for its stability, mature regulatory environment, and global connectivity, particularly in the financial services sector. Major exports include cars, gas turbines, gold, crude petroleum, and packaged medications. London remains a global center for finance and insurance. As a significant trading power, though, the U.K.\u2019s economy and financial markets are sensitive to changes in international trade. The strength or weakness of the British pound (GBP) relative to other currencies, especially the U.S. dollar, significantly affects the country\u2019s exports and imports. Investing in U.K. equity ETFs presents unique prospects despite the U.K.\u2019s recent economic challenges. Those considering U.K. equity ETFs should weigh the following factors to make more informed decisions: The U.K.\u2019s established financial markets and potential in emerging industries could make it a worthwhile option for a diversified portfolio of international investments. U.K. equity ETFs provide exposure to a basket of stocks representative of the U.K. market or specific parts of it. Most U.K. ETFs holding equities are designed to track the performance of a specific index, such as the FTSE 100 or FTSE 250. These ETFs aim to replicate the index\u2019s exposure and performance by holding the same stocks in similar proportions. In addition, like other types of ETFs, U.K. equity ETFs trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks. Thus, investors can buy and sell shares of a U.K. equity ETF throughout the trading day at market prices. As with other such funds, U.K. equity ETF shares are initially created in large blocks called creation units. These are typically bought and sold by institutional investors and are exchanged for a basket of underlying securities that mirror the ETF\u2019s portfolio. Market makers play a critical role in ensuring liquidity in the ETF. They assure trading by buying and selling ETF shares, working to keep the market price of the ETF close to its net asset value (NAV). To do that, market makers use arbitrage. If the ETF trades at a significant premium or discount to its NAV, then institutional investors, known as authorized participants, can profit from the price difference by creating or redeeming creation units, which helps realign the ETF\u2019s market price with its NAV. Compared with mutual funds, ETFs typically have lower fees called expense ratios. This is because most ETFs are passively managed, tracking an index rather than actively selecting stocks and other securities. Also, if U.K. equities, which are the ETF\u2019s underlying assets, pay dividends, then these are typically passed to ETF shareholders in cash or as additional shares in the ETF. Like other ETFs, U.K. equity ETFs are transparent about their holdings. Investors can easily access information about a fund\u2019s assets and contrast them against others. Lastly, ETFs can be more tax-efficient compared with mutual funds or with holding individual stocks. There are several main factors to assess when investing in U.K. equity ETFs: Doing thorough research and consulting with a financial advisor, especially one with experience with the U.K. market, is prudent to ensure that your chosen U.K. ETF aligns with your investment goals and risk profile. Keeping abreast of changes in market conditions and periodically reevaluating the investment are also critical for ensuring that the ETF continues to align with your needs. Diversification Exposure Income Market access Liquidity Lower costs Mature market Shared language Simplicity Tax efficiency Transparency Variety Market risk Foreign exchange risk Liquidity risk Concentration risk Interest rate risk Political and regulatory risk Geopolitical risk Taxation risk Tracking error risk U.K. equity ETFs offer several benefits in line with investing in ETFs. Here are some: While investing in U.K. equity ETFs has several advantages, like any investment, there are also disadvantages. Here are some key risks: The table below provides the largest U.K. equity ETFs. While most of these ETFs are listed on the London Stock Exchange and denominated in British pounds (GBP), there are also ETFs on U.S. exchanges, denominated in U.S. dollars. The iShares Core FTSE 100 UCITS ETF (ISF) is the largest measured by assets under management (AUM), at $13.97 billion. For expense ratios, the top U.K. equity ETFs have a range from as low as 0.07% to 0.50%, with an average expense ratio below at 0.22%. ISF offers the most competitive expense ratio within the selection, providing a 0.07% value. These ETFs vary widely in distribution yields, ranging from 0% to 5.48%, with the average distribution yield at 3.16%. The iShares UK Dividend UCITS ETF (IUKD) has the highest distribution yield at 5.48%, making it an attractive option for income-seeking investors. The best U.K. equity ETF depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. There is no one-size-fits-all ETF. Nevertheless, some general factors to review include historical performance, distribution yield, ETF volatility, expense ratios, tracking error, and liquidity. Changes in the pound\u2019s value can significantly impact U.K. equity ETFs in several ways: Many geographically based ETFs are available, covering a wide range of regions, countries, and specific areas within those countries. These ETFs allow exposure to different global markets, each with its own unique characteristics and investments. Some include global ETFs, regional ETFs, country-specific ETFs, emerging market ETFs, frontier market ETFs, and developed market ETFs. U.K. equity ETFs are investment vehicles that offer an efficient way to gain diversified exposure to the U.K. stock market. The funds, traded on stock exchanges, typically aim to track the performance of specific indexes like the FTSE 100 or FTSE 250 or focus on particular sectors within the U.K. economy. Like other ETFs, U.K. equity ETFs offer advantages such as diversification, liquidity, lower relative costs, transparency, and flexibility in investment strategies. However, investing in U.K. equity ETFs has certain risks, including market volatility, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and sector-specific risks. These risks should be weighed against your investment goals and risk tolerance.

BRICS exchange-traded funds (ETFs) invest in the emerging markets of Brazil, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). BRICS ETFs offer exposure to important emerging markets in a single fund, providing convenient access to stocks and bonds from these countries. As emerging markets, BRICS countries are expected to experience higher economic growth than developed markets\u2014as well as heightened volatility and uncertainty. This has led to increased interest in BRICS ETFs as an investment. The BRIC acronym was coined in 2001, after which the countries of Brazil, Russia, India, and China allied their fast-growing developing economies. In 2010, BRIC added South Africa, becoming BRICS. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, many BRICS indexes dropped Russia from their portfolios, and Russia-specific ETFs were delisted from American exchanges. In 2024, five more countries joined the alliance: Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. The expansion marks a push by some BRICS members to balance out a U.S.-dominated world economy. Higher potential returns Geographic diversification Emerging markets exposure Convenient Cost-effective Greater volatility and risk Political, regulatory, and economic uncertainty Currency exposure The higher projected gross domestic product (GDP) growth of BRICS economies compared with developed markets suggests a strong return potential for BRICS ETFs. As they expand, investing early in these emerging markets could supply higher long-term returns. BRICS growth projections are driven by increased industrialization, urbanization, and consumer demand within these economies. The 2024 additions to BRICS mean it covers not only about 3.5 billion people and many consumers, but also about 42% of global crude oil output. As these countries develop, companies within these markets could see significant gains in revenues and profits, translating into higher stock prices and greater returns for investors in BRICS ETFs. BRICS countries also tend to have younger populations and a growing middle class. These demographic shifts could lead to increased domestic consumption and a growing demand for various products and services from both domestic and foreign producers. BRICS ETFs offer diversification through exposure to different emerging markets in a single fund. This can help balance an investment portfolio heavily weighted in U.S. and European stocks and bonds. Indeed, most of the BRICS countries are significant actors on different continents, providing geographical diversification and broader emerging market exposure. They also have major oil reserves and other significant raw materials exports important for the world economy. While not directly contributing to higher returns, the diversification of BRICS ETFs can help achieve a more balanced portfolio. Diversification can enhance returns while mitigating risks compared with investing only in developed markets. For example, emerging economies may grow when developed markets like the United States or Western Europe stagnate. BRICS ETFs offer a straightforward way to invest in a diverse range of companies across its member countries. Investing in individual stocks in these countries would require a deep understanding of each market, including local economic conditions, regulations, and market dynamics. BRICS ETFs streamline this process by providing a single investment vehicle encompassing stocks across each country. By buying shares in a BRICS ETF, investors thus gain exposure to a basket of stocks spread across different sectors and regions in a single transaction. Direct investment in international markets (such as opening a foreign brokerage account) also often involves higher transaction costs and minimum investment thresholds, which can be prohibitive for individual investors. BRICS ETFs typically have lower transaction costs than direct international investments, allowing investors to gain exposure to these markets with relatively small investment amounts. Because they trade like shares, ETFs are liquid securities that can be bought and sold throughout the trading day, with many brokerages today offering commission-free trading in most ETFs. Emerging markets, including the BRICS countries, are often less efficient than developed markets. This means that information might not be reflected in stock prices as quickly or accurately as in more developed markets. Skilled investors and fund managers can exploit these inefficiencies to achieve higher returns. However, it\u2019s important to note that these inefficiencies can contribute to higher volatility and increased investment risk. Emerging markets tend to experience larger price swings. Therefore, a primary concern with BRICS ETFs is their potential for higher volatility than developed market investments. Stock markets in the BRICS countries can experience sudden fluctuations because of various factors, including economic uncertainty, political instability, trade disruptions, and global market dynamics. This could lead to significant short-term swings in the value of BRICS ETFs, which could be unsettling for risk-averse investors. For example, some BRICS economies, like Brazil, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, rely heavily on commodity prices. This means that the performance of ETFs invested in these countries can be disproportionately affected by global commodity market fluctuations and geopolitical events, adding other layers of risk. The political and economic environments in the BRICS countries can be less stable than in more developed economies. Changes in government policies, regulations, and political unrest can significantly impact these markets. For instance, armed conflict or sanctions have affected Russia, while regulatory changes can significantly impact China. Such instabilities can directly affect the performance of companies within BRICS ETFs. Regulatory environments in the BRICS countries can also be less robust than in developed markets, leading to concerns about corporate governance and transparency. This can make it more difficult for investors to accurately assess the risks and prospects of the companies within the ETF. When investing in BRICS ETFs, investors are also exposed to currency risk. Fluctuations in the value of these countries\u2019 individual currencies against the investor\u2019s home currency can affect returns from these ETFs. When those currencies weaken vs. the U.S. dollar, it negatively affects the relative performance of those holdings. The fact that the BRICS countries have experienced periods of high inflation in the past has also dampened currency values. Currency risk adds an extra layer of complexity and can either enhance or erode investment returns, depending on currency movements. When researching BRICS ETFs, review their holdings, expense ratios, liquidity, assets under management, and historical returns and compare them with each other and benchmarks. Higher expense ratios, for example, can erode net returns, all else being equal. Comparing several BRICs ETFs can help identify a suitable fund for your portfolio and risk tolerance. It\u2019s also important to diversify your exposure or pair BRICS ETFs with other emerging market ETFs rather than concentrate your exposure in the BRICS countries. Broader emerging market ETFs could provide more balanced exposure. In addition to ETFs that track stocks in the BRICS countries, there are other emerging markets funds to consider. The Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO), iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM), SPDR Portfolio Emerging Markets ETF (SPEM), and Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF (SCHE) all have broad-based emerging markets exposure, with BRICS among those from several other countries. Individual country ETFs, like those for Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, Thailand, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, among others, also have emerging market exposure. Note that two Russia-focused ETFs, RSX and ERUS, were delisted following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. China has the largest gross domestic product (GDP) of the BRICS countries, at just under $18 trillion in 2022, making it one of the largest economies in the world. Despite its significant economic growth and global influence, China\u2019s classification as an emerging market in the financial and investment world can seem counterintuitive. However, this designation is based on its low per-capita GDP, restrictive regulatory environment, capital controls, and limited market accessibility to foreign investors. The concept of BRICS was coined by Jim O\u2019Neill, a British economist, in 2001. At the time, O\u2019Neill was the chair of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. He introduced the term in \u201cBuilding Better Global Economic BRICs,\u201d published as part of the Global Economics Paper series by Goldman Sachs. Here are the estimated GDP growth rates for 2022: The Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) are among the most popular and widely traded emerging market ETFs. These ETFs are favored because of their broad exposure to a range of emerging market economies, large assets under management, and liquidity. BRICS ETFs provide exposure to the potentially high-growth emerging markets of the member countries in this alliance in a single fund. This offers convenience compared with picking individual stocks in each market. The key advantages of BRICS ETFs are diversification, access to fast-growing economies, and the possibility of generating higher long-term returns than developed markets. However, there are also greater risks involved. Volatility tends to be higher because of political instability, slower growth, and currency fluctuations. Also, the BRICS countries face challenges with corruption, infrastructure gaps, and economic reforms. For investors with high risk tolerance, a small allocation to BRICS ETFs can provide portfolio growth potential. But limit exposure to 5% to 10% of the total portfolio value. Emerging markets should be balanced with holdings in stable developed markets. Always conduct thorough research before selecting a specific BRICS ETF. Compare expenses, liquidity, holdings, and historical performance against other funds and benchmarks. Diversify across several emerging market ETFs rather than concentrating solely in the BRICS countries.

            "title": "Water ETFs: What They Are and How They Work",
            "content": "Water exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide exposure to groups of companies in the water industry, enabling investors to put money into firms preparing for future water scarcity while backing businesses committed to water sustainability. Water exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are professionally managed and allow investors to put money in the water industry without having to select and assess companies in the sector one by one. These ETFs hold stocks from water companies, including utilities, infrastructure, and treatment firms. The water sector is all-important for economic growth, environmental sustainability, and the fundamental needs of life. Around 2 billion people worldwide lack access to clean and safe water, highlighting this sector's critical need for development. Water infrastructure forms a cornerstone of sustainable development. Drinking water, agriculture, and food production all rely on this industry. Supplying drinking and other forms of water, wastewater treatment, and related services is also essential to modern life and the world's economy. In the U.S., firms in the industry and public water authorities grapple with public health hazards, water utilities face budget constraints, rising consumer costs, climate change, droughts, massive drainage in underground water supplies from years of misuse, and chronic underinvestment. By investing in these ETFs, investors can put money into firms responding to the rapidly rising global demand for water. Water ETFs offer the chance to invest in an essential resource while supporting businesses striving for sustainable water management. Investing in these funds is a strategic move for those who see water scarcity as a significant global issue, making them a crucial part of a diversified portfolio. Few industries can claim as much importance as this one. A significant problem among some parts of the water sector is that disclosure standards, especially for corporate water practices, can make it hard to assess the value of some companies in the industry. Water is a vital resource, and understanding the water industry, its potential risks, and opportunities is crucial for investors, communities, and nations facing water scarcity issues worldwide. The sector faces challenges such as contamination but also works to find solutions to solve one of the world's most significant problems. Like other ETFs, these funds are pools of capital that hold stocks or derivatives tracking companies in the water industry. The ETFs trade their shares on the major stock exchanges like individual stocks. Here are three significant parts of how ETFs work: The price of ETF shares is determined by the net asset value of the stocks and other holdings in the water sector and is divided by the number of shares outstanding. When reviewing these ETFs, you'll want to assess their expense ratios, assets under management, liquidity, and underlying holdings, among other matters. First entering the market in 2005, water ETFs have shown resilience given the constant need for water in life and almost all industrial sectors. In addition, specific trends in water ETFs usually mirror global water issues. An increase in investments may indicate a growing awareness of water scarcity and a commitment to sustainable water management. However, their returns, like all investments, are subject to market fluctuations. Investing in these types of ETFs has several advantages. Water ETFs typically hold shares in companies focused on water purification and efficient usage. For instance, the Global X Clean Water ETF (AQWA) puts money into companies producing more clean water through industrial water treatment, storage, and other methods. Investing in this area also allows you to support and benefit from organizations actively addressing water scarcity and quality issues. Water ETFs typically hold shares in companies like Danaher (DHR), Ecolab (ECL), and Pentair (PNR), which are involved in producing and putting in place water-related technologies and services that help mitigate the effects of the global water crisis. Here are some more potential benefits of investing in water ETFs: Despite these potential benefits, the suitability of water ETFs for your portfolio depends on your asset allocation, financial goals, and risk tolerance. The top three water ETFs regarding assets under management traded in the U.S. are PHO, FIW, and CGW. Invesco Water Resources ETF (PHO): With an expense ratio of 0.60%, this ETF tracks the investment results of the Nasdaq OMX U.S. Water Index. As of January 2024, it had assets under management (AUM) of about $1.89 billion. The PHO ETF primarily invests in securities of companies in the water industry, focusing on sustainability and resource management. First Trust Water ETF (FIW): This ETF targets companies engaged in the potable and wastewater industries. FIW ETF has an expense ratio of 0.53% and an AUM of about $1.48 billion. The ETF tracks the price and yield of the ISE Clean Edge Water Index. Invesco S&P Global Water Index ETF (CGW): This ETF tracks the S&P Global Water Index, offering exposure to 50 of the largest corporations globally involved in water-related businesses. Its expense ratio is 0.57%, with an AUM of about $933 million. The fund focuses on companies providing potable water, wastewater services, and other equipment and materials used for treating water. As always, before investing in these or any ETFs, do careful due diligence and double-check recently updated information about these funds. Diversified exposure to water industry stocks. Potential for long-term growth as companies and governments gear up to face global water crisis. Broad and possibly effective investment exposure to the potable and wastewater industry. Subject to sector-specific risks and uncertainties. Performance can be influenced by regulatory changes. Limited number of \"investable\" companies in the sector. Thematic focus might not align with all investors' strategies. Despite the potential for long-term growth because of the dangers to the global water supply, there are significant risks that investors need to consider. Let's go through some of them: Lastly, it's worth noting that these are thematic ETFs and, therefore, may not be suitable for all investors. Investing in water is driven by ensuring access to clean and safe water, which is a pressing ESG challenge. However, this thematic approach might not align with every investor's strategy or risk tolerance. Investing in water ETFs is relatively straightforward and can be done through your brokerage account. If you don't have one, you need to open an account, deposit funds, and buy shares of the desired water ETFs. Each ETF has a unique ticker symbol for trading on the stock exchange. To choose the right water ETF, review the fund's expense ratio, its investment strategy, and the specific segment of the water industry it targets. Keep an eye on your portfolio and seek advice from a financial advisor if needed to ensure it remains aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Aside from water ETFs, you could also invest in water by buying shares of companies (individual securities) that produce water-related equipment, such as pumps, meters, and filters, or companies that supply water. You can also research mutual funds that focus on water-related stocks. Water might be an excellent long-term investment because of increasing global demand and limited supply. Companies in the water industry are likely to benefit from these trends, potentially yielding attractive returns for investors. Some water ETFs can be green investments since they include companies involved in water conservation, purification, and infrastructure, which play a crucial role in sustainable water management. Yes, investing in water ETFs can be part of a socially responsible investing strategy as they often include companies focused on water conservation and sustainability. Water ETFs offer the opportunity to tap into the critical water sector, providing diversification and the potential for stable, long-term returns. However, these ETFs carry specific market risks, including the potential for costly regulatory changes and operational issues within water companies. Despite these risks, the long-term benefits of investing in water ETFs, especially for addressing ESG challenges, make them appealing to many investors.

            "content": "Michael Bromberg is a finance editor with a decade of experience. He is an expert at elucidating complex financial topics in clear, concise language. Michael received a Bachelor of Arts in literature from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a master's in linguistics from the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellin, Colombia. Investopedia / Mira Norian Precious metals exchange-traded funds (ETFs) invest in assets like gold, silver, and platinum, offering exposure to these markets without having to physically own and store them. Precious metals exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hold assets like gold, silver, and platinum and sell shares in their portfolios. Those who invest in a precious metals ETF are exposed to the price changes of these metals without having to own and physically hold them. Investors typically have several reasons for putting a part of their portfolio into precious metals ETFs. Gold and its counterparts can provide a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, and their low correlation with assets like stocks and bonds makes precious metals ETFs a means of further diversifying a portfolio. They are also relatively convenient and liquid, especially compared with transporting, securing, and holding the metals yourself. However, like other investments, precious metals ETFs have risks: They fluctuate with often-volatile metals prices, and the funds may not accurately track the performance of their assets. Let\u2019s review what\u2019s similar about all ETFs, including those involved in precious metals, before going into the specific differences encountered by precious metals ETF investors. Like other ETFs, these funds are pools of capital that hold assets and trade on the major stock exchanges. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the roles: While ETFs typically track the performance of an index of stocks or bonds, precious metals ETFs come in two broad categories: These follow the prices of precious metals like gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, either through direct holdings or through derivatives contracts. For ETFs that hold physical assets, authorized participants physically deliver bullion to the fund\u2019s vaults. Also, some precious metal commodity ETFs, instead of holding the metals, use futures contracts to track the price of the metal. In these cases, the creation and redemption process involves delivering or receiving the right number of futures contracts instead of the metals. Whether holding the precious metals in vaults, using derivatives contracts, or a combination of both, these funds look to mirror the performance of their underlying metal(s) in the market. Thus, for example, a silver ETF should gain 1% when there\u2019s a 1% increase in silver prices. These track the value of the companies in this sector that extract, refine, and trade these metals. The funds do this by holding a portfolio of publicly traded precious metal mining and related companies. The firms explore for these metals, mine them, process them, and then sell them on the world\u2019s markets. While the value of these businesses goes up and down with the metals they work with, owning shares in them through the ETF provides the benefit of this volatility not being tied one-to-one for every slight shift in these metals\u2019 prices. Nevertheless, precious metal mining ETFs face operational risks, labor shortages and strikes, and the explorational uncertainty involved in any mining operations. Many operations, like the metals themselves, are in areas affected by political struggles, climate-related disasters, and other contingent events that will influence the price of the metals and the companies that extract and refine them. Precious metals investments can add diversification and hedge against inflation or economic turmoil. Investing in an ETF can give you access to the precious metals markets without the cumbersome and expensive process of receiving and storing the physical metals. Since you can buy and sell precious metals ETFs as easily as any stock, you can trade them from your regular brokerage account or even a tax-advantaged individual retirement account (IRA). Thus, these ETFs are cost-effective for diversifying your portfolio with precious metals. If you buy gold or silver bullion, you might rack up significant fees and costs: storage, transportation, insurance, security, and so forth. However, trading precious metals ETFs is generally commission-free if you have an online brokerage account. Precious metals ETFs also offer the advantage of their liquidity. While selling a physical metal asset would involve lining up a buyer, transporting goods, and so on, investors can easily trade ETF shares at prevailing prices anytime the markets are open. Being able to issue different order types, like stop-losses and limits, produces more flexibility in managing precious metal assets. Like any other investment, precious metals ETFs have risks and challenges. First, the prices of precious metals and the funds that track them can be quite volatile, as they respond to economic and market conditions. The relative strength of the dollar, mining and production issues, industrial and central bank demand, and geopolitical events all affect the precious metals markets, so investors in these ETFs should be prepared for price fluctuations. Precious metals ETFs also involve counterparty risk. If the fund\u2019s management or the institutions backing the ETF face instability or financial issues, it could have an impact on your investment value and potential returns. This makes it particularly important to carry out due diligence before investing in any ETFs. There are over 20 U.S.-traded precious metals ETFs, including a pair of exchange-traded notes (ETNs). We can separate these ETFs based on the precious metals or sectors in which they invest. Gold has captivated human civilizations for thousands of years. The yellow metal retains its luster as a hedge against inflation and a store of value through volatile market periods. More ETFs invest in gold than any other precious metal, with some funds holding physical gold and others using derivatives to track gold prices. Gold mining ETFs invest in firms in the sector that explore, mine, refine, and trade this metal. Gold is mined in far more places than other precious metals, including Australia, Canada, China, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Russia, and the United States. Almost half of all gold is formed into jewelry, with another 20% ending up in central banks. Silver has its own storied history as a valued substance\u2014during various decades of economic history, it outpaced gold as an international store of value. Its highly conductive properties make the metal useful for an array of industrial applications. Silver, like gold ETFs, came onto the market in the early 2000s, seeking to replicate the returns of the silver market. These ETFs do so by holding physical silver bullion or using derivative instruments such as futures contracts linked to the silver price. The supply of silver comes mainly from Australia, Bolivia, Chile, China, Mexico, Peru, Poland, Russia, and the U.S. A plurality of the silver, about 34%, goes into physical investments (bars), with another 27% finding their way into electronics. Platinum is another precious metal with industrial uses, which is stronger and rarer than gold. There are two dedicated ETFs trading in the U.S. that provide exposure to platinum, both of which are backed by physical holdings. Each share represents a certain quantity of platinum stored in a secure vault, with the ETF trustee overseeing its management. Palladium is used in industrial, electronics, and manufacturing processes. There is one U.S.-traded ETF offering exposure to the metal. Like platinum, it is also physically backed by palladium holdings. Investing in these ETFs carries inherent risks, mainly market volatility. Platinum and palladium prices fluctuate significantly, often more than gold or silver, leading to potential losses and the stress that goes with it. Investors must consider supply-demand changes of these metals since they\u2019re quite sensitive to market changes. Platinum and palladium are platinum group metals, and the price of platinum is significantly influenced by its use in the automotive sector. When automobile sales are up, the value of platinum goes up. Essentially, when palladium prices increase, industrial manufacturers might switch to platinum, which, though usually more costly, is more efficient for specific uses. Platinum and palladium are extracted from ore deposits, often alongside nickel and copper ores. The main sources for both are in South Africa, followed by Zimbabwe and Russia. They mainly find their way into automotive catalytic converters to reduce dangerous emissions that cars otherwise put out. They can also be found in bulk chemical production as catalysts, dental and medical devices, and computer hard disks. Several ETFs offer exposure to several precious metals at once. These funds may physically hold various metals or depend on futures contracts to track their prices. If you are thinking about investing in precious metals ETFs, there are a few things to keep in mind. While you can trade precious metals ETFs with little or no commission, the funds have fees. You should compare the ETF\u2019s expense ratios, the amount charged to shareholders to cover the fund\u2019s operating costs, which is given as a percentage of assets under management (AUM). Precious metals ETFs can vary widely in this regard, from as low as 0.1% to 0.9%. The expense ratio highly influences your net returns over time. You\u2019ll also want to review the liquidity of the precious metals ETFs you\u2019re considering. Average daily trading volume can indicate how easy it is to enter and exit your positions. This is particularly crucial in this space since trading volumes can, for some ETFs, go down to a trickle. In addition to their performance over time, you\u2019ll want to compare precious metals ETFs for their tracking error, which occurs when the fund\u2019s performance does not entirely match the changes in price for the underlying assets. It\u2019s important to know a fund\u2019s aims, including whether it\u2019s backed by physical assets or derivatives, and the investment strategy it follows to track the performance of the underlying assets. The roster of U.S.-traded precious metals ETFs includes single-metal funds devoted to silver or gold, a few targeting platinum or palladium, and several ETFs that offer multimetal exposure. Here are some of the top precious metals ETFs available in the U.S.: While trading precious metals ETFs is the same as any other stock or ETF, there are a few tax implications specific to this space. Like other investments, your tax liability will depend on how long you hold the investment. If you own shares in a precious metals ETF for less than a year, you\u2019ll trigger a short-term capital gains tax, which is levied at your regular income tax rate. If you hold the asset for longer than a year, you will owe taxes based on the long-term capital gains rate. Precious metals are considered collectibles for tax purposes, and accountants typically agree that metals-backed ETFs fall into the same category. This means that precious metals ETFs are subject to a maximum federal long-term capital gains tax rate of 28%, higher than the 20% cap for stocks, bonds, and other investments. This higher tax rate can have an impact on your investment returns, so it should be a part of your calculation as you consider these investment funds. ETFs are a cost-effective way to gain access to the precious metals markets, helping you avoid costs like storage and delivery fees that you would face if you bought the physical metals. Besides ETFs, mutual funds focused on the sector can provide exposure to gold, silver, and other precious metals. Precious metals ETFs stand out from their mutual fund counterparts because investors can buy and sell ETFs throughout the trading day, while mutual funds are priced and tradable after the market closes for the day. This allows traders to use ETFs to benefit from short-term, intraday fluctuations in precious metals prices. In addition, ETFs often have lower expenses and lower minimum investments than mutual funds. Another way to invest in precious metals is to buy shares of mining companies\u2014whether you load up on individual stocks or buy shares in a fund that invests in a basket of mining companies. Investing in mining stocks means taking an equity stake in the industry rather than gaining exposure to the metals\u2019 price. Compared with precious metals ETFs, investing in mining companies involves other risks, including operational, labor, and geological concerns. Buying and selling precious metals ETFs is a relatively straightforward process. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown that will have you investing in these markets: Precious metals typically include eight elements: gold, silver, platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium. Everything after silver in this list are platinum group metals. Gold and silver are more commonly traded, with many ETFs providing investment exposure, followed by platinum and palladium. Based on prices of around $4,500 per ounce, more than twice the price of gold, iridium is the most precious of the precious metals. One of the platinum metals, iridium is one of the rarest elements and has a variety of specialized industrial uses. Like any financial decision, settling on the best precious metal investment depends on your risk tolerance and goals. Gold remains the traditional choice as a store of value, while silver is more tied to industrial applications. Platinum and palladium may offer higher potential returns, but they come with increased volatility and are available through a more limited set of investment vehicles. Rare earth metals have unique qualities and specific industrial uses in magnets and batteries. Several ETFs provide exposure to these materials. For example, the VanEck Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF (REMX) invests in a basket of equities related to rare earth mining and production. Investors who want access to the precious metals markets without the arduous process of owning, transporting, and securing them in physical form often turn to ETFs. These funds can add diversification to an investment portfolio. Since they trade shares on the stock market, they offer liquidity and flexibility not available with other types of precious metals investments. As with any investment, it\u2019s important to understand how precious metals ETFs work, including their expenses and investment strategy. It may be worth talking with a financial advisor to help determine how these assets would support your overall investment strategy.

            "title": "Treasury ETFs: What They Are and How They Work",
            "content": "Investopedia / Tara Anand Treasury ETFs offer a convenient way to gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of Treasurys without the need to manage individual securities. Treasury exchange-traded funds (ETFs) trade like stocks on the major exchanges. They hold a portfolio of U.S. Treasury securities, with each ETF differing in time to maturity from less than a year up to 30 years. First introduced in the early 2000s, they have grown in popularity, and there are now more than 50 of them to choose from. Typically not as exciting as other securities, Treasury securities\u2019 swings have meant that those seeking to lower the overall risk of their portfolio might want this part of their holdings managed professionally. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, substantial changes in interest rates have happened worldwide, with the United States being a prime example. The overall shift can be seen in the moves of the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, which hit a record low of 0.33% in March 2020, then surged to a high of 5.02% in October 2023, before settling to around 4.5% in early 2024. These dramatic changes came from disruptions in the supply chain, persistently high post-pandemic inflation, and most significantly, the ratcheting-up of interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Treasury ETFs stand out for their lower costs than other ETFs, tax efficiency, and exposure to varying lengths of maturity and bond coupons. Treasury ETFs present minimal risk, making them an attractive choice for those navigating the evolving interest rate landscape. Treasury ETFs are designed to track the performance of Treasurys, including short-, intermediate-, and long-term maturities of Treasury bills (maturity of a year or less), notes (one to 10 years), and bonds (20 or 30 years). They provide investors with an efficient and convenient way to gain exposure to U.S. government debt with the convenience of doing so from a brokerage account. Investors typically use Treasury ETFs for income generation, capital preservation, and portfolio diversification. They are particularly popular among conservative investors and those seeking a stable, government-backed income stream. More aggressive investors tend to use Treasury ETFs to speculate on changes in interest rates. Like all investments, they are not without risks, particularly interest rate and inflation risks. U.S. Treasurys are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, making them just about the safest investment option available. Low-risk and traded like stocks, Treasury ETFs are also highly liquid. This means you can buy and sell shares of the ETF throughout the trading day at market prices, providing the flexibility you wouldn\u2019t have if you bought the Treasurys yourself. It\u2019s important to understand how U.S. Treasurys are priced, since their value depends heavily on changes in interest rates. In general, as interest rates rise, existing bonds tend to decrease in value, and conversely, as rates fall, bond values increase. This affects Treasury ETFs and the aggregate value of the U.S. Treasury they hold, so understanding how interest rates influence them is important to know. Treasury ETFs are also valued for how they diversify investment portfolios. Given their historically low correlation with stocks and other asset classes, they can serve as a hedge against market volatility or economic downturns. This makes them attractive for lowering the overall risk of a portfolio. It\u2019s important to note that Treasury ETFs are fixed-income instruments. They come with differing yields and durations, depending on the maturities of the bonds they hold. Short-term Treasury ETFs are typically less sensitive to changes in interest rates and offer lower yields, while long-term Treasury ETFs are more sensitive to interest rate fluctuations but usually have higher yields. This means you can choose the ETF containing the Treasurys that best match your investment horizon, financial goals, and risk tolerance. ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, like individual stocks. They combine the diversification offered by mutual funds with the liquidity and ease of trading of a stock. The key, of course, is that these ETFs hold U.S. Treasurys, which are debt instruments issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. These include Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. Most Treasury ETFs are passively managed and are designed to track the performance of a particular Treasury bond index. Each index has its criteria, such as the maturities and the type of Treasurys included. Treasury ETFs have large institutional investors, known as authorized participants, that can create new shares of an ETF or redeem them. This is done by delivering the underlying securities to the fund in exchange for ETF shares (creation) or vice versa (redemption). This helps to keep the ETF\u2019s market price close to its net asset value. Though traded on exchanges like stocks, Treasury ETFs do not pay dividends. Instead, they pay interest income, called distributions, from the underlying Treasury securities. Distributions are usually done monthly and can vary depending on interest payments received from the Treasurys in the ETF\u2019s portfolio. Like other ETFs, Treasury ETFs charge a fee for managing the fund. This is called the expense ratio and is typically lower than that of actively managed funds. In the United Kingdom, India, and other commonwealths, the equivalent of a U.S. Treasury security is a gilt security. These trade through gilt ETFs and mutual funds. Treasury ETFs can cater to different investment strategies and risk profiles. Some short-term Treasury ETFs put money into Treasury securities with less time to maturity\u2014generally, less than three years. There are intermediate-term Treasury ETFs, which invest in Treasurys with maturities from three to 10 years. Long-term Treasury ETFs hold securities with maturities greater than 10 years. Another category of Treasury ETFs is for those that hold Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS). The principal value of TIPS adjusts with inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. There are also floating-rate Treasury ETFs. These ETFs put money into Treasury floating rate notes (FRNs), whose interest adjusts according to short-term interest rates. These offer protection when interest rates rise (and existing bond values decline). The last funds we review are zero-coupon Treasury ETFs, which invest in Treasury STRIPS (an acronym for separate trading of registered interest and principal of securities). These are zero-coupon bonds created by separating the interest and principal of Treasury notes and bonds. They are bought at a discount and mature at face value, with the difference representing the interest earned. As with any other investment, you\u2019ll want to review how a Treasury ETF fits with your goals and risk tolerance. Initially, you\u2019ll need to assess the broader economic environment and monetary policy of the U.S. This can significantly influence Treasury securities. Another factor to consider for Treasury ETFs and fixed-income investments in general is interest rates. When rates rise, the value of existing bonds tends to fall, and vice versa. Treasury ETFs hold a portfolio of U.S. Treasurys, and thus the value of these ETFs comes from the aggregate of all the Treasurys in their portfolios. Also, longer-duration ETFs are generally more sensitive to interest rate changes than shorter-duration ETFs. The duration and maturity of the Treasury securities in the ETF should also be considered. Short-term Treasury ETFs are less sensitive to interest rate changes but typically offer lower yields, while long-term Treasury ETFs are more sensitive but often have higher yields. Investors should also assess the yield of the Treasury ETF, which depends on the underlying securities\u2019 maturities and current interest rates. Higher yields often come with more risk. You should check the trading volume and liquidity of any Treasury ETFs you consider. This means that an ETF\u2019s shares are easier to buy and sell without affecting the price. You should also review each ETF\u2019s expense ratio. A lower expense ratio can be more cost-effective, especially for long-term investments, though a badly managed ETF will likely cost you more in the long run, no matter the fees. Treasury ETFs carry specific implications for your taxes, including interest income and potential capital gains. We discuss this further below. Accessibility Cost-effectiveness Credit quality Hedge against inflation Income Liquidity Tax efficiency Transparency Variety Interest rate risk Expense ratio Fiscal and monetary policy changes Market risks Opportunity costs Relatively low yield Tax considerations Tracking error There are several reasons why Treasury ETFs have grown in popularity: Treasury ETFs also have risks, so it\u2019s important to review how Treasury ETFs fit into your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. Here are some of their drawbacks: While Treasury ETFs offer safety and diversification, they should be part of a well-executed portfolio strategy rather than stand-alone investments. Buying shares of Treasury ETFs involves several simple steps. If you already invest in the stock market, you\u2019re halfway there. First, before placing an order, evaluate your financial goals, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. How does a Treasury ETF fit into your overall portfolio strategy? Next, research Treasury ETFs and review their maturity profile, yield, expense ratio, and performance history. If you\u2019re a first-time investor, you\u2019ll open a brokerage account next. Choose a reputable broker that aligns with your needs, considering trading fees, platform usability, and available research tools. Once you\u2019ve selected a brokerage and opened an account, you\u2019ll need to put funds into it. Following this, based on your research and investment goals, choose a Treasury ETF that meets your criteria. Here are some questions to ask: Once you\u2019ve chosen one, you\u2019ll buy shares in the ETF. But this doesn\u2019t end the investing process\u2014in a sense, it\u2019s just starting. You\u2019ll have to check the performance of the securities as part of your overall portfolio. You\u2019ll look for changes in economic conditions, interest rates, and other factors affecting the ETF\u2019s performance. You should also review your entire portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Shift your investments when needed. Investing in Treasury ETFs can be worthwhile for diversifying most portfolios, offering safety, income, and liquidity. However, like all investments, it\u2019s essential to do your research or seek advice from a financial advisor to ensure any investment is right for you. The table below provides data on the top and largest Treasury ETFs by assets under management (AUM). The combined AUM of the top 10 Treasury ETFs is about $257 billion, with an average AUM of about $25.66 billion. This is a strong presence in the market, highlighting investor interest in these ETFs. The largest is the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), which has $48.48 billion in AUM. These ETFs are notably consistent in their fees. The average expense ratio is 0.11%, with the lowest\u2014the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF (VGSH)\u2014at 0.04%, and the highest\u2014the iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP)\u2014at 0.19%. The distribution yield varies from 2.69% for the iShares US Treasury Bond ETF (GOVT) to 4.91% for the SPDR Bloomberg 1\u20133 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL). The average distribution yield is 3.48%. The average yield to maturity (YTM) for these 10 Treasury ETFs spans from 3.90% to 5.36%, with the average at 4.54%. The lowest average YTM is for the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF (VGIT), while the highest is the iShares 0\u20133 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV). The maturity of the ETFs\u2019 basket of Treasurys can differ across these ETFs. The fund with the shortest weighted-average maturity, SGOV, is just 0.09 years. The longest, TLT, is 25.62 years. The average maturity for the list below is 5.86 years. Some Treasury ETFs focus on short-term U.S. Treasurys, including those with maturities of about one year. However, no ETF invests only in one-year Treasury securities. Instead, these ETFs typically include a range of Treasurys with maturities from a few months to a few years. Technically, Treasury ETFs do not pay dividends, since those are a share of company profits. Instead, Treasury ETFs pay interest income and, at times, capital gains on the underlying U.S. Treasurys through distributions. These are generally paid monthly. While Treasury ETFs are considered safe as a credit risk, they are not immune to market and interest rate risks. Investors should consider these in the context of their overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. An inverse Treasury ETF is designed to perform in the opposite direction of the moves of Treasury securities. Thus, these ETFs increase in value when Treasury bond prices fall and decrease in value when Treasury bond prices rise. Investors tend to use this ETF when expecting a decline in Treasury bond prices, often because interest rates are predicted to rise. Treasury ETFs offer investors exposure to U.S. Treasury securities, ranging from short-term bills to long-term bonds. There are also inflation-protected and floating-rate Treasury ETFs. These ETFs pool investors\u2019 money to purchase a portfolio of Treasurys, aiming to replicate the performance of specific bond indexes. Like stocks, they are traded on exchanges, combining the liquidity and ease of stock trading with the creditworthiness of the U.S. government. With their large variety of maturity profiles, yield potential, and sensitivity to interest rates, Treasury ETFs are a flexible and cost-effective tool for investors to manage risk, generate income, and diversify their portfolios.

An agricultural exchange-traded fund (ETF) invests predominantly in commodities or the stocks of companies involved in the agriculture sector. These ETFs provide exposure to crops, livestock, and equipment or services for farming and food production. Agricultural exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a convenient way to gain exposure to the agricultural sector. These funds track the performance of agricultural commodities, companies, and indexes. Unlike buying individual commodities or stocks, investing in an agricultural ETF gives you a diversified portfolio in this sector with shares that trade like stocks. These ETFs can provide a basket of different agricultural assets, from corn and wheat to companies specializing in farm equipment. Agricultural ETFs work by pooling investor capital to buy a range of assets related to farming and agriculture. These ETFs then track the price movements of those assets. When you invest in an agricultural ETF, you\u2019re essentially buying shares in this portfolio. The value of your shares goes up or down with the fund\u2019s performance. The fund is managed by authorized participants, who are there to ensure the ETF\u2019s price reflects the value of its underlying assets. There are two main types of agricultural ETFs: The first type of agricultural ETF focuses on investing in the stocks of agribusiness companies. These companies are involved in all or part of the agriculture supply chain, including production, processing, distribution, and retail. Investing in these ETFs exposes investors to seed and fertilizer manufacturers, farm machinery producers, food-processing companies, and large-scale farming operations. Agribusiness ETFs offer a way to invest in the business side of agriculture, leveraging the potential growth of these companies. These ETFs typically track an index comprising agribusiness stocks. Investors benefit from the diversification that these ETFs offer since they are not tied to the performance of a single company but the collective performance of several. However, it\u2019s important to note that investing in agribusiness stock ETFs also means exposure to risks typical in the stock market, including market volatility and company-specific risks. These ETFs generally suit investors who are interested in the agricultural sector\u2019s growth potential but prefer publicly traded companies\u2019 stability and established nature. The primary advantage of these ETFs lies in their diversification within the stock market, tapping into the growth potential of agribusiness companies driven by global food demand and technological advances. Investors can expect more stability than direct commodity investments, as these ETFs are tied to the performance of established companies. However, they are not without risks, including market volatility and sector- and company-specific issues. These ETFs are best suited for investors seeking exposure to the agricultural sector through a traditional stock market approach, combining the potential for growth with the stability of established companies. Allow profiting from production, distribution, and processing Diversification within the sector Professionally managed portfolios Limited direct commodity exposure Exposed to input cost inflation, food safety issues, and changing consumer preferences The second type of agricultural ETF invests in agricultural commodities. These ETFs offer exposure to physical commodities like corn, soybeans, wheat, and cattle. Some invest directly in these commodities, but most use derivatives contracts such as futures and options to gain exposure. This approach allows investors to invest in the price moves of these commodities without the need to hold the physical goods. Commodity-based agricultural ETFs are an excellent tool for investors looking to hedge against inflation or diversify their portfolios beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Since the performance of commodities is often not correlated to stock markets, they can provide a cushion during market downturns. However, these ETFs also come with their own risks. Commodity prices can be extremely volatile, influenced by weather conditions, geopolitical tensions, and changes in supply and demand. Additionally, investors need to be aware of the complexities of derivatives trading, such as the potential for contango and backwardation in the fund\u2019s performance. Agricultural commodity ETFs offer more direct exposure to the commodities markets, specifically targeting agricultural products like grains, livestock, and related products. Their main benefit is providing a hedge against inflation and a diversification option that\u2019s not typically correlated with the performance of the stock market. These ETFs can be attractive for their potential for high returns, especially during times of commodity scarcity or increased demand. However, they come with inherent risks, such as high volatility because of weather conditions and geopolitical events. Additionally, the use of derivatives in these ETFs adds a layer of complexity and risk, including the effects of contango and backwardation. Agricultural commodity ETFs are suitable for investors looking for direct exposure to the commodities market and willing to navigate the higher volatility for potentially greater returns. More direct tracking of specific commodity prices Easier than trading directly in the commodities or derivatives markets directly Could be a more effective inflation hedge Use derivatives, which can be complex and carry additional risks like contango and backwardation Face more direct risks from bad weather, natural disasters, and sudden shifts in the supply and demand balance for the specific commodity Here are some key factors to consider when evaluating agricultural ETFs: Incorporating these factors into due diligence will help identify well-structured agricultural ETFs suited to an investor\u2019s specific objectives and risk tolerance. Periodic rebalancing is also recommended to maintain target allocations over time. Some commodity exchange-traded products are structured as limited partnerships (LPs). Investors in these ETFs might receive a Schedule K-1 for tax purposes, which can complicate tax filings as LPs pass through their income, gains, losses, and deductions to their investors. Investments in certain types of commodity ETFs could also generate \u201cunrelated business taxable income,\u201d which can be an issue for tax-exempt investors like individual retirement account (IRA) holders. Commodity ETFs that hold futures may generate income subject to the blended 60/40 tax rates applied to Section 1256 contracts. This blend aims to balance short- and long-term rates. Investing in commodities is complicated, and tax rules and laws are constantly changing. Always consult with your tax professional for any questions about the taxation of ETFs. This table offers a snapshot comparison of investing in individual agricultural stocks compared with agriculture commodity ETFs and agribusiness ETFs. When considering such an investment, it\u2019s important to review each option in terms of your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions. While there\u2019s no specific ETF for investing exclusively in farmland,\u00a0the First Trust Indxx Global Agriculture ETF (FTAG) comprises farmland companies and firms involved in chemicals and fertilizers, seeds, irrigation equipment, and farm machinery. Other agribusiness or agricultural commodity ETFs like MOO or DBA can give indirect exposure to farmland through the crops they produce or the equipment that farms them. This is mainly because ETFs are structured to hold securities like stocks and bonds rather than direct land holdings. That said, at least two real estate investment trusts (REITs) hold primarily farmland. Like ETFs, REITs trade like shares on stock exchanges but own and manage real property on behalf of shareholders: Whether agriculture ETFs have been a good investment in the past often depends on the specific time frame and the type of ETF.\u00a0Historically, agriculture as a sector has shown mixed results. Their performance is closely tied to the agricultural commodities market, which can be highly volatile. Weather patterns, geopolitical events, global supply-demand dynamics, and economic trends significantly influence this sector. For instance, periods of commodity scarcity or booming global demand can lead to impressive returns, while oversupply or reduced demand can lead to underperformance. Still, as the world population increases, so does the demand for food and related businesses. This fundamental need can drive long-term growth in the agriculture sector. Innovation in agricultural practices and sustainability measures can also boost productivity and efficiency in the industry, potentially benefiting agribusiness companies\u2019 profitability. Agriculture is often considered a good hedge against inflation, primarily because it involves tangible assets whose value can rise with increasing prices. The essential nature of agricultural products further ensures steady demand, which tends to remain resilient or even grow during inflationary periods, potentially leading to higher commodity prices. Additionally, supply constraints in agriculture, such as limited land and water resources, can further elevate prices when demand outstrips supply, especially during inflation. Research shows that agricultural products historically have had the highest correlation with inflation compared with energy and industrial commodities, with grain commodities like barley, oats, and wheat exhibiting especially high inflation hedging capacity over the centuries. However, since the second half of the 20th century, the correlation between agricultural commodities and inflation fell from the 0.6 range to just around 0.2, while energy commodities became a more effective hedge. The declining hedging capacity of agricultural commodities over time was attributed to the rising importance of industrial and energy commodities and greater diversity in consumption baskets determining inflation. Investing in agricultural ETFs offers a balanced mix of risk and potential reward. It allows investors to tap into the vital agricultural sector\u2019s growth while providing diversification to stabilize their portfolio. Agribusiness ETFs invest in diversified portfolios of stocks related to the agriculture and farming industries, while commodities ETFs invest in one or more agricultural products like corn or wheat using derivatives contracts.

            "title": "Hong Kong ETFs: What They Are and How They Work",
            "content": "Hong Kong exchange-traded funds (ETFs) track the performance of Hong Kong equities and other assets, usually through indexes tied to the market. These indexes can range from the broader market to specific sectors within the Hong Kong economy. Like other ETFs, Hong Kong ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, offering exposure to the Hong Kong market without the need to buy individual securities. Hong Kong ETFs work by tracking a particular index representing a segment of the Hong Kong stock market. This is done by buying all or a representative group of the securities in the underlying index. The ETF\u2019s price fluctuates throughout the trading day, like individual stocks, and most ETFs are highly liquid. Key characteristics of Hong Kong ETFs include their performance, which reflects the underlying index\u2019s return, and their expense ratio, which is the annual fee charged to investors. In addition, each ETF has specific holdings (the individual securities it owns) and sector allocations (how its assets are distributed across different sectors). Other important factors include trading volume (how frequently shares are bought and sold) and tracking errors (how closely the ETF follows its index). These collectively determine the suitability of a particular Hong Kong ETF for you. Investing in Hong Kong ETFs offers several benefits. A primary advantage is diversification. By investing in a Hong Kong ETF, you get direct exposure to a broad range of companies within the Hong Kong market, spreading your risk across many stocks rather than relying on the performance of a single company or a smaller number of shares. This can be worthwhile for those seeking broad international diversification in their portfolios. It\u2019s also a chance to benefit from the attractive potential of the Hong Kong market. Hong Kong is a leading financial center with a dynamic and robust economy. Investing in a Hong Kong ETF allows investors to participate in this growth. In addition, ETFs offer advantages such as liquidity (generally, easy trading throughout the trading day), transparency (holdings are disclosed daily), and lower costs than mutual funds. The two top Hong Kong ETFs available in U.S. markets are the iShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF (EWH) and the Franklin FTSE Hong Kong ETF (FLHK). EWH has about $600 million in net assets as of late January 2024 and is the oldest and largest Hong Kong ETF. It aims to replicate the performance of the MSCI Hong Kong Index, providing exposure to large and midsized Hong Kong companies. EWH comes with an expense ratio of 0.50%. FLHK tracks the FTSE Hong Kong Capped Index, and its inception was in 2017. Its assets under management are significantly smaller than EWH: about $10.86 million as of late January 2024. When choosing a Hong Kong ETF, several factors should be considered. First, the fund\u2019s objective is crucial since it should align with your investment goals. Holdings are another critical aspect, as they represent the ETF\u2019s assets. Liquidity is also essential, as it determines how easily an investor can trade shares of the ETF. The provider\u2019s size, scale, expertise, and commitment can also impact your investment, so these should also be considered. Evaluating an ETF\u2019s performance and track record is an essential step. This includes understanding the performance of the ETF, the underlying index it tracks, and how it does so. Also, review the ETF\u2019s costs. Remember that past performance is not a guarantee of future results, and your choice should fit your risk tolerance and investment goals. Investing in Hong Kong ETFs can be done simply through a brokerage account. You need to open an account with a broker that provides access to international markets, including Hong Kong. Ensure that the broker you choose is regulated and has a good reputation. Research the available Hong Kong ETFs, assessing fund objectives, holdings, liquidity,\u00a0performance track record, and fees. To buy shares in a Hong Kong ETF, follow these steps: Log into your brokerage account, search for the ticker symbol of the ETF you\u2019re interested in, specify the number of ETF units you want to buy, and submit your order. Remember to conduct due diligence beforehand, review your transactions, and check your investments regularly. Investing in Hong Kong ETFs offers the chance to tap into a dynamic financial market. Before doing so, however, understanding the specific risks and market dynamics of Hong Kong is essential. Hong Kong is a global financial powerhouse, renowned for its high degree of internationalization and its role as a critical gateway for investments in and out of China. Its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2002, according to The World Bank, was $166.35 billion, climbing to $359.84 billion by 2022, in 2022 U.S. dollars. Hong Kong operates under a distinct system from mainland China, yet Chinese economic policies and developments profoundly impact its economy. This complex interdependence underscores the importance for investors to watch political and economic changes in China, given their significant influence on Hong Kong\u2019s market. Additionally, Hong Kong\u2019s role as a critical gateway to Chinese and other Asian markets extends its economic influence far beyond what is reflected in its GDP alone. The real estate sector, a significant part of Hong Kong\u2019s economy, is characterized by high property prices and a market that can significantly drive economic growth, offering attractive prospects in related ETFs. As a pivotal trading hub, Hong Kong\u2019s reliance on trade, especially with mainland China and other Asian countries, underscores the importance of global trade for its market performance. Investors must also navigate currency risks with the Hong Kong dollar\u2019s peg to the U.S. dollar. This peg affects monetary policy and can influence inflation and interest rates, impacting investment returns. Hong Kong\u2019s traditional appeal has been its free-market policies, low taxation, and minimal government intervention. However, the evolving political landscape and recent changes in security laws pose potential risks that could alter this environment. The focus on technology in Hong Kong, fueled by government initiatives aimed at economic diversification, presents new avenues for ETF investment. This shift toward a more innovation-driven economy could redefine traditional investment strategies. Fueled by local and global events, market volatility remains a crucial consideration. Political shifts, policy changes, and global economic trends can all significantly influence the value of Hong Kong ETFs. China\u2019s global financial influence, particularly the role of Hong Kong as an international financial center, is crucial. The dynamics of the yuan exchange rate and China\u2019s economic growth rate are also important to assess. In light of these risks and prospects, a well-diversified portfolio is key. Regular monitoring, staying informed about global and local developments, and strategic use of stop-loss orders can help mitigate potential losses. Generally, transparency in ETF holdings and performance Offers broad diversification of different stocks Convenient trading during market hours Political risks because of changes in government policies may increase the volatility and potential loss of the ETF value Potential liquidity risk affecting buy/sell prices Currency risk because of different currency denomination As of the beginning of 2023, the asset size of Hong Kong\u2019s ETF market was about $48.9 billion in U.S. dollars, making it the fourth largest in Asia ex-Japan. Yes, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is part of China, but it operates under a separate regulatory regime because of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle. Apart from ETFs, investors can also directly buy individual securities of enterprises listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange or mutual funds focused on Hong Kong exposure. The insurance sector is the largest sector represented in the EWH fund, followed by real estate management and development, financial services, and capital goods. Hong Kong ETFs offer advantages like diversification, transparency, and the opportunity for international market exposure. They provide investors access to Hong Kong\u2019s economy and can be traded on stock exchanges. Before investing, interested investors should conduct due diligence and consider expense ratio, performance, size, liquidity, and Hong Kong-specific risks. iShares by BlackRock. \u201cEWH: iShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF.\u201d etf.com. \u201cHong Kong ETFs.\u201d Franklin Templeton. \u201cFLHK: Franklin FTSE Hong Kong ETF.\u201d The World Bank, World Bank Open Data. \u201cGDP (Current U.S.$)\u2014Hong Kong SAR, China.\u201d Financial Times. \u201cLarge Hong Kong-listed ETFs Show Resilience in 2022.\u201d"

            "title": "How to Invest Globally Through ETFs",
            "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a straightforward way to diversify portfolios. Investing in a single fund exposes you to many different securities. Investing in ETFs with holdings across a range of global markets is one way to add further diversification. Global investing can give you a stake in markets poised for significant growth, though it\u2019s important to consider the risks involved. No matter where you live, odds are good that you\u2019re most familiar with your country\u2019s businesses and stock market. An American, for example, likely knows about major stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and primarily invests in American companies. However, there are dozens of global markets, and some investors want exposure to foreign companies and other assets in their investment portfolios. This can be difficult, complicated, and expensive. Investing globally through ETFs makes the process easier. These funds trade on American stock exchanges but hold shares in foreign companies. That means you can buy shares easily in these ETFs to speculate in foreign markets, including emerging markets with the potential for future growth. When investing globally, you need to consider the same risks as investing domestically. It\u2019s important to research the funds you want to invest in to ensure you understand their goals, the fees they charge, and their potential for risk and reward. However, global investing also brings many other risks that you need to consider. For example, currency fluctuations can significantly affect your investment\u2019s performance. When Americans want to invest in the Japanese stock market, they use dollars to buy shares, but if the yen weakens, their investments lose value in dollar terms. For example, from January 2023 to January 2024, the value of the yen fell by 13% compared with the dollar. If you invested in 2023 and sold in 2024, the shares held by the ETF would have needed to appreciate by 13% in yen just to break even. Meanwhile, if the currency you\u2019re investing in goes up, that would increase the value of your investment. Geopolitics also comes into play. While all markets worldwide are interconnected directly or indirectly, you\u2019ll likely face increased risk when investing in foreign markets. For example, investors with stakes in ETFs focused on the Russian market in 2021 would likely have had the value of their investment fall significantly after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In late February 2022, trading of Russian companies was halted by the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, making it difficult to regain your stake. One ETF focused on the Russian market, the iShares MSCI Russia ETF (ERUS), fell from a peak of more than $50 in October 2021 to less than $18 in February 2022 and then finally to $8.06 when trading was halted. Choosing the right global ETF for your portfolio will depend on your goals. A few global ETFs are available. Some, like the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT), own American and foreign stocks. Investors who want to own domestic and international stocks can use this fund. Over the past 10 years, VT has had an annualized return of 8.07%, slightly lower than its benchmark of 8.17%. ETFs that invest in both the U.S. and foreign markets are often heavily weighted toward American stocks. Other funds, like the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF (ACWX), only hold shares in non-American companies. These funds are worthwhile for investors with exposure to American businesses and who want to add stocks from elsewhere in their portfolios. Over the past decade, ACWX has had annualized returns of 3.70%. Its returns are lower than VT because of the strength of the U.S. markets compared with international markets in recent years. Some funds focus on one or a few specific countries. For example, the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund (DXJ) concentrates on the Japanese market, employing hedging strategies to limit its currency risk. This fund has had returns of 9.97% over the past 10 years. Once you know the type of ETF you\u2019re looking for, you\u2019ll have to do some market research. Are you just looking for broad exposure to international markets, or do you want to focus on a specific country, a group of nations, or a region? Many of the same factors apply as when investing in domestic ETFs. Review the expense ratios, how well they track their benchmark index, and their trading volume to ensure liquidity. When researching global ETFs, you need to understand the fund\u2019s holdings. For example, is the fund focused on a specific country? Does it aim to track the performance of a major index like the Nikkei 225 or the Hang Seng, and if so, what is its tracking error? If tracking an index, assess the fund\u2019s tracking error to gauge how closely it mirrors the index\u2019s performance. Reviewing the index that a fund tracks is essential. Does it represent large-cap companies like the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or does it offer a broader view of a country\u2019s large companies, like the S&P 500? Knowing this is vital because the performance of large-cap companies in foreign markets often differs significantly from that of smaller caps within the same markets. Investigate the fund\u2019s specific holdings, which should be readily available, to understand the shares it owns and its weighting strategy. Also, examine whether the fund employs derivatives to hedge against currency risk. While hedging can mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on global ETFs, it usually incurs extra costs. There are a few ways to invest in global ETFs. One popular strategy for buy-and-hold investors is to use a total market fund, like VT, to gain exposure to domestic and foreign businesses. These funds are usually weighted by market cap, so you gain more exposure to the U.S. market, the largest in the world, and some exposure to other markets. Other investors want to focus on specific countries or groups of countries. If, for example, you think that Brazil has a growing economy and is poised to outperform, you might look for an ETF focused on the Brazilian market to get exposure to that nation\u2019s stocks. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that diversification is key for all investing. Adding international ETFs to your portfolio can add diversification. However, if you invest in only one country, this is risky. If the nation you invest in goes through a recession or its currency drops in value, you could lose a significant amount. Buying shares in an ETF that focuses on several countries or multiple ETFs, so you have exposure to different countries, can cut that risk. Once you\u2019ve decided on your strategy, you\u2019re ready to start investing in global ETFs. Then, you can select specific funds to invest in and place orders to buy your shares. Global ETF investing has many of the same risks as investing in domestic funds, such as market volatility, but it also brings many unique challenges to keep in mind. One is that you will likely know less about another country\u2019s market and its operations. If you\u2019re an American investor, you interact with American business daily, follow American news, and understand the opportunities and risks that each business and industry faces. When investing in another country, you\u2019re less familiar with its markets, meaning you\u2019ll have to spend far more time researching investment options. You\u2019ll also face regulatory risk. Sometimes, your government blocks trade or investing in a foreign country\u2019s stocks. That country might also impose regulations that affect the value of your investments. Inadequate regulations in the foreign market could mean a greater chance of fraud that affects your investment. Currency risk is also a concern. If the dollar gets stronger or the value of the other country\u2019s currency falls, your investment could lose value unless the fund uses hedging strategies. To limit these risks, it\u2019s important to build a diverse portfolio that doesn\u2019t focus too heavily on a specific country\u2019s stocks and to spend time researching potential investments before you commit. When investing outside the United States, taxes can be complicated. The U.S. collects taxes on your profits from foreign investments. However, every country has unique tax laws, so you\u2019ll have to deal with tax laws both in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. offers a foreign tax credit and has tax treaties with some nations that can mitigate the effect of foreign taxes. Investing by using ETFs can also help reduce some of this complexity. Depending on the agreements between the U.S. and the foreign country, the fund can reclaim some of the taxes paid, saving individual investors from dealing with foreign taxes on their own. You must still pay the Internal Revenue Service for capital gains and dividend payments, even if the fund recovers taxes paid to foreign entities. To remain tax efficient, you should try to hold investments for at least a year to pay the lower rates for long-term capital gains. Investing in a tax-advantaged account, such as an individual retirement account or a 401(k), can also help limit or defer your taxes. This strategy is especially popular when investing in income-producing funds that pay regular dividends. Investing in global ETFs has been a winning strategy for many investors. For example, in a one-year period starting from Jan. 18, 2023, the Franklin FTSE Taiwan ETF (FLTW), which invests in the Taiwanese market, produced a return of 30.10%. That beat the return of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which had a return of 26.33%. This strong performance is in part because of the success of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Limited (TSM), which has had a price increase of about 200% over five years. Successful international investors can identify markets that are undervalued or poised to grow significantly. For instance, an investor foreseeing several years ago the rising demand for semiconductors and Taiwan\u2019s position as a major producer (more than 60% of the world supply) would have done well by investing in the Taiwanese market. Investors who want to get exposure to global markets have many options other than ETFs. For example, investors could trade American depositary receipts, which are a way for foreign companies to access the American market, buy foreign shares over-the-counter, or even trade directly on a foreign stock market. Emerging markets and frontier markets are both names for what are considered smaller, less-developed countries. Generally, emerging markets are those considered less economically developed, such as India, Mexico, or Saudi Arabia. Frontier markets are considered even less developed and thus might pose more risk. It\u2019s important to do your own research to find the right ETFs for your needs, but some of the most popular emerging market ETFs include the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) and the iShares MSCI BIC ETF (BKF). BlackRock is the largest ETF provider globally, with about 425 ETFs offered and more than $3 trillion under management. Global ETF investments are exposed to currency fluctuations because they typically use local currency. If that currency\u2019s value changes compared with the dollar, the value of that fund in dollar terms will also change. Some funds use hedging techniques to limit this risk. Global ETFs are an option for investors who want to diversify their portfolios and gain exposure to non-American companies. While investing internationally can be risky, it can also offer valuable rewards. Before investing, research different funds and consider how they meet your portfolio needs, investment goals, and risk tolerance.

Brazil exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have holdings that can include companies of different sizes and sectors, providing a convenient way to invest in Brazil\u2019s financial markets. Brazil exchange-traded funds (ETFs) trade on stock exchanges, much like stocks, and hold assets (such as stocks or bonds) from Brazilian entities. They offer a way for non-Brazilian investors to speculate in Latin America\u2019s largest economy. Brazil is also an\u00a0emerging market, and investments in Brazil can further diversify a portfolio. With a gross domestic product (GDP) of $1.92 trillion as of 2022, Brazil has the 11th-largest economy in the world, surpassing Australia, South Korea, and Mexico. This reflects Brazil\u2019s vast natural resources, diverse industrial base, and large workforce. It also marks a vast increase in 20 years; its GDP was $509 billion in 2002. However, Brazil\u2019s per-capita GDP in 2022 was just under $9,000, 101st in the world. This disparity between the overall size of the economy and the wealth of most Brazilians highlights the challenges of uneven economic development within the country. As a major commodities exporter, Brazil\u2019s economy and financial markets are susceptible to global commodity booms and busts. The strength or weakness of the Brazilian real (BRL) vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar also affects the country\u2019s exporters. Brazil\u2019s high benchmark interest rate, the SELIC rate, also affects equities trading. Brazil\u2019s fiscal reforms, trade pacts, and privatization also affect investor sentiment. Finally, credit downgrades by rating agencies, like Brazil\u2019s loss of investment grade status in 2015, can diminish foreign investment in the country. The main Brazilian stock exchange, the B3 (for Brasil, Bolsa, and Balc\u00e3o), is also the largest in Latin America, with a market capitalization of $913,387.25 million as of January 2024. Formed in 2008 from the merger of BM&F Bovespa and Cetip, the B3 is headquartered in S\u00e3o Paulo. As of January 2024, over 352 companies\u2019 stocks and more than 2,619 companies from all major industries are listed on the B3 and trade electronically on its platforms. In addition to stocks, the exchange also offers trading in options, futures, forwards, and Brazilian depositary receipts, allowing non-Brazilian companies to list shares on the B3 exchange. The benchmark equity index in Brazil is the Ibovespa, which was first formed in 1968. The index tracks around 80 of the largest and most liquid Brazilian stocks weighted by market cap. Other notable B3 indexes include the Brazil 100 Index, the Brazil 50 Index, the Brazil Broad-Based Index, and various sector-specific indexes. The S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange is a stock and over-the-counter (OTC) market based in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Founded in 1890 as Bolsa de\u00a0Valores de\u00a0S\u00e3o\u00a0Paulo (BOVESPA), it is now part of B3, SA. As of 2024, six Brazil ETFs trade on American exchanges (excluding leveraged and inverse ETFs). Choosing a suitable Brazil ETF involves reviewing several key criteria: expense ratios, bid-ask spreads, trading volume, dividend yields, and the index or asset class tracked. Each plays a crucial role in determining the suitability of an ETF for your investment goals. When evaluating these criteria, consider your investment goals, risk tolerance, and overall market conditions. For example, if you prioritize low costs, then you might focus on ETFs with lower expense ratios. Conversely, if your goal is to achieve more liquidity, then look for ETFs with high trading volumes and narrow bid-ask spreads. When considering an investment in Brazil ETFs, you\u2019ll need to assess several critical factors that can significantly influence your investment\u2019s performance and how it aligns with your financial goals: Investing in Brazil does carry risks, but it can be done safely to enhance a diversified portfolio by following prudent investment principles: Most brokerage platforms routinely offer Brazil ETFs. Simply research and identify which ETFs interest you, and then use your broker\u2019s order entry tool to trade. Note that many brokerages now offer commission-free trading in ETFs. Yes, there are ETFs listed on Brazil\u2019s B3 stock exchange. Investors can access a variety of ETFs that cover different sectors and investment strategies. These ETFs provide a chance to invest in the Brazilian market through a diversified and often more cost-effective approach than direct stock investments. The specific ETFs available on B3 cater to different investment needs and preferences, allowing Brazil-based investors to choose according to their investment goals and risk tolerance\u200b. Brazil ETFs offer several benefits over picking individual Brazilian stocks or American depositary receipts (ADRs) for your portfolio. Brazil ETFs offer instant diversification across dozens or even hundreds of holdings, reducing company-specific risks. They enable participation in the broader Brazilian stock market rather than trying to choose a handful of winning stocks. Moreover, U.S.-based brokers may not offer access directly to Brazilian stock markets, and not all Brazilian companies of interest may have ADRs traded on American exchanges. Even if such access exists, these ETFs cut the administrative hassle of directly owning foreign shares. Combining diversification, liquidity, transparency, low costs, and currency hedging capabilities, Brazil ETFs possess many advantages over picking individual Brazilian stocks and ADRs. That would be its rich natural resources and diversified economy. The country is a major global producer of commodities like soybeans, corn, coffee, sugar, and beef. It also has significant mineral reserves, including iron ore, gold, and bauxite. Additionally, Brazil has made ample investments in renewable energy, with a substantial part of its energy matrix coming from hydro, wind, and biomass sources. The industrial sector, particularly in steel production, and the service sector, which accounts for a large part of its GDP, are also key contributors to Brazil\u2019s wealth\u200b. Brazil ETFs offer a good option for American investors who want geographic diversification to the Brazilian markets, with their unique dynamics and opportunities. However, understanding the nuances of the Brazilian market, recognizing the risks involved, and aligning them with your investment strategy is crucial.

            "title": "Copper ETFs: What They Are and How They Work",
            "content": "Investopedia / Julie Bang While not a precious metal like gold or silver, copper is an important metal used for everyday purposes, including electrical wiring, piping, motors, construction, and coins. Some investors would like to add copper to their portfolios, but physically owning the metal involves shipping and storing heavy material. Instead, many turn to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to gain exposure to this market. There are a few types of copper ETFs, and it\u2019s important to consider the pros and cons of copper before investing in them. Copper ETFs are designed to allow you to invest in the copper market without physically owning and storing the metal. Instead, you can buy shares in the ETF like in any other ETF or stock. The fund\u2019s managers then work to ensure that the fund\u2019s price moves in line with the price of copper, either by physically buying the metal or using derivatives to mimic the price movement. Copper has become more popular with investors as demand has increased. For example, BlackRock, a major provider of funds and ETFs, launched its copper ETF in June 2023 because of the growing popularity. Copper is an essential commodity because it has many applications in industries such as technology and construction. You likely have dozens of devices and other products with copper near you right now. One important use for copper is in electrical wiring. Most modern homes have copper wiring and may use copper plumbing because of its efficient electric conductivity. Copper is also used for heating and cooling systems, telephone and internet cables, and motors. Copper is also suitable for alloying. Combined with zinc, tin, or nickel, it can be used to create materials like brass, bronze, and nickel that have applications in building large ships or musical instruments. Because of its ability to predict economic turning points, copper is sometimes called \u201cDr. Copper.\u201d Investors follow its price and use it as a leading indicator of the global economy. If demand for copper falls, causing the price to drop, it may suggest weakening demand in the global economy. Here are some things to review that influence the price of copper: Significant copper providers include Chile, Peru, China, and the United States. Copper ETFs come in a few different forms. Some aim to track the value of the commodity, while others also track the performance of companies in the industry, such as copper mining firms. Given that the success of copper-producing businesses is closely tied to the value of copper, the price of copper plays a big role in how the ETFs perform. For example, the iShares Copper and Metals Mining ETF (ICOP) holds shares in companies like Freeport-McMoRan Inc. and Grupo M\u00e9xico, major producers of copper. Meanwhile, the United States Copper Index Fund (CPER) tracks the price of copper directly. It does not invest in companies that mine or produce copper. Instead, it uses futures contracts to mimic its price changes. Before investing in a copper ETF, you should consider both the benefits and the risks of the metal. Diversification Highly liquid Secular bull market Price may fall in an economic downturn Other ETFs you own may already have exposure to copper Volatility A significant benefit of investing in copper ETFs is diversification. Many investors focus on securities like stocks and bonds. Exposure to a commodity adds a new asset class to your portfolio, further diversifying your investments. ETFs are also highly liquid. You can buy or sell shares in a copper ETF whenever the market is open, so it\u2019s easy to add to your investment or to cash out as needed. Some investors also think that demand for copper will continue to rise. That, combined with the fact that the supply of copper is not growing as fast, means that it might increase in price over the long term. A key risk of investing in copper is that the value of the metal is closely tied to the overall state of the global economy. It may not provide as much diversification as you desire. You may also have some exposure to the metal already if you own index funds, because those funds own shares in copper miners and other copper-related businesses. Copper prices can also be volatile. From January 2019 to January 2024, copper swung in price drastically. Starting at about $6,000 per 1,000 kilograms, it fell to less than $4,800 at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic before spiking to more than $10,500 in 2021. It later fell back to almost $7,000 and sits around $8,250 as of this writing. Some months saw price swings of more than $1,000. That level of volatility can be difficult for investors to handle. If you need to sell your investment to cover other expenses, you may be forced to sell at a loss because of volatility. There are three main types of copper ETFs. Each aims to track the value of copper but works in slightly different ways, so consider the pros and cons of each approach before you select a fund. Physically backed commodity ETFs hold the actual commodity\u2014in this case, copper. The benefit is that you can expect the fund to track the value of copper because it owns the metal. However, the cost of shipping, receiving, and storing the metal can be high, so these funds may have high fees. Equity ETFs focus on owning shares in businesses related to the copper industry. For example, the iShares Copper and Metals Mining ETF owns shares in mining businesses. These funds may have lower expense ratios than those of physically backed ETFs because it\u2019s cheaper and easier to own shares in businesses than to buy and store physical metals. However, while the fate of copper mining and other related companies is tied to the price of copper, they may not mimic the price of copper as closely. Futures-based ETFs rely on derivatives, primarily futures, to mimic changes in the price of copper. The benefit of this strategy is that, when executed correctly, the fund\u2019s price movements should match the movements of copper. However, the fund is exposed to additional derivatives risks, including rolling risks, as they move futures into new contracts. They may also have fewer tax advantages if they\u2019re a limited partnership. When investing in copper ETFs, you need to study many of the same factors that you\u2019d consider when investing in other ETFs, as well as a few specific to copper. The first thing to look at is the expense ratio of the ETF. As a percentage of your invested assets, you\u2019ll pay this amount for investing in the ETF. The higher the expense ratio, the more it costs to invest, so look for a fund with a lower expense ratio. Nevertheless, this is one aspect of an ETF; a poorly managed fund with a lower expense ratio could cost more in the long run. The size of the fund is also important. ETFs with more assets and trading volume will be more liquid. That means it\u2019s easier to buy and sell shares in the fund. Investing in a fund with few assets and low liquidity may mean it will be harder to sell your shares or there will be a wider bid-ask spread. For commodity ETFs, it\u2019s important to consider the type of fund you\u2019re investing in. Do you prefer a futures-based ETF or an equity ETF, with all the pros and cons that either choice entails? You should also look into the ETF\u2019s tracking error, which is the difference between its price movements and the price movements of copper as a commodity. If your goal is to get exposure to the price of copper, look for funds with fewer tracking errors. If you\u2019re looking to invest in a copper ETF, consider these funds: The United States Copper Index Fund (CPER) is a futures-based ETF that aims to track the change in price of copper, minus the fund\u2019s expenses. The fund has the highest expense ratio of the three funds highlighted, at 0.97%. This means that investors will pay more to invest through the fund. It is also relatively small, with assets of just over $121 million, so trading volume can be low. The iShares Copper and Metals Mining ETF (ICOP) is an equity-based fund. It aims to give investors exposure to copper by owning shares in businesses related to copper, including mining businesses. Its benchmark index includes both American and non-American businesses, so investors get exposure to the global copper industry. The fund is smaller than CPER, with less than $5 million in assets. This may be explained by its relatively young age. The fund was started in June 2023. Though its lack of assets is a concern and could mean liquidity is low, it has the lowest expense ratio of these highlighted funds, at 0.47%. That could make it appealing to investors looking for a low-cost way to get exposure to copper. The Global X Copper Miners ETF is the largest of these three funds, with $1.35 billion in assets under management. Like ICOP, COPX is an equity-based ETF, owning shares in copper miners and related businesses. The expense ratio of the fund is a middle point between the two other funds highlighted, at 0.65%. Because this fund has the most assets, it\u2019s likely to be more liquid than the other two funds on this list. That could make it appeal to investors who wish to make more frequent trades and who do not want to deal with low trade volume. To start investing in copper ETFs, follow these steps: To invest in ETFs of any kind, you\u2019ll need a brokerage account. Opening a brokerage account is relatively easy and can be completed online. To select a broker, consider things like account minimums, fees, and ease of use. Once you\u2019ve chosen your preferred broker, you can open an account from the broker\u2019s website. During the process, you\u2019ll need to provide some personal information, like your address and Social Security number. You\u2019ll also have to link a bank account that you can use to fund the brokerage account. Once you\u2019ve opened a brokerage account, you\u2019ll need to fund it with the money you want to invest. Some brokers will let you place orders and pull the money directly from a linked bank account, while others will make you deposit it to your brokerage account first. Each broker has a different process for funding your account, but it usually involves making an online transfer to send money to your brokerage account\u2019s settlement fund. This is usually a money market fund that you can draw money from to buy securities. After funding your brokerage account, you\u2019ll need to choose an ETF to invest in. Be sure to consider each fund\u2019s pros and cons, expense ratio, and whether it tracks the price of copper effectively. Finally, it\u2019s time to place an order to buy shares in your selected ETF. Each brokerage has a different process for placing a buy order, but you\u2019ll typically specify the ETF and number of shares you want to buy. You can use either a market order or a limit order. Market orders buy shares immediately at the best available price, while limit orders allow you to limit how much you\u2019ll pay per share, but the risk is that the order may not fill if the price does not get to the limit you have set. Using a limit order may be safer for low-volume ETFs, like some copper ETFs. If fewer shares are available, a market order could lead to you paying more than expected. Investing does involve taxes, so it\u2019s important to have a plan for dealing with them. If the fund you invest in pays dividends, the tax treatment of those dividends will depend on whether they are qualified dividends or unqualified dividends. Qualified dividends are those paid by a U.S. or qualifying foreign company whose shares you held for at least 60 days during the 121-day period that began 60 days before the ex-dividend date and ends 60 days after the ex-dividend date. All other dividends are unqualified. Qualified dividends are taxed at the lower long-term capital gains rate, while unqualified dividends are taxed at your regular income tax rate. When you sell your shares, you\u2019ll deal with capital gains taxes. If you earn a profit from the sale, you\u2019ll pay tax on the gains. If you hold the shares for more than one year, you\u2019ll pay long-term capital gains, which can be 0%, 15%, or 20%, based on your income. Profits from shares held for a year or less are taxed at your normal income tax rate. Your broker should report your dividends and gains to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and provide you with tax forms such as 1099-DIV and 1099-B. You can then report your capital gains and dividend income to the IRS when filing your annual tax return. Copper ETFs can track the price of copper by using derivatives, including future contracts. They may also hold shares in copper-related businesses, such as mining businesses. The performance of these companies is closely tied to the value of copper, so their prices will move similarly. Some investors think that metals like copper can be a good hedge against inflation because of their fixed supply. Historically, the price of copper has been volatile but positively correlated with inflation, so it might serve as an effective hedge. Many investors consider copper a wise investment because of its limited supply and critical role in many modern industries, including electronics and construction. Before investing in copper, it\u2019s essential to research the pros and cons of investing in the metal and to do your due diligence. Copper is expensive because it has many industrial uses, such as electronics, motors, and plumbing. The supply of the metal is limited, which, combined with high demand, helps keep its price high. Each metal has pros and cons as an investment. Copper is cheaper than silver overall and has many industrial uses, but silver has a long history as a precious metal. Before investing in either, consider the pros and cons of each and whether the investment will help you achieve your investing goals. Copper ETFs allow you to invest in the copper market without buying and storing the actual metal. If you want to add diversification to your portfolio by investing in commodities, ETFs can be an option. Before investing, however, consider the pros and cons and think about whether a futures-based or equity-based ETF is suitable for you.

            "content": "Adam Hayes, Ph.D., CFA, is a financial writer with 15+ years Wall Street experience as a derivatives trader. Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master's in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology.

Gold ETFs are exchange-traded funds with broad exposure to the gold industry. They represent real positions in gold, either physically or through companies in the sector. Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and gold mining ETFs invest in either gold itself or gold mining companies. Both offer a way to diversify, invest in gold, and benefit from higher prices. The key difference is in what assets these ETFs hold. Gold ETFs invest directly in physical gold bullion or use derivatives contracts to gain indirect exposure. Gold mining ETFs invest in the stocks of gold mining companies. As with other ETFs, gold ETFs and gold mining ETFs trade like shares of stock and are listed on the major stock exchanges. This means investors can buy and sell these ETFs throughout the day with low or no commissions. For gold ETFs, each share represents a fixed amount of gold stored securely in a vault controlled by the ETF manager. They give investors exposure to the price of gold without owning the physical metal directly. Meanwhile, gold mining ETF shares represent ownership in a portfolio of gold mining firms, and their performance is tied to the profits of extracting and refining gold and broader stock market trends. Physical gold ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) own gold bullion stored in vaults in London, New York, Canada, and other safe jurisdictions. Each ETF share represents fractional ownership of the underlying gold. Some issuers offer a \u201cmini\u201d version of the ETF with a lower share price for smaller investors. For example, one share of GLD represents 1/10 of one ounce of gold, while the \u201cmini\u201d version of GLD, GLDM, holds 1/50, making it a more affordable option for those looking to invest in gold without committing too much money. The metal is audited and insured for physical gold ETFs to confirm its bona fides. These ETFs regularly publish lists of their gold holdings, and for investors, they have fewer fees and other costs than storing the gold themselves. Synthetic gold ETFs instead use derivatives like futures and options contracts to track the price of gold rather than owning physical gold. This can lower expenses but adds counterparty and other potential risks. Some gold ETFs may employ derivative contracts for leverage (e.g., two- or three-times returns) or inverse returns (i.e., the ETF\u2019s price falls when the gold\u2019s value rises). Many gold ETFs track the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) gold price, which replaced the London Gold Fix in 2015 and is the global benchmark based on auctions between large gold traders and refiners. Other benchmarks include the Bloomberg Gold Subindex and futures prices on the COMEX in the United States. Investors should be aware that storage and insurance costs are factored into the ETF\u2019s expense ratio. Also, owning shares in these ETFs doesn\u2019t mean you own a specific piece of gold; instead, you own a portion of the entire gold stockpile held by the ETF. Gold mining ETFs hold a basket of publicly traded gold mining stocks and related companies. Their portfolios typically include miners focusing on gold exploration, production, and processing. By owning shares of gold mining firms, the ETFs provide equity exposure to the industry rather than the price of gold itself. While these companies\u2019 profits are often tied to the price of spot gold, owning shares in them exposes investors to the operational risks, costs, labor issues, and geological uncertainty involved in gold mining operations. Many gold mining ETFs hold a broad portfolio of gold producers, but some focus on so-called junior gold mining firms. These are smaller companies exploring or in early production, working to identify and prove gold deposits. The rationale for carving out specific ETFs for them is that junior firms have more upside potential and more risk. As gold prices rise, junior firms may see greater growth as they produce new reserves. However, junior mining companies are less diversified in their operations, often with weaker balance sheets and higher failure rates. The primary benefit of gold ETFs is that they expose investors to gold more easily than traditional methods. Owning gold can help diversify a portfolio and provide a hedge against inflation. ETF shares are highly liquid and can be bought and sold daily on the open market, making it easy to adjust a portfolio\u2019s gold exposure when needed. ETFs are also transparent\u2014the holdings are published daily, and their costs are clearly stated in prospectuses. Physical gold ETFs are also subject to audit, a crucial peace-of-mind measure given the problems of fraud that have plagued the industry back to the earliest gold coins. While gold mining stocks and their ETFs may pay dividends, most gold ETFs do not do so or provide interest income. However, exceptions like the FT Vest Gold Strategy Target income ETF (IGLD) financially engineer an income flow. Precious metals and the companies that mine them can be highly volatile, especially the younger firms. As such, gold ETFs and gold mining ETFs may not be well-suited for conservative investors seeking wealth preservation. Gold ETFs and gold mining ETFs are readily available through brokerage firms. Simply research and identify the particular ETF that interests you and then load that ticker symbol into your broker\u2019s order entry platform. Today, many brokers offer commission-free trading in ETFs. ETFs provide more liquidity, lower costs, and storage ease than owning physical gold. However, physical gold allows true ownership while ETF holders only experience indirect exposure through the fund. ETFs are also simpler with full asset backing than when trading futures, which also have inherent leverage/contango considerations. Investing in gold vs. gold ETFs depends on individual investment goals, risk tolerance, and preferences. Both options have advantages and drawbacks. Physical gold can be held and stored, offering a sense of security to many investors. Owning physical gold also means there are none of the risks associated with the management or performance of a fund. However, extensive holdings of physical gold require secure storage and insurance, which can be costly and cumbersome. Selling physical gold can also be less convenient and take more time than selling shares of an ETF. Yes, gold ETFs can be held in a retirement account like a traditional or Roth IRA. This is beneficial, since holding physical gold in an IRA requires a special gold IRA, which has its own rules and fees. Both gold ETFs and gold mining ETFs provide ordinary investors with an accessible and cost-effective way to diversify into gold. Gold ETFs that hold physical gold track the price of gold, while gold mining ETFs hold stocks engaged in the gold mining industry. Choosing which is best for your portfolio depends on your needs, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Regardless of which you choose, be sure to pay attention to expense ratios, liquidity measures, benchmarks, and the portfolio of ETF holdings.

            "title": "Platinum ETFs: What They Are and How They Work",
            "content": "Platinum ETFs are exchange-traded funds that provide exposure to the platinum industry. They offer either real positions in platinum or through firms in the sector. Platinum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investments with exposure to the platinum market. These funds track the price of platinum through physical holdings or financial derivatives, offering an avenue for portfolio diversification. Platinum ETFs let you invest in the platinum market without physically owning the metal. These funds track the price of platinum. For physical ETFs, each share represents a certain quantity of platinum stored in a secure vault, with the ETF trustee overseeing its management. Meanwhile, derivative-based ETFs use futures contracts to replicate the performance of platinum. As investors trade shares, the fund\u2019s net asset value fluctuates with platinum\u2019s market price. The value of these shares should correlate with platinum\u2019s prevailing market price. It\u2019s an efficient way of investing in platinum, offering liquidity and simplicity since you can trade shares in an ETF more easily than buying or selling the metal. Investing in platinum ETFs has several key benefits. First, they provide direct exposure to platinum prices without the need to store and insure the physical platinum at a significant cost. Second, they offer high liquidity, as these ETFs are traded on an exchange like stocks, allowing investors to buy or sell shares anytime during market hours. Third, they enable portfolio diversification. Since platinum often moves differently from other commodities or equities, it can be a hedge against market volatility. Investing in platinum ETFs requires careful consideration. You should see whether the ETF holds physical platinum or uses futures contracts. The former offers direct exposure, while the latter involves more complexity. You\u2019ll also want to review the fund\u2019s liquidity. Higher trading volumes should mean it\u2019s easier to buy and sell shares. Next, consider expense ratios since lower ratios could be better for your pocket, particularly for long-term investments. Nevertheless, lower fees in a fund not managed well will cost you more in the long run. Lastly, check the fund\u2019s tracking error\u2014that is, how closely it follows the price of platinum. Remember, diversification is critical. Platinum ETFs can add a unique element to your portfolio but shouldn\u2019t be out of proportion in your overall portfolio. Two of the largest platinum ETFs are the abrdn Physical Platinum Shares ETF (PPLT) and GraniteShares Platinum Trust (PLTM). As of January 2024, the largest platinum ETF is PPLT, with about $920 million in assets, followed by PLTM, which also has a significant asset base of about $920 million. The abrdn Physical Platinum Shares ETF (PPLT) has an expense ratio of 0.60%. GraniteShares Platinum Trust (PLTM) has an expense ratio of 0.50%. Before placing any investment, you\u2019ll need to conduct careful due diligence. Investing in these ETFs carries inherent risks, primarily market volatility. Platinum prices fluctuate significantly, often more than gold or silver, leading to potential losses or emotional stress. Investors must consider supply-demand changes of this metal since it\u2019s rarer and usually more sensitive to market changes. The price of platinum is significantly influenced by its use in the automotive sector. When automobile sales are up, the value of platinum goes up. It is also a platinum group metal, as is palladium. Essentially, when palladium prices increase, industrial manufacturers might switch to platinum, which, though usually more costly, is more efficient for specific uses. Platinum is extracted from ore deposits, often alongside nickel and copper ores. The main sources of platinum are in South Africa, followed by Zimbabwe and Russia. Troubles in those areas, such as an electricity shortage in South Africa that sent platinum to its all-time high in 2008, can cause a spike in prices. Often, its price is given in troy ounces (a unit of measure that dates to the Middle Ages in Troyes, France), which is about 31.10 grams. While these ETFs remove the need for physical ownership of platinum, they are subject to market risk like any other investment. Economic factors, substitution threats, and environmental concerns can also pose challenges. They offer liquidity, allowing easy trading. Generally, they have lower trading fees and transaction costs than with physical platinum. They have ease of investment without the need to physically possess platinum. Dependence on industrial demand can lead to price volatility. Generally, they do not generate steady income, which is disadvantageous for income-seeking investors. They have the potential for underperformance during economic downturns. Investing in platinum ETFs is a relatively straightforward process accessible to seasoned and novice investors. First, you\u2019ll need to have an investment account. This can be done through a brokerage firm or an online trading platform. Once your account is active, you can then buy shares in a platinum ETF of your choice. You can do this directly from the stock exchange where the ETF is listed or through your broker. Always remember to conduct due diligence before investing. The attractiveness of investing in any ETFs lies in their simplicity. It\u2019s akin to buying shares of a company. But instead of owning a part of a company, you\u2019re essentially owning a fraction of a portfolio that tracks the price of platinum. Platinum bullion coins are minted by governments and private mints and are made of pure platinum. They\u2019re often bought for direct ownership of platinum and as collectors\u2019 items. Platinum is rarer and has more industrial uses, particularly in automotive catalytic converters, making its price more sensitive to industrial demand and supply disruptions. Gold, meanwhile, is often seen as a safe-haven asset, with its price typically driven by macroeconomic factors and investor sentiment during economic uncertainties. Silver straddles both industrial demand and investment appeal. Platinum\u2019s rarity and industrial utility can lead to higher volatility and potential for growth, but also greater risk, than the often more stable markets for gold and silver. The choice between platinum bars and ETFs depends on your investment needs, goals, and risk tolerance. Bars offer tangible ownership, while ETFs provide ease of trading, diversification, and lower storage costs. Platinum ETFs are a more straightforward way to tap into the platinum market without physically owning the metal. These investment instruments have clear advantages, such as ease of trading and portfolio diversification. However, potential downsides include price volatility and management costs. Before investing in these types of ETFs, it\u2019s crucial to carefully assess the market conditions, the historical performance of the ETF, and your personal risk tolerance. As with any investment, there\u2019s always a degree of risk involved, so thorough research and careful consideration of your financial objectives are essential. etf.com. \u201cPlatinum ETFs.\u201d VettaFi, ETF Database. \u201cPlatinum ETF List.\u201d abrdn. \u201cabrdn Physical Platinum Shares ETF.\u201d GraniteShares. \u201cPLTM: GraniteShares Platinum Trust.\u201d Zijing Zhang and Hong-Kun Zhang, via ScienceDirect. \u201cThe Dynamics of Precious Metal Markets VaR: A GARCHEVT Approach.\u201d Journal of Commodity Markets, Vol. 4, No. 1 (2016), Pages 14\u201327.

            "title": "ETF vs. Investment Trust: What\u2019s the Difference?",
            "content": "ETFs are open-end funds while investment trusts are closed-end funds Rockaa / Getty Images Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and investment trusts are two popular investment products, each with specific characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. The primary difference between them is how they\u2019re structured. Investment trusts are closed-end funds with a fixed number of shares set at an initial public offering (IPO). ETFs are open-end funds, and their shares are created or redeemed based on investor demand. An ETF is an investment security that's similar to a mutual fund in that it invests in a basket of securities. However, unlike mutual funds, it trades on an exchange and can be bought or sold like a stock. ETFs aim to track a particular index, sector, commodity, or other asset. ETFs have become popular because they offer flexibility and are cost-effective. They can be used in a variety of investment strategies, from passive index tracking to actively managed portfolios. ETFs can offer diversified exposure to specific asset classes, currencies, sectors, or indexes while trading on exchanges like individual stocks. ETFs are open-end funds, which means that their management can create or redeem shares based on investor demand. This should keep their share price in line with the net asset value (NAV) of their underlying assets. Larger ETFs have substantial\u00a0assets under management (AUM)\u00a0and a high\u00a0trading volume, which should keep management fees and trading costs low. For example, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has an expense ratio of 0.09% and turns over almost 10.9 million shares daily. In addition, ETFs disclose their portfolio holdings daily, offering transparency. U.S. ETFs accounted for 28.2% of total equity trading volume on U.S. exchanges in the third quarter of 2023. Investment trusts, also called closed-end funds, pool resources from multiple investors to buy a portfolio of assets. Assets might include equities, commodities, fixed-income securities, or real estate. As closed-end funds, investment trusts issue a fixed number of shares at inception that doesn\u2019t change. This has several effects: Independent boards or trustees oversee the management of investment trusts. They are expected to adhere to the trust\u2019s objectives and act as an added layer of governance. Investment trusts can adopt active or passive investment strategies and cater to income-seeking or growth-oriented investors. Some jurisdictions grant tax advantages to investment trusts, enhancing their tax efficiency. While investment trusts can offer valuable diversification and investment opportunities, they have risks. Therefore, investors should assess their financial goals and risk tolerance before including them in their portfolios. ETFs and investment trusts are both common investment vehicles, but they have significant differences in their structure, management, and tax efficiency. 1. ETFs are managed investment funds that aim to mirror the performance of a specific index or asset class. They trade on stock exchanges, providing investors with greater liquidity and flexibility. By contrast, investment trusts are closed-end funds with a fixed number of shares and can trade at a premium or discount to their NAV. This can create unique opportunities and risks. 2. While investment trusts also trade on exchanges, they typically have a lower volume of trade, which could increase trading costs. 3. Management styles differ substantially between ETFs and investment trusts. Large ETFs that track bellwether stock indexes, such as the S&P 500, typically have ultra-low management fees because of their passive approach. Investment trusts tend to be more actively managed, requiring the expertise of a skilled investment manager to navigate market conditions. Investment trusts also regularly borrow money to invest, which can enhance returns but also amplify losses. 4. These investment products have differing tax implications. ETFs are usually more tax-efficient since capital gains can be minimized through their creations and redemptions. Investment trusts, however, may distribute capital gains, creating a tax liability. While both ETFs and investment trusts can offer diversified investment choices, understanding their key differences can help you make more informed investment decisions aligned with your financial goals. Greater liquidity and flexibility because they trade like stocks Higher trading volume Often have lower trading costs May be passively managed and therefore have lower expense costs Tax-efficient Closed end-funds Lower trading volume May have higher trading costs Will usually be actively managed and have higher management fees May be less tax-efficient Spot bitcoin ETFs, which began trading for the first time in the United States in January 2024, can have higher management fees than traditional ETFs. In a surprise move, on May 23, 2024, the SEC paved the way for ETF issuers to potentially list ETFs tied to the price of ether by approving applications from the NYSE, CBOE, and Nasdaq to list these products on their exchanges. Both can be suitable as long-term investments. Some investors prefer ETFs for their lower costs and index-tracking nature, making them potentially better for passive, long-term strategies. With their fixed share structure, investment trusts can be suitable for long-term investors looking for potential income sources and who can handle price fluctuations when the shares go above or below NAV. ETFs and investment trusts have distinct management styles. ETFs often passively track an index, a buy-and-hold approach which involves minimal decision making by fund managers. By contrast, investment trusts frequently follow active management strategies, with fund managers actively selecting and adjusting the portfolio in an attempt to outperform the market. Investment trusts may also use leverage, which can add to the active management of a fund. Yes. Investment trusts have potentially higher dividend yields, partly because of their ability to use leverage and the income-focused strategies often employed by fund managers. ETFs can pay dividends, too, but their yields derive from their underlying assets. An ETF geared toward capturing value from increases in stock prices typically provides less in dividends. Yes. Certain ETFs and investment trusts zero in on quite specific markets or themes. For example, some focus on emerging or specialized fields like esports, space exploration, biotechnology, blockchain, or clean energy technology. There are geographically targeted ETFs and investment trusts, some regions of which might be underrepresented in mainstream investment funds. These funds can be a great opportunity to put your money into areas and themes that you\u2019re passionate about. However, they also have their own risks, including potentially higher volatility and setbacks associated with a tight investment focus. ETFs and investment trusts differ in their structure and management. ETFs are open-end funds, allowing for more efficient trading close to their NAV. They can offer diversified exposure across various asset classes and are frequently passively managed, leading to lower management fees. By contrast, investment trusts have a closed-end structure, issuing a fixed number of shares at inception, which means that they can frequently trade at a premium or discount to the fund\u2019s NAV. Investment trusts, which usually have more active management and use leverage, may have lower liquidity, affecting trading costs compared with more liquid ETFs. Choosing between ETFs and investment trusts requires a careful consideration of liquidity, the fund\u2019s use of leverage, tax efficiency, and whether the fund trades at a premium or discount. Before investing in either, be sure that it meets your long-term financial goals. It\u2019s always prudent to seek out advice from a financial advisor.

Financial products like ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) allow you to gain exposure to ether in a regulated market setting. This means knowing two things first: Ether is the cryptocurrency from the Ethereum network, a decentralized platform behind the launch of smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Second, futures for ether are contracts to trade the underlying at a price and time in the future set when the agreement is made. Spot markets for ether, which trade the underlying assets, were effectively approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May 2024, five months after spot bitcoin ETFs began trading. Thus, traders have two avenues within the regulated ETF space to speculate on ether's prices without buying the crypto tokens directly. Below, we explore Ethereum further and review how futures ETFs based on ether\u2019s price moves work. Ether is the name for the Ethereum blockchain's cryptocurrency. It's used for transaction fees and computational services on the Ethereum network. Ether owners can also contribute to helping secure the blockchain in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model. This method validates entries in a distributed database while securing the data. Ethereum launched in 2015 and helped introduce smart contracts, self-executing code that runs on the blockchain. This produced new ways to engage in DeFi, decentralized apps (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations. The Ethereum blockchain has the second highest market capitalization after Bitcoin. However, Ethereum is programmable, unlike Bitcoin, so that developers can build and deploy various dApps on top of the blockchain. Ether\u2019s price has been highly volatile, but it grew tremendously amid the increased adoption of DeFi and NFTs. The successful transition of Ethereum to a PoS system has been a key milestone for widening the network\u2019s reach. Its price has gone up significantly since spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in early 2024 and then again after spot ether ETFs were effectively approved in May 2024. Overall, Ethereum has been aiming to do more than provide a means for peer-to-peer payments. It has been trying to build a decentralized global computing infrastructure that expands the uses of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. Futures contracts are financial derivatives that allow investors to speculate on the prospective price moves of certain assets. They are legal agreements to buy or sell the asset at a preset price on a specific future date. Thus, they allow you to hedge risks or bet on the direction you believe an asset\u2019s price will move without owning it. They are commonly used for indexes, commodities like gold and oil, and now cryptocurrencies. Suppose you enter a three-month ether futures contract to buy ether at $1,500. This locks in the price you will pay in three months, no matter ether\u2019s market price at that time. If ether trades above $1,500 in three months, you profit by getting ether below market price. If it\u2019s below $1,500, you lose more money than if you bought ether on the spot market. Standard futures contracts have set expiration cycles, requiring investors to roll over their positions into new agreements. For futures, ETFs track their contract prices by spreading out the futures' various expiration dates. This provides continuous investment exposure without manually rolling over positions yourself. This also means that these ETFs hold futures contracts and do not directly hold the underlying assets they track\u2014in this case, ether. The contango effect in futures markets can negatively affect the long-term returns of futures-based ETFs like those tracking ether futures. Here\u2019s a brief explanation of it: Contango refers to a normal market condition where the futures price for an asset rises as the contract\u2019s expiration date moves further out. For example, one-month ether futures may trade at $1,500, while three-month ether futures trade at $1,600. When ether futures ETFs roll over their contracts as they near expiration, they have to sell the lower-priced short-term contracts and buy the more expensive long-term ones. This constant roll yield erodes the ETF\u2019s returns over time. This effect can grow, causing futures-based ETF returns to lag behind the spot prices they track. Contango is a major criticism of futures-based commodity ETFs and applies to ether and bitcoin futures ETFs. Skilled fund managers minimize this by optimizing roll timing, but contango\u2019s effects are hard to mitigate completely. It highlights the trade-offs of obtaining convenience through futures-based cryptocurrency ETF products. Ether futures ETFs hold a portfolio of ether futures contracts traded on exchanges rather than directly owning ether tokens. Authorized participants (APs), typically large broker-dealers, create shares of the ETF to be listed on a stock exchange. They purchase a basket of ether futures proportional to the ETF\u2019s desired holdings and contribute them to the fund in exchange for new ETF shares. The process also works in reverse, with the ETF redeeming shares from APs in exchange for a basket of underlying futures contracts. This creation/redemption mechanism helps minimize the difference between the ETF\u2019s share price and net asset value. For example, if ether futures rally, then the ETF share price on the secondary market will also rise. APs could then buy new ETF shares from the fund at net asset value in exchange for the right amount of ether futures. They can then sell the newly obtained ETF shares on the exchange at a higher market price for a profit. Market makers are also important in providing liquidity for the ETF shares. They stand ready to buy and sell ETF shares continuously to minimize large spreads between the bid and ask prices. This allows investors trading the ETF to enter and exit positions quickly. With APs and market makers, ether futures ETFs can offer traders convenient exposure to ether\u2019s futures prices through a fund that trades like stocks. Ether futures in the U.S. trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Each futures contract represents 50 units of the currency. Suppose an ether futures ETF, Ethereum Futures Fund (ETHF), is launched. The fund's sponsor partners with an AP, a large broker-dealer. The AP buys ether futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to deposit into the fund as its initial holdings. In return for contributing $10 million worth of ether futures, the AP receives 100,000 shares of ETHF at $100 per share from the fund sponsor to be listed on a stock exchange. Investors can then buy and sell shares of ETHF on the stock exchange through their brokers. The price will fluctuate depending on the market price of ether futures. If ETHF shares are trading on the exchange at $105, then an arbitrage opportunity exists for the AP. The AP can buy new ETHF shares from the fund at $100 net asset value and immediately sell them on the open market for $105, pocketing the spread of $5 per share. This helps keep the ETF share price in line with its holdings. If needed, the AP can redeem ETHF shares from the fund in exchange for a basket of ether futures. The ETHF fund managers repeatedly trade new futures contracts close to expiration, using capital from the ETF\u2019s assets to maintain exposure across the futures curve. The case for investing in ether futures ETFs largely rests on their accessibility and diversification potential. By providing exposure to ether and the broader cryptocurrency space within a regulated fund structure, ether futures ETFs allow a wider range of investors to participate. However, while the funds themselves fall under the purview of the CFTC and SEC, the crypto market does not. Easy and accessible way to gain ether exposure More regulated than direct ownership ETF structure may be more liquid than the underlying asset No need to understand the finer points of cryptocurrency ETH remains highly volatile. Differences between the ETF\u2019s share price and its underlying net asset value can emerge. The contango of the futures curve can erode long-term returns for futures-based ETFs as they roll over contracts. Unclear regulatory framework Potential cybersecurity risks Competition from spot ETH ETFs The familiar ETF wrapper makes adding a slice of crypto assets simple enough through regular brokerage accounts. This can offer more diversification for a portfolio and the potential for risk-adjusted returns. Active traders also gain liquidity for acting on ether futures price moves that direct futures contracts may lack. Under the right conditions, these benefits make ether futures ETFs appealing. However, ether futures ETFs' volatility and regulatory uncertainty are sizable risks. Ether\u2019s frequent and extreme price swings translate into highly volatile ETF values, suitable only for investors with a high risk tolerance. An unsettled regulatory environment for cryptocurrency ETFs, in general, could shift and reduce the value of these products. Additionally, threats like hacking, theft, and manipulation loom over any fund interfacing with the crypto ecosystem. Given the risky and complex nature of ether futures ETF investing, weighing the pros and cons is imperative. For most, minimal exposure combined with ample due diligence is advisable. Compared with bitcoin ETFs, ether futures ETFs have more exposure to the Ethereum ecosystem and, more broadly, the growth of decentralized finance rather than just cryptocurrency prices. However, bitcoins still represent much of the crypto market\u2019s capitalization. For those who want ETH exposure, investing in an ether futures ETF offers professional management and a certain degree of diversification, which is particularly appealing for individuals who lack the technical know-how or the time to manage crypto investments. Unlike directly holding ether, where investors need to manage their digital wallets and safeguard their private keys, an ether futures ETF is managed by financial professionals who navigate the complex world of cryptocurrency on behalf of the investors. This also allows you to speculate on future prices of ETH, unlike spot ether ETFs. These funds are traded on traditional stock exchanges, offering a more familiar interface to traditional investors than occasionally shady crypto exchanges. Moreover, compared with ETH futures contracts, an ether futures ETF provides a less complex exposure. Futures contracts require a good understanding of derivative markets, not to mention a readiness to meet margin calls during volatile market conditions. Meanwhile, an ether futures ETF brings these futures within a fund structure, mitigating the need for investors to negotiate the futures market themselves. This reduces the complexity and potential costs tied to managing margin requirements. In addition, an ether futures ETF provides a degree of diversification since it can hold futures contracts with various expiration dates or other related assets, spreading the risk. Diversification is particularly beneficial in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market. Finally, regulatory oversight of ETFs provides a layer of security and transparency that direct ether holdings or ETH futures contracts might not have. The appeal of ether as a digital asset is undeniable among certain investors, given its role in the burgeoning decentralized finance sector. However, ether is a relatively new and complex financial product with limited regulation and oversight. Thus, potential investors should assess the following before diving in: Investing in an ether futures ETF, as with any investment, requires meticulous research and a well-thought-out strategy. You should understand not only the mechanics of Ethereum and its performance on the market but also the management, fees, and performance of the ETF you are looking at. Moreover, consulting with a financial advisor well versed in cryptocurrencies and traditional finance is strongly advised. Several ether futures ETFs were introduced in 2023. For example, the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) seeks capital appreciation by investing in ether futures contracts, with around $30.1 million in assets under management (AUM) and an expense ratio of 0.66% as of April 2024. ProShares has the Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), with $72.5 million in AUM and an expense ratio of 0.95%. The Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) is another futures-based ETF with around $11.9 million under management and a 0.85% expense ratio. However, the future popularity of Ether futures ETFs remains uncertain. While a bitcoin futures ETF launched in late 2021 had about $1 billion in inflows within its first two trading days, newer Ether futures ETFs attracted only a few million dollars collectively during their first days. Since then, investors have had even more alternatives, like spot bitcoin and spot ETH ETFs, for crypto investing. Futures-based ETFs provide investors with indirect exposure to cryptocurrency price movements without directly owning or storing the underlying assets. However, futures-based ETFs may not perfectly track the cryptocurrency's spot price because of factors like rolling costs and contango. A spot ETH ETF, meanwhile, invests directly in the underlying cryptocurrency, providing investors with exposure to the spot price. Spot ETFs offer a more direct, accurate, and lower-cost way to invest in cryptocurrencies, eliminating the complexities and potential drawbacks of futures-based products. In addition, spot ETFs make it easier for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to ether through traditional brokerage accounts rather than relying on crypto exchanges and digital wallets. The SEC approved several spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, with spot ETH ETFs getting effective approval five months later. Spot ether ETFs began trading on U.S. exchanges in July 2024. In the U.S., the SEC has authority over regulating and approving ETFs and their marketing materials, while the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and individual exchanges may regulate ETF trading. Yes, major ether futures ETFs are structured to be compatible with standard brokerage retirement accounts, including individual retirement accounts. Yes, there are other cryptocurrency futures ETFs, with bitcoin futures ETFs being the most common. Some products hold bitcoins and ether, while others may have a broader range of cryptocurrencies. These ETF investors are exposed to the price moves of cryptocurrencies in a manner like ether futures ETFs but related to different cryptocurrencies. The availability of other cryptocurrency futures ETFs can offer diversification opportunities within the crypto asset class. Ether futures ETFs represent an intersection of cryptocurrency and traditional finance\u2014an accessible, regulated way to invest in ether, which is a digital asset. By tracking ether derivative contracts on major exchanges, these ETFs allow everyday investors to speculate on prices of the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s native cryptocurrency. However, there are inherent risks, from volatility to regulatory uncertainty. While providing access to a novel asset class, ether futures ETFs are complex instruments unsuitable for casual investors. Performing due diligence is prudent before any investing, and more so in this case. These funds merit consideration for strategic traders seeking efficient cryptocurrency exposure or diversification. As financial gateways to ether and decentralized networks, ether futures ETFs bear watching as fintech evolves. ethereum.org. \u201cWhat Is Ethereum?\u201d H.

            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol An ether futures exchange-traded fund is an investment tied to the expected price moves of ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. Ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hold derivative contracts but don't trade in ether (ETH) tokens directly. This allows investors more comfortable with regulated U.S. exchanges to engage in this market. Unlike spot cryptocurrency ETFs, which hold ETH directly, ether futures ETFs hold contracts tied to the crypto token's value and have shares that trade on regulated exchanges. A type of exchange-traded product, ether futures ETFs allow investors who don't have crypto wallets or are leery of unregulated crypto exchanges to speculate or hedge on ether's price moves. Futures are agreements to buy or sell ether at a specific price in the future, allowing the ETF to track ether\u2019s price indirectly. Spot ether ETFs, which hold crypto directly, were effectively approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May 2024, and they began trading on U.S. exchanges in July 2024. Investing in an ether futures ETF offers ease of access. You can buy and sell shares of the ETF on traditional stock exchanges, making it convenient if you\u2019re unfamiliar with cryptocurrency or the Ethereum blockchain. While the crypto exchange itself doesn't fall under the SEC's purview and thus is unregulated\u2014the SEC hasn't yet ruled that ether is a security\u2014the funds are. Nevertheless, ether futures ETFs have risks, such as the potential for price discrepancies (common to all ETFs tracking an asset), rapid price volatility (common to crypto), and potential issues with liquidity (common to more newly traded assets). As such, you need to conduct due diligence before buying shares in an ether futures ETF. ETFs buy securities that become their holdings. They then sell fractionalized shares on exchanges representing shares of their portfolios. In this case, they hold ether futures contracts, which are based on the expected price moves of the cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum blockchain. Ether futures are standardized agreements to buy or sell ether at a preset price on a future date and trade on regulated exchanges like the CME Globex. These ETFs roll over contracts as they expire to maintain their holdings in ether futures. Shares in them trade on regulated stock exchanges, making them accessible to retail and institutional investors. One important trait of ether futures ETF, common to all such funds, is the expense ratio. This is a fee charged by the ETF provider, which can be higher than the costs of directly buying and holding ether yourself. The Ethereum blockchain plays a crucial role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens. Its digital tokens serve several purposes within the ETH ecosystem, including enabling transactions and powering smart contracts. The network has transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS)consensus model, which means it uses far less energy than Bitcoin. While bitcoin miners must outcompete one another, \"validators\" on the ETH platform are randomly selected to confirm and validate transactions. This system randomizes who gets to collect fees rather than using a competitive rewards-based mechanism like proof-of-work. Though that might be better for the climate, it could make ether more like a security, in which case ETH would have to meet the same transparency and other regulations companies face when listing their shares. This was among the reasons ETH ETFs were held up in the U.S., not being effectively approved until May 2024, months after it approved the first 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs for the U.S. market. BlackRock (BLK) and Fidelity are among the major investment firms that applied and received approval from the SEC to create spot ether ETFs, which began trading in July 2024. The SEC was notoriously skittish in approving bitcoin ETFs\u2014a 2023 appeals court ruling seemed to force its hand\u2014having turned down many applications before 2024. Regulatory compliance Diversification Accessibility Lower operational risks Liquidity concerns Price volatility Higher expense ratios Investors should be aware of the pros and cons before buying shares in ether futures ETFs. Ether futures ETFs like the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) and the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) had a lackluster performance in the first month after they launched, but their values increased substantially once spot bitcoin ETFs were approved and the value of ETH spiked. In their first six months of trading after their October 2023 debuts, EFUT's value was up about 78%, while EETH's was up 105%. The SEC\u2019s willingness to approve ether futures ETFs could pave the way for more cryptocurrency-based financial products. The performance of ether futures ETFs is likely to be influenced by broader trends in the crypto market, including technological advances and regulatory changes. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual medium of exchange that deploys cryptography for security and operates independently of a centralized authority like a government or bank. Some uses for cryptocurrencies are for investments, in transactions, to facilitate smart contracts, and for DeFi. Whether ether should be classified as a security has been debated among regulators, legal experts, and the cryptocurrency community. The SEC hasn't yet labeled ETH a security, and its go-ahead for spot ETH ETFs in May 2024 makes that far less likely. Investors can buy ether directly on platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance. You can do so with bank transfers, credit cards, or other cryptocurrencies. You can also seek out decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap or SushiSwap for peer-to-peer trading. An ether futures ETF allows investors to gain exposure to ether without directly owning the cryptocurrency. These ETFs invest in ether futures contracts. Traded on traditional exchanges, these ETFs offer the ease of stock-like trading and are regulated, providing a layer of security for investors. Investing in ether cryptocurrency futures ETFs has benefits and risks. On the upside, these ETFs offer a more straightforward and regulated way to speculate on ether\u2019s price moves. They are also more efficient tax-wise. However, they also expose investors to risks such as ether\u2019s price swings and potentially low liquidity. Finally, since these ETFs use futures contracts to track ether prices, there might be discrepancies between the ETF share price and its value in ether.

            "content": "A comprehensive analysis of crypto ETFs and their potential blackCAT / Getty Images Whenever the prices of bitcoin and ether spike, investors not yet trading crypto want in on the action. However, many would like to avoid the complex or time-intensive world of digital wallets and crypto exchanges. To fill this demand, fund managers offer cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a more accessible way to invest in crypto's digital assets. Crypto ETFs allow you to gain exposure to these currencies through your regular brokerage account, eliminating the need to directly purchase and store the tokens yourself. These funds typically track the performance of one or more cryptocurrencies, providing investors with a convenient way to diversify their portfolios and benefit from the potential growth of this market. The first crypto futures funds launched in 2021; spot bitcoin ETFs joined them in early 2024 and spot ether (ETH) ETFs were effectively approved in May of the same year. Investing in crypto ETFs is not without risk. The market is volatile, with prices fluctuating significantly in short periods. In addition, the regulatory landscape for crypto is evolving, and changes in regulations will undoubtedly impact the performance and availability of these ETFs. As the cryptocurrency market matures and gains mainstream acceptance, crypto ETFs have a central role as investors want exposure to digital currencies. Below, we discuss the pros and cons of crypto ETFs, the different strategies each type of crypto aligns with, and their potential rewards and pitfalls. Crypto ETFs\u2014a type of exchange-traded product\u2014enable you to add crypto exposure to your investment portfolio. Like typical ETFs, they are traded on exchanges and held in traditional brokerage accounts. An ETF can provide exposure to cryptocurrencies in two ways. Spot ETFs trade crypto tokens directly on behalf of investors, buying bitcoins or other digital assets and storing them. Bitcoin ETFs were approved in early 2024, and spot ether ETFs were effectively approved in May of the same year. Crypto futures ETFs, the second kind, have gained traction as an alternative to directly investing in these digital assets. These funds track the expected price of one or more cryptocurrencies by trading futures, which are standardized agreements between two parties to exchange a specific quantity of assets on a particular day for a preset price. For instance, a bitcoin futures ETF uses futures contracts to mimic the fluctuations in the price of that currency. The futures contracts are combined in the ETF's portfolio, and the fund then offers shares to investors on stock exchanges. This allows investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market without buying and managing the digital assets themselves. However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has long hesitated to approve crypto ETFs, citing concerns that fund managers would be unable to protect investors from manipulation and fraud within the crypto markets. The cryptocurrency market is still largely unregulated, and the SEC has emphasized the need for robust safeguards to ensure fair and transparent trading practices. The regulator is also concerned that crypto-related investments could introduce speculative bubbles into the heart of the financial world while leading retail investors to believe that SEC approval means these currencies are safer than they are. Hence, the SEC was largely compelled to approve spot bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 after a federal appeals court ruling against them the previous year. Acceding on one front does not mean the SEC is standing down on others. After the bankruptcies of FTX, Voyager Digital, and other crypto platforms, the SEC moved to double the size of its crypto enforcement division. In the last several years, the SEC has taken over 140 actions against crypto-related firms, with several frauds worth billions. The SEC approved the first bitcoin spot ETFs for retail markets in January 2024. On their first day of trading, these 11 funds had a combined $4.6 billion of trading volume. The SEC's critics have long depicted the agency as overreaching in an area where innovation and the choice of individuals should trump other considerations. But SEC officials have suggested they never wanted to play such a role but were reluctantly drawn in. \"We have worked thoughtfully and incrementally in this space,\" SEC enforcement division director Gurbir Grewal said in June 2023. After initial investigations and civil actions, officials thought \"you'd also see compliance\" as in other industries facing a crackdown, \"but we're not seeing that in this space, so we had to change strategies.\" This brings us to where crypto stands in mid-2020s mainstream markets. The table below summarizes the main types of crypto ETFs available: futures-based ETFs, spot ETFs, inverse (short-selling) ETFs, leveraged ETFs, and blockchain ETFs. Each fund type is for specific kinds of strategies and has its own risk and reward profile. Crypto ETFs offer advantages to those interested in gaining exposure to cryptocurrency in their portfolio: The complexity of buying and holding crypto directly means that many investors either can\u2019t be bothered or won\u2019t have the technical knowledge required. Though crypto ETFs offer benefits, there are significant potential drawbacks: Provides easy exposure to crypto markets without having to learn about wallet setup or other complexities of blockchain technology. There is no need for the investor to hold cryptocurrency directly, meaning less exposure to hacking risk or loss. Professional fund management in a space that moves quickly and comes with many complexities. Fees tend to be higher than other ETFs. Investors do not own the cryptocurrency directly, and they must defer to the fund's management strategy. Unlike cryptocurrencies, ETFs can only be traded during market hours. Crypto markets on which the ETFs are based still largely unregulated. Investing in crypto ETFs and directly buying crypto provide exposure to cryptocurrency. However, there are many differences between the two. For many investors, the simplicity of using crypto ETFs will offset its drawbacks, such as higher fees and less control. It\u2019s a significant advantage to buy and sell crypto ETFs like any other fund and hold them in the same brokerage account as your other investments. However, crypto enthusiasts likely prefer to buy crypto directly. Many coins can be divided into tenths, hundredths, thousandths, or even more granularly, allowing direct investors to buy or sell precisely the amount of each coin they select. Direct investment also has lower costs and the ability to trade at all hours of the day. More convenient for most investors Higher fees Less control Too complicated or time-intensive for many investors Lower fees More control A critical concern for anyone interested in cryptocurrency is regulation. The regulatory environment for crypto has been changing rapidly, and these changes can affect the value of crypto or how funds pegged to their value are run. Another issue is that the legality of cryptocurrency in some jurisdictions is still not settled. Digital currencies are commonly used in criminal activity, such as smuggling or money laundering, and certain jurisdictions have taken steps to curtail or ban them outright. Major moves to ban crypto could cause a steep drop in value, even if it remains legal in your jurisdiction. When the SEC first approved spot bitcoin ETFs, it gave hope to backers of other cryptocurrencies for the same. Regulators soon began reviewing proposals from fund managers like VanEck, Greyscale, and Fidelity for spot ether ETFs, the digital currency native to the Ethereum platform. Those hopes were born out when spot ETH ETFs were effectively approved five months later. And they began trading on U.S. exchanges in July 2024. Ether is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, with over $400 billion worth of ETH circulating. This means it's of significant interest to both crypto enthusiasts and institutional investors. The major benefit of crypto ETFs is that you can invest in them in the same way as any other ETF. Once you know which ETF you\u2019d like to invest in, you can use your brokerage account to place an order to buy shares by searching for its ticker symbol. As of May 2024, the largest crypto ETF is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), which manages over $17.5 billion in bitcoin. The Internal Revenue Service considers crypto a digital asset, not currency, for tax purposes. This means crypto is taxed like any other investment. Thus, investing in crypto ETFs would likely involve similar tax obligations to investing directly in cryptocurrencies. However, it\u2019s always prudent to consult a tax advisor for advice on your particular tax situation, especially in the rapidly moving regulatory environment involving cryptocurrencies. Crypto ETFs allow institutional and everyday investors to speculate on the price of digital currencies. Nevertheless, it\u2019s essential to understand the differences between crypto ETFs and direct investment in crypto, such as higher fees and the lower amount of control you\u2019ll have over the digital assets. Before investing in crypto ETFs, it\u2019s important to note that crypto is a volatile asset class. Before plunging into these investment waters, getting professional advice is always prudent.

            "content": "The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is a digital currency investment product that makes bitcoins available to individual and institutional investors. Unlike a direct investment in bitcoin, which may require a deeper understanding of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency exchanges, GBTC offers a more traditional investment in the form of shares. The trust was originally launched in 2013 but was only available to institutional and accredited investors. On Jan. 21, 2020, GBTC became a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting company, registering its shares and making the trust the first digital currency investment vehicle to have this status. In January 2024, Grayscale was finally approved to operate GBTC as a spot bitcoin ETF, along with ten other funds.  Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) debuted in September 2013 as a private, open-ended trust for accredited investors. In 2015, it received FINRA approval to trade publicly, which meant that investors could buy and sell public shares of the trust under its ticker symbol, GBTC.\u00a0The trust is solely and passively invested in BTC, enabling investors to gain exposure to BTC as a security while avoiding the challenges of buying, storing, and securing the bitcoins directly. Shares are designed to track the BTC market price with fewer fees and expenses. GBTC was initially available only as a private placement until 2015, when it began trading publicly on the\u00a0OTCQX, an over-the-counter (OTC) market, under the alternative reporting standard for companies not required to register with the SEC.\u00a0At the time, GBTC was modeled on popular commodity investment products like the SPDR Gold Trust, a physically backed gold ETF. The company later added additional trusts to make investments in ether, litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies. Starting in 2017, Grayscale began seeking regulatory approval to operate GBTC as an exchange-traded fund that would be more accessible to retail investors. However, the SEC repeatedly rejected ETF applications, citing fears of market manipulation and investor risk. The regulator ultimately approved Grayscale's application for a bitcoin spot ETF in January 2024, along with ten other applications. GBTC was listed on the NYSE Arca as an ETF on Jan. 11, 2024. As an exchange-traded fund\u2014a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)\u2014GBTC shares can trade on both a primary and a secondary market. The primary market is available only to certain institutional investors. When an authorized partner wishes to invest, Grayscale buys bitcoins on the cryptocurrency market and issues an equivalent number of GBTC shares in exchange for capital. Those shares can then be sold on the stock market to retail investors. The trust holds a significant amount of actual bitcoins, and the price of its shares is meant to reflect the value of bitcoin held per share. However, GBTC shares have frequently traded at a large premium or discount to the actual value of the underlying bitcoin, known as its net asset value (NAV), something that appears to have changed since it converted to an ETF. One of the primary advantages of GBTC is its ability to provide simplified access to bitcoin, especially for individuals unfamiliar with the ins and outs of cryptocurrency trading and digital wallets. Unlike direct investments in bitcoin, which require a good understanding of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency exchanges, GBTC allows investors to trade shares in traditional brokerage accounts. This streamlined access can appeal to those seeking exposure to bitcoin's price movements without learning the intricacies of cryptocurrency transactions. GBTC is available for investors to buy and sell in the same way as virtually any ETF. GBTC can be traded through brokerage firms and is also available within tax-advantaged accounts like individual retirement accounts or 401(k)s. This presents a potential tax benefit for investors, allowing them to gain exposure to bitcoin in a tax-friendly manner, a significant advantage considering the capital gains tax implications of direct cryptocurrency investments\u200b. Another significant advantage of GBTC is its security. Storing cryptocurrency\u00a0safely is a notorious challenge, and Grayscale says its assets are safeguarded in line with the best industry standards. Investing in GBTC sidesteps the common security risks of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers. These platforms are frequently targets for hackers, and many investors have lost funds from security breaches. GBTC is known for its high management fees (1.5%) compared with other pooled investment vehicles. The fee structure could erode returns, especially in a bear market, making it a less cost-effective option for investors looking to gain exposure to bitcoin. The high fees are frequently cited as one of the main problems with GBTC when compared with other traditional investment vehicles or even other bitcoin ETFs. Available through brokerage accounts, IRAs, and 401(k)s Crypto assets held are protected by industry-leading security measures Is an SEC reporting company Can have large premiums or discounts to NAV Relatively high management fee Can be highly volatile Regulatory concerns about GBTC largely stem from the SEC's cautious approach toward cryptocurrency-based financial products. In 2021, GBTC filed an application with the SEC for full ETF approval. The application was held up at the SEC, along with similar applications by other prospective ETF providers. In 2023, a federal appeals court ruled that the SEC had improperly rejected Grayscale's application and had not clearly explained why GBTC should be treated differently from similar products. The regulator ultimately chose not to appeal the court's ruling, which required it to review its decision on GBTC. In January 2024, the SEC announced its approval of GBTC along with ten other exchange-traded funds. The trust's shares have traded at a discount to NAV for extended periods because of this regulatory uncertainty, with the discount reaching nearly 50% at one point. When the SEC approved the conversion of GBTC into a spot ETF, the discount to NAV diminished. On July 31, 2024, the discount had a five-year average of -8.09%, suggesting the fund was trading much more closely to its NAV. The regulatory maze surrounding GBTC's ETF conversion reflects broader concerns by regulators regarding investor protection, market manipulation, and the stability and maturity of the cryptocurrency market. The outcome of its ETF application set a significant precedent for how other cryptocurrency investments will be treated. GBTC offers a way to invest indirectly in bitcoin through an exchange-traded fund and gain exposure to bitcoin price movements. Owning bitcoins directly means you actually own the individual tokens. Generally, any retail investor can invest in GBTC as it is a publicly traded investment product. GBTC shares trade on the NYSE Arca exchange, along with other exchange-traded products, and can be bought through a brokerage account. Investing in GBTC has different tax implications compared with holding bitcoin directly. Typically, the trust structure may provide certain tax advantages or considerations that individual investors should review with a tax advisor. The taxation of cryptocurrency and crypto-related investments is complex, and the tax treatment of GBTC shares may vary based on individual circumstances and tax laws. The premium or discount to NAV in the GBTC mirrors the difference between the trust's market price for its shares and the value of the underlying bitcoin per share. A premium suggests that investors are willing to pay more for the exposure to bitcoin than the actual value of the bitcoin held and vice versa. A premium or discount indicates how the shares appeal to other investors. A premium might mean there is strong demand but also suggests that investors are paying more than the underlying asset's value. Alternatively, a discount could provide an opportunity to buy but could also be a negative sign about the market's view of the trust or bitcoin. Understanding these dynamics can help you make more informed decisions regarding potential investments in GBTC. GBTC provides a convenient way for investors to access bitcoin without direct ownership. It's available to individuals and institutions through brokerage accounts, IRAs, and 401(k)s. GBTC offers simplified bitcoin exposure but has downsides like high management fees and limited flexibility.

            "title": "How to Give an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) As a Gift",
            "content": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). MTStock Studio / Getty Images When you\u2019re buying gifts for the holiday season or another special occasion, you have no shortage of options. For one thing, e-commerce makes it easier than ever to have presents delivered from around the world. However, except for some collectibles, not many gifts have a chance of growing in value. If you\u2019re looking for a gift with longer-term financial benefits, you might choose to give someone an investment asset like an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Rather than representing a stake in a particular company like a stock or a specific debt instrument like a bond, an ETF is a pooled security, comprising a basket of different investments. When you give an ETF as a gift, this means that your recipient becomes an investor in the financial markets. With funds available that track almost any area of the market or type of asset, you can think of\u2014from broad stock indexes to niche segments, from commodities to bonds\u2014there are many ETFs that you could consider giving as a gift. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) represents a basket of various securities wrapped up into a single investment asset. Unlike mutual funds, which generally trade only at the end of the day, ETFs have the advantage of trading directly on stock exchanges, allowing investors to buy and sell shares by using their brokerage accounts in real-time throughout the trading day. This also allows ETF investors to carry out different types of transactions, such as stop orders and limit orders, providing more control over buying and selling prices. ETFs may offer tax advantages over other types of investments such as actively managed funds, where more frequent turnover in the fund may generate more capital gains taxes. Perhaps most importantly, ETFs offer the advantage of built-in diversification, with exposure to multiple securities offsetting the risk of another component which may decline in value. Since ETFs took off starting in the 1990s, they have become an increasingly important part of many investors\u2019 portfolios. With their capacity to target different parts of the market, ETFs allow investors to pursue many types of investment strategies. Given these benefits, perhaps it is no surprise that ETFs have seen massive growth throughout their decades on the market. As of August 2024, 3,378 ETFs were trading in the United States with assets of $9 trillion as of Q2 2024. With so many funds to choose from, selecting an ETF for your portfolio or deciding on the best one to give as a gift can be a bit overwhelming. Most ETFs are designed to track a specific index\u2014a group of securities designated to measure the performance of a particular area of the market. ETFs generally attempt to match the performance of their underlying index by investing in all of the assets on the index or holding a well-defined sample of the included securities. If you\u2019ve decided on an ETF as a suitable gift, selecting the best fund to give will depend on what type of investment you would like to pass on to the recipient. Here are some of the most popular types of ETFs: Gift giving used to involve searching for the right wrapping paper and greeting card before sending or delivering the item to its recipient. Of course, things are different if your gift is a financial asset\u2014particularly in the age of digital investing, with many online tools available for efficiently transferring ownership of securities. If you decide to give an ETF as a gift, you will have to determine the best way to get the asset into the hands\u2014or the investment account\u2014of your recipient. If you want to give an ETF as a gift, there are three primary methods you can use. Assuming that you are already an investor, your own broker or brokerage platform may be a good place to start if you want to give an ETF as a gift. In many cases, you can buy an ETF with your brokerage account and then fill out a form to request that your brokerage transfer the asset to the recipient. You will need to know some personal information about your recipient, likely including their full name, Social Security number, and address. If you are going to give shares of an ETF as a gift by transferring them from your brokerage account, the recipient will need to have their own brokerage account where they can hold the asset. This means that if you are giving ETF shares to somebody new to investing, they may need to open an account before they can receive their gift. Transferring ownership of the ETF shares may be even easier if the recipient has an account with the same broker or platform as the gift giver. Another way to gift an ETF is to sell the shares that you own and want to give and to put the proceeds in the recipient's account. You simply give them the cash that they need to buy shares in the ETF you want to gift. Giving a cash gift like this is likely one of the easiest ways to go, but there are a lot of considerations to keep in mind. For one, when you sell shares in an ETF, you'll trigger capital gains taxes if you sell the shares for a profit. You'll want to consider the cost basis of each share that you own and try to sell the shares that are most tax advantageous. Consider speaking to a financial professional to determine which shares to sell. Don't forget that you'll also have to consider gift taxes, which could come into play if you're gifting a large amount. If you'd rather avoid direct transfers or giving a cash gift, there are a variety of online gifting services that can help you give the gift of an ETF or another financial asset. With some of these services, it\u2019s as easy as typing in a dollar amount and the ticker of the ETF you want to give. However, your recipient may need to open an account with a brokerage platform associated with the gifting service to receive the gifted assets. You also may be able to give ETF shares as a gift directly through ETF issuers such as BlackRock and Vanguard. You will likely need to have your own account with the ETF issuer, and depending on the platform and account where you\u2019ll be transferring the shares to the recipient, there may be a varying amount of paperwork involved. Giving an ETF as a gift can be a great way to help a loved one get started on their investing journey or take a step forward in meeting their financial goals, but there are some drawbacks to ETFs that gift-givers should keep in mind. First and foremost, there\u2019s no guarantee that the investment performance of the fund you give as a gift will play out as expected. This makes it important to research the risks associated with the specific fund you\u2019re giving. Another concern is control. If you give ETF shares to someone else, they're free to do whatever they'd like with those shares, including selling them and using the cash for anything they'd like. Instead of starting them on their investing journey, you might just be handing over the equivalent of a cash gift to someone who will use it for some other purpose. If you want to give ETF shares as a gift, but don't want the recipient to have full control over the shares, you may consider forming a trust. A trust is a legal entity that can hold financial assets. The trustor places assets in the trust and then relies on another party, known as the trustee to manage those assets. The trust provides a financial benefit for a third party, the beneficiary. Trusts can be complicated, but the basic idea is that you can give away assets, such as ETFs, while not giving the recipient full control over them. Instead, you can set rules on how those assets are used. Given their complexity, if you are considering forming a trust, consult a financial advisor and attorney to determine the best path forward. When gifting shares of an ETF, the tax implications are another important thing to keep an eye on. For instance, if you make a gift that is worth more than a threshold defined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), you may be responsible for paying the gift tax. Fortunately, for the 2024 tax year, you would not be taxed on an ETF gift unless it was worth more than $18,000\u2014or $36,000 if gifted by a married couple\u2014and above the lifetime gift tax exemption, which is set at $13.61 million. For 2025, the gift tax exemption is $19,000 ($38,000 for a married couple) and the lifetime gift tax exemption is $13.99 million. The good news for you is that unless you sell your ETF shares to make a cash gift, there are unlikely to be any tax consequences. However, if you sell the shares before gifting, you may pay capital gains taxes or ordinary income depending on how long you had held the ETF shares before selling and the amount of increase from the time of purchase of the shares. Otherwise, the only thing to watch out for is the lifetime gift tax exemption. If you give a gift that is greater than the annual limit ($18,000 for 2024 and $19,000 for 2025) to a single person, any amount over that limit will reduce your lifetime gift tax exemption, which could lead to estate taxes in the future if you exhaust the exemption. The recipient of your gift will not have to pay taxes when they receive the gift as the donor is typically responsible for paying any gift taxes. However, they may owe taxes in the future. If things go as planned and your gift appreciates in value, your recipient will be responsible for paying capital gains taxes on their investment profit when they eventually sell the ETF shares. The amount of this tax liability will depend on how long the recipient held the asset, their tax bracket, and the amount that the ETF increased in value over the purchase price. Financial assets are some of the only types of gifts you can give that have the potential to increase in value. Also, giving a financial gift can be a great way to introduce younger people or those without investment experience to the importance and value of investing in the future. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in particular may be a suitable gift because they offer built-in diversification and the possibility to gain exposure to many different types of assets, targeting a broad or specialized slice of the financial markets. There are several avenues you can choose to give an ETF as a gift. You may be able to buy the shares using your own brokerage account and then transfer them to the recipient. You could also opt for an online gifting platform that facilitates the process of buying and gifting ETF shares. Finally, ETF issuers may allow you to gift shares of their products. In all cases, the recipient will need to have a brokerage account where they can hold the gifted shares. Like all investment assets, ETFs come with their own disadvantages and risks. Some downsides to ETF investing include the potential commissions and trading costs associated with buying and selling the shares, the possibility that the bid-ask spread of certain funds may limit your investment gains, and the chance that the fund\u2019s performance may diverge from the results of its underlying index because of a variety of factors. If you want to give a gift with the potential to make a lasting impact on the recipient\u2019s finances, ETFs may be worth adding to your shopping list. With the huge variety of ETFs on the market, you should be able to find a fund that can play a role in helping the recipient achieve any type of financial goal. You may be able to give ETF shares as a gift through your own brokerage, an online gifting service, or directly from the ETF issuer.

Nikada / Getty Images Single-stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a new exchange-traded product allowing for leveraged or inverse trading of a single stock. They are intended to give ordinary investors a wider range of tools for navigating volatile markets by making it easy to go short on single stocks without having to sell them short. However, because of the way in which they are constructed and their use of leverage, regulators are warning that single-stock ETFs carry greater risk than ordinary ETFs and may be unsuitable for long-term investors. Single-stock ETFs featuring leverage first appeared on European markets in 2018. Financial firm AXS Investments launched eight such products for the first time in the United States in 2022, allowing investors there to trade them. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are single securities that can hold a portfolio of stocks. Indeed, the first ETFs were created to track broad-based indexes such as the S&P 500 or the Russell 2000. ETFs can also hold derivatives such as futures and options contracts in addition to, or instead of, shares of stock. This allowed for the advent of leveraged ETFs, which provide a multiple of the return of the underlying index or benchmark. For example, a leveraged ETF could provide two or three times the daily returns of the S&P 500 index. It also allowed for inverse ETFs (and inverse-leveraged ETFs), which provide negative returns (for example, -1 time or -2 times the return of the index). Single-stock ETFs do not hold a portfolio of stocks; rather, they track just a single stock but employ derivatives contracts to provide leveraged and/or inverse returns.\u00a0Leverage is a double-edged sword, meaning that it can lead to significant gains but also lead to significant losses. Investors should be aware of the risks of leveraged ETFs because the risk of losses is far higher than with traditional investments. For example, a 1.5\u00d7 leveraged bull single-stock ETF would likely own short-dated call options that provide a net delta of +150. A 2\u00d7 bear single-stock ETF would instead hold put options in an amount resulting in a delta of -200. Because of how leveraged and inverse ETFs (including single-stock ETFs) are constructed, they tend to have a negative roll to maintain the proper derivatives position geared at returning a multiple of daily performance. This means that they naturally exhibit time decay and will tend to lose value over medium and long holding periods, regardless of the performance of the underlying assets. As a result, these products are intended only for day trading or very short-term holding periods. Single-stock ETFs also may be prone to quickly lose value in volatile markets. An interview posted July 15, 2022, on Yahoo! Finance illustrates this point. Yahoo! Finance anchor Jared Blikre said, \u201cIf we take a hypothetical stock and it\u2019s three times leveraged ETF, and we just kind of chop around with some volatile action. Let\u2019s say they both begin at $100. And then let\u2019s say we have a 20% up day followed by two 10% down days, a 20% up, a negative 20%, a negative 10%, another [negative] 20%. At the end of the day, guess what, the stock is worth $100.78, basically flat. Guess what, the ETF lost 40% of its value.\u201d The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), as well as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which oversees securities markets and dealers, have both warned that current regulations may not be adequate to oversee single-stock ETFs, and that these may be inappropriate for most individual investors, presenting unusually high risk. Single-stock ETFs first appeared on European markets in 2018, and entered the U.S. market in the summer of 2022. In July 2022, AXS Investments, a New York-based asset manager, listed eight such products giving leveraged investments on Telsa, Nvidia, PayPal, Nike, and Pfizer: However, these investments struggled to gain interest, and six of them were removed from the market within a year of their launch. In mid-2023, Direxion launched 12 single-stock ETFs, offering leveraged bets on tech companies like Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Nvidia. Rex Shares followed suit with single-stock ETFs for Tesla and Nvidia. TSLQ is the ticker symbol for the AXS TSLA Bear Daily ETF. It seeks to return -1\u00d7 the daily performance of Tesla (TSLA) shares. In other words, if TSLA drops 5% over the course of a trading day, the TSLQ Bear ETF should gain 5% on the same day. However, due to management expenses and other costs, the fund will return slightly lower profits over time. Let\u2019s see how the two securities performed on Nov. 27, 2023. As shown in the chart below, comparing the two, TSLQ provides a close mirror image to the intraday returns of TSLA. Note, however, that the daily returns were not identically inverse: TSLA gained 1.08% at the close of that day, while the single-stock ETF TSLQ lost 1.03%. While this difference may be small for a single day, the tracking error between the two could compound over time, especially if the price swings up and down repeatedly. Single-stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been labeled as extremely risky by regulators and market commentators. Nonetheless, in 2022, the United States listed them for the first time. However, single-stock ETFs appear to fall under Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\u00a0In combination with recent changes to the listing standards at stock exchanges, that rule created a framework that allows ETFs meeting certain criteria to come directly to market without first obtaining explicit permission, through what is called an exemptive order from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). No. Single-stock ETFs are exchange-traded securities that use derivatives contracts (options) on individual stocks to provide leveraged returns. The ETF itself is a security. Single-stock futures (SSFs) are not securities but instead are futures contracts, with an individual stock as the underlying security. Each contract typically controls 100 shares of stock. While the reception for single-stock futures was positive when they launched in the U.S., activity has faded over time. Single-stock ETFs are intended for very short holding periods, such as intraday, and are not meant to be held as longer-term investments. The SEC states that, \u201c[b]ecause of the features of these products and their associated risks, it would likely be challenging for an investment professional to recommend such a product to a retail investor while also honoring his or her fiduciary obligations or obligations under Regulation Best Interest. However, retail investors can and do access leveraged and inverse exchange-traded products through self-directed trading.\u201d A single-stock ETF is an investment fund that uses derivatives to bet on or against a single stock. These instruments can deliver high returns, but they are also considered extremely risky for retail investors.

            "title": "What Are Custom Basket ETFs?",
            "content": "Investopedia / Julie Bang Exchange-traded funds are baskets of stocks or bonds, usually passively managed, and seek to match an underlying benchmark index. Custom basket exchange-traded funds (ETFs) take advantage of the ETF Rule passed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2019. The rule permits ETF managers to customize asset purchases outside their target index or allocation constraints when it benefits the ETF and shareholders. It also gives ETF managers additional flexibility when buying and selling stock and other assets for their funds. When investors buy or sell shares of an index fund ETF, they may buy or sell existing shares from someone else. However, the fund has to issue new shares or eliminate shares in some cases. At the same time, the fund must buy or sell underlying assets that make up the index to keep it accurately weighted. Before the ETF rule, funds were required to buy and sell asset baskets in precisely the same proportion as required by the fund. The fund would buy a basket of shares in the fund\u2019s accounts as shares were issued and sell a basket of shares when redeemed. While this process worked, it did not consider market fluctuations or taxation. Custom basket ETFs customize buying and selling strategies to optimize shareholder profits. Custom baskets give fund managers some control over which shares they buy and sell, as well as the timing\u2014even if that means going slightly out of alignment with the underlying index or target allocation. In Jan. 2024, the SEC approved\u00a0eleven\u00a0spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications, making investing in the cryptocurrency more accessible. When used effectively, custom basket ETFs can benefit fund managers and investors. An improved trading strategy may improve tax efficiency, lower trading costs, and help the fund take advantage of opportunities to buy or sell at a more favorable price. A fund manager\u2019s custom basket strategy can make a difference in fund performance. For example, when comparing several S&P 500 funds, investors may see a slight difference in results across fund managers. However, this also means the fund may not follow the index or allocation model. If the fund manager employs custom baskets ineffectively, it could cost shareholders instead of rewarding them. A custom basket allows trading outside the target alignment of a fund\u2019s index or target asset allocation. By contrast, a standard basket is a basket in exact alignment with the target. Individual investors can\u2019t easily create a custom exchange-traded fund (ETF). Creating an ETF and ETF shares requires access to complex systems and compliance with government regulations. Investors think of an ETF as a basket of stocks. However, an ETF may include additional asset classes, such as bonds or commodities. The \u201cETF Rule,\" adopted by the\u00a0SEC\u00a0in 2019, allowed for custom basket ETFs.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. The S&P 500 Index has long been one of the best-known proxies for the U.S. stock market, and several mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that passively track the index have become popular investment vehicles. These funds do not seek to outperform the index through active trading, stock picking, or market timing; instead, relying on the inherent diversification of the broad index to generate returns. Indeed, over long-term horizons, the index typically produces better returns than actively managed portfolios, especially after taking into account taxes and fees. So, what if you had just held the S&P 500, using an index fund or some other means of holding the stocks in it? People often use the S&P 500 as a yardstick for investing success. Active traders or stock-picking investors are often judged against this benchmark in hindsight to evaluate their savvy. Let's take a historical example: Soon after Donald Trump entered the race for the Republican nomination for president, the press zeroed in on his net worth. As of 2024, financial experts have pegged his net worth at $7.5 billion. One of the cornerstones of Trump's campaign was his success as a businessperson and his ability to create such wealth. However, financial experts pointed out that if Trump liquidated his real estate holdings, which were estimated to be worth $500 million, back in 1987, and invested them in the S&P\u00a0500 Index, his net worth would be as much as $13 billion in 2015. It is just one more example of how the S&P 500 Index continues to be held up as the standard by which all investment performances are measured. Investment managers are paid a lot of money to generate returns for their portfolios that beat the S&P\u00a0500, yet on average, most don't. This is the reason why an increasing number of investors are turning to index funds and ETFs that simply try to match the performance of this index. If Trump had done so back in 1987, he would have made 26 times his money for an average annualized return of 12.3% by the time he was inaugurated (from 1987 to 2015\u2014the date of calculation for projected net worth). But hindsight is 20/20, and he could not have known that. If you had invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 on the first trading day of January 2001, it would have been worth around $55,331 by the end of 2023. Because past performance is no indication of future performance, no one can say whether the stock market will perform the same way in the next 20 years. However, you can use past performance to create some hypothetical scenarios that allow you to consider possible outcomes. To do that, look at the 20-year performance of the S&P 500 at various intervals as an indication of how it might perform under similar circumstances in the future. One of the biggest reasons why it is impossible to predict stock market returns over a long period of time is because of the existence of black swans. Black swans are catastrophic, unexpected events that can alter the course of the markets in an instant and whose impact may be felt for years to come. Such events are called black swans because they appear so rarely, but they appear often enough that they have to be accounted for when looking into the future. The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, were a black swan event that impacted the economy and the markets for years. Other examples of black swan events are the global financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic that erupted worldwide in March 2020. You also have to consider the market cycles that can occur within a 20-year span. For example, in the 20-year span from 2001 to 2020, the S&P 500 had three distinct bull markets and three bear markets. Research from Invesco shows that from the period of November 1968 through December 2020\u2014a span of more than 50 years\u2014the average length of a bull market was 1,764 days (or approximately 58 months), while the average bear market lasted 349 days (11.5 months). Over this period, the average gain in a bull market was +180.04%, while the average loss in a bear market was -36.34%. A bull market is generally characterized by a market rise of at least 20% from its previous low. A bear market is defined by a market decline of at least 20% from its prior high. The most recent 20-year span, from 2001 to 2021, not only included three bull markets and three bear markets, but it also experienced a number of major black swans with the tech wreck and terrorist attacks in 2001, the financial crisis in 2008, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these unprecedented events, the S&P 500 still managed to generate a total annual return of 8.06% with reinvested dividends. The total return over this period was 409.13%, which means that a $10,000 investment made at the beginning of 2001 would have been $50,913.05 by the end of 2021. Taking a different 20-year span that also included three bull markets but only one bear market, the outcome is quite different. In the period from 1987 to 2006, the market suffered a steep crash in October 1987, followed by another severe crash in 2001 to 2002, but it still managed to return an average of 11.24% with dividends reinvested, which is an 8.10% inflation-adjusted return. The total return of $10,000 invested in January 1987 would have been $84,227.27. Likewise, the market roared back following the 2007-2008 financial crisis to the longest bull run on record. You could repeat that exercise over and over to try to find a hypothetical scenario you expect to play out over the next 20 years, or you could simply apply the broader assumption of an average annual return since the stock market\u2019s inception, which is 6.86% on an inflation-adjusted basis. With that, you could expect your $10,000 investment to grow to $34,000 in 20 years. The S&P 500 is one of the most widely followed proxies for the U.S. stock market. It's a bellwether and benchmark for many major funds and portfolio managers. From 1950 to 2023, the S&P 500 yielded an annualized average return of 11.34%. A cost-effective way to invest in the S&P 500 is through an exchange-traded fund like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which has an expense ratio of 0.0945%. Generally, yes. The S&P 500 is considered well-diversified by sector, which means it includes stocks in all major areas, including technology and consumer discretionary\u2014meaning declines in some sectors may be offset by gains in other sectors. You may not be able to predict the performance of the S&P 500 Index for the next 20 years, but you are not alone. In one of his annual letters to shareholders, Warren Buffett included an excerpt from his will that ordered his children\u2019s inheritance to be placed in an S&P 500 Index fund because the \u201clong-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors\u2014whether pension funds, institutions, or individuals who employ high-fee managers.\u201d Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors.

            "content": "We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Svetikd / Getty Images Individuals can invest in the S&P 500 through index funds or ETFs that follow the index. Investors can choose a taxable brokerage account, a 401(k), or an IRA. The S&P 500 index tracks the largest companies in the United States based on factors like market capitalization, sector allocation, and liquidity. The S&P 500 Index was launched in 1957 as the first U.S. market-cap-weighted equity index and is considered the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities.  The index includes 500 leading U.S. companies, although that number may fluctuate. The S&P 500 represents approximately 80% of available U.S. market capitalization. As of May 2024, 503 constituents comprise the S&P 500, with an estimated $43.4 trillion total market capitalization. S&P 500 stocks reflect the U.S. economy's growth drivers. As of Apr. 30, 2024, the top 10 constituents of the S&P 500 by index weight include: Three sectors hold the largest concentration of companies in the S&P 500 in April 2024: Information Technology 29.2%, Financials 13.1 %, and Healthcare 12.3%. Index investing allows individuals to effectively follow the market activity of up to 500 companies with the S&P 500. An index fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that benchmarks to the S&P 500 allows investors to gain exposure to all those stocks. ETFs focus on passive index replication, giving investors access to every security within a particular index. Index ETFs are generally low-cost and trade throughout the day just like stocks. Consequently, they are highly liquid and subject to intraday price fluctuations.Nearly all major brokerages and fund companies offer some type of S&P 500 fund, such as the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (IVE), the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF (SPY), and the Vanguard S&P 500 Value ETF (VOO). S&P 500 index funds tend to have slightly higher fees than ETFs because of higher operating expenses. Because a mutual fund has a structure that differs from an ETF, investors can only buy it at the day\u2019s closing price, based on the fund's net asset value (NAV).Index investing pioneer Vanguard's S&P 500 Index Fund (VFINX) was the first index mutual fund for individual investors. The Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFIAX) is one of the largest index funds. An index is a measure of the performance of its constituent securities. Individuals invest in an index through ETFs and index funds that try to replicate the performance of specific indexes. To invest in S&P 500 ETFs, investors can gain exposure through discount brokers with commission-free trading. S&P 500 index funds trade through brokers and discount brokers and may be accessed directly from the fund companies. Investors may also access ETFs and mutual funds through employer 401(k) programs, individual retirement accounts (IRA), or roboadvisor platforms. The expense ratio for ETFs is the overall annual cost paid to the fund manager by investors. Many mutual funds include loads or commissions paid to the fund managers. These may be classified as front-end or back-end loads. Investors can review the performance by accessing the fact sheet for every investment on the company's website that offers the ETF or the mutual fund. Using the name and ticker symbol of the funds, investors can then determine the amount of capital they have to invest.

Read our\u00a0advertiser disclosure\u00a0for more info. Investors may choose an advanced approach to S&P 500 fund investing and consider smart beta indexes. These options have lower costs and offer the advantage of fundamental or customized investing. Examples of such funds include the AAM S&P 500 High Dividend Fund (SPDV) and the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index Fund (RSP). Investors can also target index segments that offer capital appreciation potential, with funds like the SPDR sector series or dividend-focused funds.Bullish leveraged funds use leverage to multiply the return of the S&P 500 when it performs well. Bearish leveraged funds short the S&P 500 to pull in positive returns when the index falls. The difference in fees between S&P 500 index funds and ETFs these days is marginal. For example, some of the biggest and most popular S&P 500 ETFs have a very low\u00a0expense ratio. Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF (VOO) has an expense ratio of 0.03%, while the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFIAX) has an expense ratio of 0.04%. S&P 500 index ETFs and mutual funds pay dividends to the constituent companies. The S&P 500 index has a dividend yield of about 1.47% as of Apr. 2024. For a company to be in the S&P 500, it must be a U.S. company, it should have an unadjusted market cap of at least $12.7 billion and a float-adjusted market cap of at least 50% of that minimum threshold, and it must have positive as-reported earnings over the most recent quarter as well as over the four most recent quarters combined.  Investing in an S&P 500 index fund is a way to diversify an investor's portfolio. An ETF or a mutual fund allows investors to gain exposure to a variety of stocks included in the index such as Apple, Microsoft, or Walmart.

            "content": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications. Vanguard has a fairly unique structure for an investment management company. The company is owned by its funds; the funds are owned by the shareholders. This means that its shareholders are the actual owners. Unlike most publicly-owned investment firms, Vanguard has no outside investors other than its shareholders. Vanguard's structure allows the company to charge very low expenses for its funds. The average expense ratio for Vanguard funds was 0.09% at the end of 2023, significantly lower than the industry average of 0.50%. As of March 31, 2024, Vanguard has $9.3\u00a0trillion in assets under management (AUM), making it second only to BlackRock, which boasts $10.5 trillion in AUM.\u00a0Headquartered in Pennsylvania, Vanguard is the largest mutual funds issuer in the world and the second-largest issuer of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As of July 2024, Vanguard has 208 U.S. funds and 215 international funds available. The firm boasts more than 50 million investors. It also has one of the largest bond funds\u00a0in the world, the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBTLX). Within the industry, Vanguard is a leader in offering passively managed mutual funds and ETFs.\u00a0 It is known for its: Some experts believe Vanguard\u2019s structure allows it to avoid conflicts of interest present at other investment management firms. Publicly traded investment management firms must cater to both their shareholders and the investors in their funds. Vanguard does not have outside shareholders, so it can prioritize the needs of investors. John C. Bogle began working for the Wellington Management Company in 1951. Through his years at the company, he held various positions before becoming an executive and eventually president. Following a dispute with a merged company in 1974, Bogle formed a new company called The Vanguard Group of Investment Companies. He named the new company Vanguard after a British ship because he admired the leadership theme it embodied. Bogle created the First Index Investment Trust in 1976, now known as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFIAX). Although the fund's growth was initially slow, it took off. By the 1980s, other mutual funds began copying his index investing style. Bogle created Vanguard and molded it into a place where retail and individual investors could turn to build wealth without needing the services of a broker and the expenses charged by them. His vision was low-cost investing and transparency for non-institutional investors. Vanguard now has some of the largest index funds in the business. It offers funds aimed at achieving a variety of investment goals, including: Like any other investment strategy, investing in index funds comes with both pros and cons. All investing involves risk; knowing what risks are associated with index funds can help you decide if they are the right investment choice for you. Lower fees Easy for new investors Less expensive Diversity Beat actively-managed funds Limited returns Lack of reactive ability Risk for short-term investors Limits personal strategies Lower fees: Index funds can charge lower fees because, with few exceptions, they track an index that is only changed if a stock listed on the index no longer meets the criteria for being listed. This means index funds are passively managed and don't need as much attention as those that don't track indexes. Easy for new investors: New investors with limited capital, knowledge, and time, benefit from index funds because there is no need to analyze stocks to find ones that suit them. Stocks on indexes have already gone through rigorous evaluation and weighting. Investors can easily read through the prospectus and reports and find funds that fit their interests and goals. Less expensive: Index investing is less expensive than many other investment options. Apart from fees, index funds have much less turnover than actively managed funds. This keeps the investors from having several taxable events and racking up capital gains without cashing in their stocks. Diversity: These funds can provide diversity that funds full of hand-picked stocks may not. Index funds let you hold stocks from hundreds of companies rather than focusing on a few from one industry or company. Beat actively-managed funds: Passively managed funds beat those that are actively managed because of the associated fees and additional costs. Short-term returns may not always be higher with index funds, but active fund managers fail to beat benchmark indexes most of the time. For example, just over half of active funds underperformed the S&P 500 over a one-year period. That number jumps up to over 91% over 10 years. Limited returns: The returns for an index fund are limited to those of the underlying index because index funds attempt to mimic the returns of their benchmark. Lack of reactive ability: Because you're investing in a fund that mirrors an index, you cannot act on undervalued or overvalued stocks within the fund. Risk for short-term investors: Short-term investors are exposed to downside risk with index funds. Investors who don't invest in index funds for the long term might see decreased returns or even losses. Most index funds are best for long-term buy-and-hold strategies. Limits personal strategies: Index fund investing tends to limit the investment strategies you're exposed to. Your strategies are limited to that of the fund and index managers unless you have included the index fund as part of your overall strategy. According to the Vanguard Group, the company is owned by its member funds, which are owned by the fund shareholders. Thus, the fund shareholders are the owners of Vanguard. Vanguard is owned by its member funds, which are owned by fund shareholders. Therefore, someone who has purchased shares of a Vanguard fund is a Vanguard owner. Vanguard does not have outside shareholders. Vanguard's owners are its funds' shareholders. If a fund holds shares of a company, then that fund and the fund's shareholders are owners of the company whose share is held. So, Vanguard doesn't own any companies; the fund's shareholders do. Index funds are a practical investing strategy for many investors. Mutual funds and ETFs that track indexes have very low costs. They must ensure that their holdings generally reflect and track the index's performance. This results in lower fees for investors; in Vanguard's case, it also gives them ownership of the company helping them invest. The stocks listed on broad indexes such as the S&P 500 are chosen by skilled investment professionals. This means that index fund investors are receiving and benefitting from professional investment advice by passively tracking indexes without even talking to an advisor.

            "content": "Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Gambling is a thriving market in the United States and can be invested in like any other industry. If you're an investor interested in putting some of your money into the gambling industry, consider an exchange-traded fund (ETF). As booming as the gambling industry is, though, there aren't very many investment choices. In fact, there are only two ETFs that focus specifically on gambling in the U.S., excluding inverse and leveraged funds as well as those with under $50 million in assets under management (AUM). Though there is no benchmark for the gambling industry, the performance of these funds can be compared against the broader market. In this article, we look at both of these options. All numbers below are as of September 27, 2023. In order to focus on their investment strategies, the top holdings listed for each ETF exclude cash holdings and holdings purchased with securities lending proceeds except under unusual cases, such as when the cash portion is exceptionally large. Before we dive into the two ETFs, let's take a look at the gambling industry itself. This industry includes traditional casino gaming, sports betting, and iGaming in the United States. Combined revenue for the industry was over $60 billion in 2022, even higher than the industry's previous record-shattering revenue of $53 billion in 2021. Sports Betting and iGaming in particular have grown at a tremendous pace since 2019. This growth was driven by the increase in legalized online sports betting and an accelerated shift toward online entertainment trends during the pandemic. The online gaming market alone is expected to reach $172 billion by 2030. As noted above, investors who want to capitalize on the growth of casino and gambling companies may consider the following ETFs, which provide access to a basket of stocks, diversity, and minimization of risk. In 2018, the Supreme Court gave U.S. states permission to legalize sports betting if they wish to do so. The practice now is fully legal and active in 35 states plus the District of Columbia. It has been legalized in three other states but is not yet active. Sports betting remains fully illegal in 12 states, including Georgia, California, and Texas. The VanEck Gaming ETF (BJK) aims to track the MVIS Global Gaming Index, which is designed to gauge the performance of companies involved in casinos and casino hotels, sports betting, lottery services, gaming services, gaming technology, and gaming equipment. Companies included in the index must derive at least half of their revenue from the global gaming industry. Close to half (48.34%) of the ETF's holdings are based in the U.S., with the remaining holdings based in other countries throughout the world. About 85% of the fund is allocated to companies operating within the consumer discretionary sector. The fund follows a blended strategy of investing in a mix of growth and value stocks across the market cap spectrum. The top three holdings of BJK include: If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, call the National Problem Gambling Helpline at 1-800-522-4700, or visit NCPGambling.org/Chat to chat with a helpline specialist. Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF (BETZ) tracks the Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming Index, which is designed to gauge the performance of the sports betting and iGaming industry. The ETF provides exposure to companies involved in sports books and in-person and online gambling as well as companies providing infrastructure or technology to such companies. The fund is geographically diversified across a number of countries, though U.S.-based companies receive the largest allocation at nearly a third of the portfolio. It follows a blended strategy, investing in a mix of value and growth stocks of various market caps. The fund\u2019s top three holdings are: Companies that are part of the gambling industry are those that allow consumers to wager money on an event with an uncertain outcome in the hope of winning a profit. This can include casinos, sports betting, iGaming, lotteries, and other kinds of betting and wagering. Gambling is a highly profitable industry, The American Gaming Association reported record profits of over $60 billion in 2022. However, the nature of the gambling industry also means it is highly uncertain and variable. Changes in federal and state gambling laws can increase or decrease access to gaming, and therefore affect profits. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) allows you to invest in many assets at once. Assets in an ETF are selected by professional investment managers, which means you don't have to individually research and select single stocks. This can make it easier to diversify your portfolio and lower your investment costs. Like any other sector of the economy, there are opportunities to invest in the gambling industry. Gambling is a booming industry in the United States. One of the best ways to do this is to invest in gambling exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The two gambling ETF available to investors in the U.S. are BJK and BETZ. BJK, which tracks the MVIS Global Gaming Index, is offered by VanEck. BETZ is offered by Roundhill Investments. It tracks the Roundhill Sports Betting and iGaming Index. Both funds have holdings of U.S. and international companies involved in sports betting, casino gaming, iGaming, and other kinds of gambling.

Active investing strategies require expensive portfolio management teams that try to beat stock market returns and take advantage of short-term price fluctuations. Of note, passive strategies that involve ETFs and index mutual funds have grown dramatically in popularity versus active strategies. That's not only due to the cost benefits of lower management fees, but also to higher returns on investment. Index investing has been the most common form of passive investing since 1976, when Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard, created the first index mutual fund. The market for ETFs (the second most popular form of passive investing) has grown significantly since they were first launched in the 1990s as a way to allow investment firms to create \u201cbaskets\u201d of major stocks aligned to a specific index or sector. Both ETFs and index mutual funds are pooled investment vehicles that are passively managed. The key difference between them (discussed below) is that ETFs can be bought and sold on the stock exchange (just like individual stocks)\u2014and index mutual funds cannot. The investing strategy behind an index fund\u2014whether ETF or mutual fund\u2014is that a portfolio that matches the composition of a certain index (without variation) will also match the performance of that index. Moreover, the overall market will outperform any single investment over the long term. In particular, an ETF is comprised of a portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities of a particular index and tracks the returns of that index. For example, ETFs can be structured to track a particular broad market index or a sector, an individual commodity or a diverse collection of securities, a specific investment strategy, or even another fund. An ETF offers investors major diversification by providing exposure to a wide range of assets. Unlike index mutual funds, ETFs are flexible investment vehicles that are highly liquid. They can be bought and sold on a stock exchange throughout the trading day, just like individual stocks. Because investors can enter or exit an ETF position whenever the market is open, ETFs are attractive to a broad range of the investing public, including active traders (like hedge funds) as well as passive investors (like institutional investors). Another reason why ETFs attract passive and active investors is that certain ETFs include derivatives\u2014a financial instrument whose price is derived from the price of an underlying asset. The most common ETFs that invest in derivatives are those that hold futures\u2014agreements between buyer and seller to trade certain assets at a predetermined price on a predetermined future date. Other such ETFs may invest in options. Another benefit of ETFs is that\u2014because they can be traded like stocks\u2014it is possible to invest in them with a basic brokerage account. There is no need to create a special account, and they can be purchased in small batches without special documentation or rollover costs. Investment research firms report that few (if any) active funds perform better than passive funds over the long term. In addition, compared to actively managed funds, passive ETFs and index mutual funds are low-cost investment options. Similar to an ETF, an index mutual fund is designed to track the components of a financial market index. Index mutual funds must follow their benchmarks passively, without reacting to market conditions. Orders to buy or sell them can be executed only once a day after the market closes. An index mutual fund can track any financial market, such as: For example, an index mutual fund tracking the DJIA invests in the same 30 companies that comprise that index\u2014and the fund portfolio changes only if the DJIA changes its composition. If an index mutual fund is following a price-weighted index\u2014an index in which the stocks are weighted in proportion to their price per share\u2014the fund manager will periodically rebalance the securities to reflect their weight in the benchmark. Although they are less flexible than ETFs, index mutual funds can deliver the same strong returns over the long term. Another benefit of index mutual funds that makes them ideal for many buy-and-hold investors is their ease of access. For example, index mutual funds can be purchased through an investor\u2019s bank or directly from the fund. There's no need for a brokerage account. This accessibility has been a key driver of their popularity. Certain features of each type of fund (described above) result in index mutual funds being less liquid than ETFs and lacking ETFs' intraday trading flexibility. In addition, different factors related to index tracking and trading give ETFs a cost and potential tax advantage over index mutual funds: In 2023, ETFs attracted $598 billion in assets while mutual funds saw $440 billion in outflows. In 2021, they attracted close to a $1 trillion. The benefits and drawbacks of ETFs versus index mutual funds have been debated in the investment industry for decades, but\u2014as always with investment products\u2014the choice of one over the other depends on the investor. Typically, it comes down to preferences related to management fees, shareholder transaction costs, taxation, and other qualitative differences. Despite the lower expense ratios and tax advantages of ETFs, many retail investors (non-professional, individual investors) prefer index mutual funds. They like their simplicity and their shareholder services (such as phone support and check writing) as well as investment options that facilitate automatic contributions. While increased awareness of ETFs by retail investors and their financial advisers has grown significantly, the primary drivers of demand have been institutional investors seeking ETFs as convenient vehicles for participating in (or hedging against) broad movements in the market. The convenience, ease, and flexibility of ETFs allow for the superior liquidity management, transition management (from one manager to another), and tactical portfolio adjustments that are cited as the top reasons institutional investors use ETFs. The biggest difference is that ETFs can be bought and sold on a stock exchange (just like individual stocks) and index mutual funds cannot. ETFs and index funds deliver similar returns over the long term. Of note, investment research firms report that few (if any) active funds perform better than passive funds like ETFs and index mutual funds. In nearly all cases, the need to sell securities triggers taxable events in index mutual funds. The in-kind redemption feature of ETFs eliminates the need to sell securities, so fewer taxable events occur. Of course, investors in either fund may owe capital gains taxes after selling their shares in the fund. ETFs and index mutual funds can be two smart choices for investors saving for the long run. Both are used in passive investing strategies. The biggest difference between them is that ETFs trade intraday at various prices during exchange hours and index mutual funds can be bought or sold only after the market closes each day, at a fund's net asset value.

            "title": "Regulated Investment Company (RIC): Definition, Examples, Taxes",
            "content": "Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). A regulated investment company (RIC) can be any one of several investment entities. For example, it may take the form of a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF), a real estate investment trust (REIT), or a unit investment trust (UIT). Whichever form the RIC assumes, the structure must be deemed eligible by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to pass through taxes for capital gains, dividends, or interest earned to the individual investors. A regulated investment company is qualified to pass-through income under Regulation M of the IRS, with the specific regulations for qualifying as an RIC delineated in U.S. code, title 26, sections 851 through 855, 860, and 4982. The purpose of utilizing pass-through or flow-through income is to avoid a double-taxation scenario as would be the case if both the investment company and its investors paid tax on company generated income and profits. The concept of pass-through income is also referred to as the conduit theory, as the investment company is functioning as a conduit for passing on capital gains, dividends and interest to individual shareholders. Regulated investment companies do not pay taxes on their earnings. Without the regulated investment company allowance, both the investment company and its investors would have to pay taxes on the company's capital gains or earnings. With pass-through income, the company is not required to pay corporate income taxes on profits passed through to the shareholders. The only income tax imposed is on individual shareholders. To qualify as a regulated investment company the business has to meet specific perimeters. Additionally, an RIC must derive a minimum of 90% of its income from capital gains, interest or dividends earned on investments. Further, an RIC must distribute a minimum of 90% of its net investment income in the form of interest, dividends or capital gains to its shareholders. Should the RIC not distribute this share of income, it may be subject to an excise tax by the IRS. The RIC would also have to issue an IRS Form 2439 to shareholders stating that the capital gains are being retained. Finally, to qualify as a regulated investment company, at least 50% of a company's total assets must be in the form of cash, cash equivalents or securities. No more than 25% of the company\u2019s total assets may be invested in securities of a single issuer unless the investments are government securities or the securities of other RICs. President Obama signed the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 into law Dec. 22, 2010. It made changes to the rules governing the tax treatment of regulated investment companies (RICs), including open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds, and most exchange-traded funds. The last update to the rules governing RICs was the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The primary reason for the 2010 RIC Modernization Act was due to vast changes in the mutual fund industry in the 25 years between 1986 and 2010. Further, many of the tax rules applicable to RICs became obsolete, created administrative burdens or caused uncertainty."

            "title": "Introduction to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)",
            "content": "Moon Safari / Getty Images Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were introduced in the early 1990s and have proven a durable and popular investment for many. As a result, they have expanded greatly, both in number and what they focus on over time. An ETF is like a mutual fund, but there are major distinctions between them. Both save you the time-consuming work of analyzing companies and picking stocks, though mutual funds often tend to be less tax-efficient and have higher management fees. Below, we introduce you to ETFs, explain why they've proven so popular, discuss the benefits and drawbacks that come with them, and describe what to look for when choosing among them for your portfolio. Investopedia / Zoe Hansen ETFs combine features of both mutual funds and stocks. Like mutual funds, they offer investors an interest in a professionally managed, diversified portfolio of investments. However, unlike mutual funds, ETF shares trade like stocks on exchanges, with prices fluctuating throughout the day based on market demand. For example, certain ETFs track the S&P 500 or the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, which invests in securities in those indexes. But an ETF isn't a mutual fund. Instead, it trades like the shares of a company stock on a public exchange. And, unlike a mutual fund with its net asset value (NAV) calculated at the end of each trading day, an ETF's price changes throughout the day, fluctuating with supply and demand. While ETFs attempt to replicate the returns on indexes that they track, there is no guarantee that they will do so exactly since each fund has a slight tracking error or difference between how the index would perform and how the ETF does. ETFs have grown their assets tremendously, increasing from a negligible amount of total U.S. fund assets to about 30% in late 2023, with much of the rest taken up by mutual funds. Below is a chart of their growth in assets since 2010. Investopedia Diversification Accessibility and Flexibility Low Fees Liquidity Tax Efficiency Additional Costs Potentially Excess Trading Potentially Lower Returns Diversification: ETFs offer investors instant diversification, whether across the broad market, asset classes, market sectors, or specific industries. Accessibility and flexibility: Because ETFs trade like stocks, you can buy and sell them anytime during a trading session. You can also short sell them and buy on margin. Low fees: The expense ratios of most ETFs are lower than those of the average mutual fund. The average expense ratio for an index ETF was 0.16% in 2022. As of 2024, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) had an expense ratio of 0.09%. Liquidity: Popular ETFs are highly liquid. This means they can be sold easily and at a narrower bid-ask spread. Tax efficiency: Because of their passive management, ETFs usually have fewer capital gains, which means investors may pay less in taxes. In addition, in-kind (as opposed to cash) exchanges for an ETF's securities also result in less capital gains. Additional costs: While ETFs may have low expense ratios, you may have other charges related to buying and selling ETFs, such as broker commissions/transaction costs. Moreover, you can expect higher expense ratios if you invest in an actively managed ETF. In addition, the bid-ask spread for an ETF presents a hidden cost for investors. Excess trading: Because ETFs can be bought and sold intraday, investors may forget their investment goals and trade them unnecessarily in reaction to attention-grabbing news reports or unsupported rumors. Potentially lower returns: The diversification that makes ETFs (and mutual funds) a smart way to reduce risk can also mean that returns might be less than those obtained by actively selecting and owning individual stocks. ETFs have come a long way. From $100 billion in assets under management (AUM) to $8.1 trillion AUM at the beginning of 2024. ETFs are the most common type of exchange-traded product and typically include baskets of stocks, bonds, or other assets grouped based on the fund's specific goals. Here are some of the major types you'll see as you explore this landscape, though there are hybrid ETFs that hold more than one kind of asset, and funds overlap categories. Let's first review the two broadest categories before looking at the different strategies ETFs can be based upon. Then, we introduce the categories you'll see most often as you look through your brokerage's platform. There's also a table putting the basics of each together. Unlike most ETFs, which passively track an index, these have portfolio managers who actively buy and sell securities to try to outperform a benchmark. In 2023, these made up about 15% of the ETFs trading. The first ETF in the U.S. was the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which began trading in 1993 and tracks the performance of the S&P 500 by buying the same 500 stocks and weighting them proportional to the index. Like SPY, index ETFs track the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Index funds are by far the most popular, making up over 4/5s of the assets under management in the U.S. Another example is the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 and consists of the 100 largest and most actively traded nonfinancial domestic and international\u00a0companies on the Nasdaq. It offers investors broad exposure to the tech sector. Its diversification can be a big advantage when there's volatility in the markets. If one tech company falls short of projected earnings, it will likely be hit hard, but owning a piece of a hundred other companies can cushion that blow. The world's first ETF was called the Toronto\u00a035 Index Participation Units. It was launched in 1990 by the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). Within these broad categories, you'll find funds that focus on different assets. These hold one type or a variety of bonds, providing investors with exposure to fixed-income securities. There are several subcategories of bond ETFs, each focusing on different types of bonds. Government bond ETFs invest in Treasurys and other government securities, offering exposure to debt issued by national governments. Corporate bond ETFs focus on corporate debt securities, and, lastly, high-yield bond ETFs invest in lower credit rating bonds that offer higher yields, but also come with increased risk compared with government or high-quality corporate bonds. Bond ETFs offer diversification and the potential for generating income, making them attractive to investors looking to put a portion of their portfolio into fixed-income securities. These invest either directly in physical commodities, such as gold, silver, or oil, or in commodity futures contracts. They offer exposure to commodity markets without the need for direct investment in the underlying assets. For instance, if you think that natural gas companies are a good prospect, you might consider a fund like the United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG). This ETF tracks natural gas prices by buying natural gas futures contracts. These track the performance of one or more cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has expressed concerns about market manipulation, liquidity, and the custody of assets on crypto exchanges. This kept futures-based crypto ETFs off U.S. exchanges until 2021, when ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) was approved. The approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs, like the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, marked a significant regulatory breakthrough and set a precedent for other futures-based crypto ETFs. They were approved under the idea that futures markets are more regulated and thus offer higher levels of investor protection than spot cryptocurrency markets. In January 2024, the SEC relented and allowed the first spot bitcoin\u00a0(BTCUSD) ETFs to begin trading. This set off massive buying of bitcoin in the first few months of trading, sending it up about 60% in value in the first quarter alone. In a surprise move, on May 23, 2024, the SEC approved the application of three major exchanges\u2014Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE\u2014to list ETFs tied to the price of ether. Major investment houses like Fidelity and BlackRock have since been approved for spot ether ETFs, which began trading on U.S. exchanges in July 2024. Currency ETFs are exchange-traded funds that have exposure to foreign exchange markets, allowing investors to trade currencies much like stocks. They track a single currency or basket of them, offering a way to speculate on currency moves or hedge against currency risk. Investors use currency ETFs to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional asset classes, speculate on economic conditions in different countries, or hedge against currency fluctuations in export and import-driven businesses. These focus on stocks from major indexes like SPY, sectors like health care, or offer dividends. They can also choose to invest in companies with different market capitalization or specific themes, like artificial intelligence, which might involve companies across different sectors. These have, by far, the largest market share in ETFs. These invest in a portfolio of REITs, giving you exposure to the real estate market without having to buy properties directly. The REITs whose shares the fund holds generally generate income through leasing space and collecting rents, which they then distribute to shareholders as dividends. REIT ETFs are popular for their potential to provide stable income and diversification benefits, as real estate often moves independently of stocks and bonds. Having looked at the kinds of assets that might be involved, we can now turn to the strategies different ETFs use. These funds focus on dividend-paying stocks across various sectors and provide regular income and the potential for capital appreciation. These ETFs are especially attractive to income-seeking investors, including retirees, because they distribute the dividends they collect from their underlying stock holdings to their shareholders. Dividend ETFs can vary by targeting high dividend yields, dividend growth, or stability, which allows you to choose a fund that fits your income needs and risk tolerance. These funds have been gaining market share among investors looking to make socially responsible investments. They apply ESG criteria to select stocks, aiming to invest in companies with responsible practices. However, they can vary widely in focus. Some target low-carbon emission firms, while others focus on specific themes in sustainable or other ways to have a beneficial social impact. These hold a broad range of securities from countries outside the U.S., providing exposure to international markets. Some focus on mature and growth-oriented markets, enabling you to diversify beyond your country's borders. This type of ETF particularly appeals to those looking to mitigate country-specific risks and capitalize on prospects in foreign markets. For example, if you were interested in gaining exposure to some European stocks through the Austrian market, you might consider the iShares MSCI Austrian Index fund (EWO). For emerging markets, an example includes the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index (EEM), an ETF created as an equity benchmark for international securities. Not every ETF is designed to move in the same direction or even in the same amount as the index it tracks. The prices of inverse ETFs go up when the markets go down and vice versa. They can be very useful to those investors interested in hedging portfolio risk. By buying shares in them, you're hoping to profit when the underlying index or benchmark falls. Leveraged ETFs amplify both gains and losses. Inverse ETFs, meanwhile, aim to profit from a decline in the underlying index, providing negative exposure that is typically equal to -1, -2, or -3 times the daily performance. These ETFs use financial derivatives like futures, options, and swaps to achieve their goals. For example, the Direxion Daily Financial Bear 3x Shares (FAZ) is a triple bear fund. It attempts to move 300% in value in the opposite direction of the Financial Select Sector Index. It uses derivatives and other types of leverage to boost its performance returns. However, because of their complex nature and the risks of compounding effects over longer periods, leveraged and inverse ETFs are best suited for experienced investors who understand the potential for rapid and significant value changes. These use options strategies for potential income generation, downside protection, or magnified returns compared with traditional index-tracking investments. An option is a financial derivative that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specific price, known as the strike price, on or before a specific date. Call options give the holder the right to buy an asset at the strike price within a particular time frame. Put options give the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price within a specific time frame. A common options-based strategy is the covered call, where the ETF holds an underlying asset and sells call options on it, generating income from the option premiums. Other methods include using put options for hedging or combining options for specific risk and return profiles. These are funds that hold a type of stock that shares characteristics of both equity and debt instruments. Preferred stocks come before common stocks for dividend payments and asset distribution in case of liquidation, but they usually don't carry voting rights like common stocks. They typically have higher dividends than common stocks and even some bonds, making preferred stock ETFs attractive for income-seeking investors. While generally less volatile than common stock, preferred stock ETFs can be sensitive to changes in interest rates. Like bonds, their prices typically fall as interest rates rise. Among the better-known funds is the iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF (PFF), which holds a portfolio of diverse U.S. preferred stocks. It has assets of about $15 billion, an expense ratio of 0.46%, and five-year returns of 3.01%. Preferred stock ETFs are suited for institutional investors wanting higher yields than those typically available from corporate bonds, with a moderately higher risk profile. They serve as a good tool for diversifying an income-generating portfolio, especially in a low-interest-rate environment when traditional fixed-income instruments may have lower yields. These focus on technology, health care, energy, and other parts of the economy. This allows you to gain targeted exposure to specific market areas that interest you. For example, if you're bullish on people having excess money for consumer goods, you might invest in a sector ETF to gain exposure to firms in the sector. These ETFs are also useful for diversifying without having to select individual stocks. In addition, sector funds can serve as a hedge against sector-specific risks and are valuable for thematic investing, where the investor can take positions based on expected economic shifts or trends affecting particular industries. These funds track volatility indexes, most commonly the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). The VIX measures the stock market's expectations of volatility using S&P 500 index options. Volatility ETFs are typically used as trading instruments for hedging risk or speculating on changes in market volatility rather than long-term investing. Although ETFs are tax efficient, you are taxed on any income, such as dividends and capital gains that you earn while you hold the fund and after you sell it. When reviewing specific funds, there are several of the main factors to review first: Objectives and strategies: Understand the ETF's investment objectives and strategies. Consider whether it aligns with your own goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Underlying assets: Look at the ETF's holdings and asset composition. Ensure that you understand what the ETF is invested in and you're comfortable with the risks it involves. Expense ratio: This is the annual fees charged by the fund. Lower expense ratios can help keep costs down and improve your overall returns. Tracking error: For index-tracking ETFs, consider the tracking error, which measures how closely the ETF's performance matches that of its underlying index. A lower tracking error indicates better accuracy in replicating the index's returns. Liquidity: Look at the ETF's trading volume and bid-ask spread. Higher trading volume and narrower spreads generally indicate better liquidity, making it easier to buy and sell shares at a fair price, both when entering and exiting from your position in it. Issuer and fund size: Consider the reputation and financial stability of the ETF issuer. In addition, review the fund's total AUM, as larger funds may have better liquidity and lower operating costs. Performance history: While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, reviewing an ETF's historical returns can help you consider how it's done in various market conditions. Portfolio fit: Assess how the ETF fits within your overall investment portfolio. Ensure that it contributes to the asset allocation you want and helps you maintain proper diversification. Tax implications: Be aware of the tax implications of investing in the ETF, such as capital gains distributions or tax treatment of dividends. This can help you manage your tax liability more effectively. Before investing in any ETF, always review its prospectus and related documents to gain a broad understanding of its goals, risks, fees, and other characteristics. One way to see which funds are the most popular is to look at those with the most assets under management. SPY, the first ETF, is still the biggest, with about $515 billion in AUM, an expense ratio of 0.09%, and five-year returns of 14.96%. iShares Core S&P 5000 (IVV) is next with securities related to the large-cap stocks of the S&P 500. It has assets of about $455 billion, an expense ratio of 0.03%, and five-year returns of 15.02%. At third is another S&P 500 index fund, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), with an AUM of about $435 billion, an expense ratio of 0.03%, and five-year returns of 15.01%. The largest bond ETF is the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), with about $104 billion in AUM, an expense ratio of 0.03%, and five-year returns of 0.37%. An ETF and mutual fund both pool money from investors and invest that capital in a basket of related securities. They can be actively or passively managed. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs trade like stocks and you can buy and sell them on stock exchanges. Another key difference between ETFs and mutual funds is the associated cost. Mutual funds generally charge higher management fees than ETFs. Absolutely. ETFs are commonly included in retirement portfolios because of their diversification benefits and low cost. They can be used to construct a balanced portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline while offering exposure to a wide range of asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. ETFs combine features of both mutual funds and stocks. They are listed on stock exchanges and can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like individual stocks. ETFs typically track a specific market index, sector, commodity, or other asset class, providing investors with exposure to a diverse range of securities in a single investment. Their benefits include liquidity, lower expenses than mutual funds, diversification, and tax advantages. When considering an ETF, review its goals and strategy, underlying assets, expense ratio, tracking error, liquidity, issuer and fund size, performance history, risks, and how it fits within your overall portfolio.

            "content": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning. Since their introduction in 1993, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have exploded in popularity with investors. These instruments\u2014equity portfolios tracking an index and tradable intraday like stocks\u2014have provided cost savings and diversification benefits for institutional managers as well as individuals. Of course, ETFs have pitfalls as well, from low liquidity in some cases to the risk and complexities of the most speculative varieties of exchange-traded funds. Identifying the advantages and disadvantages of ETFs can help investors decide whether these securities make sense for their portfolios, and to maximize their rewards while reducing the risks. ETFs, which compete with mutual funds and trade like stocks, have some notable advantages over both of those alternatives. One ETF can give investors exposure to many stocks from a particular industry, investment category, country, or a broad market index. ETFs can also provide exposure to asset classes other than equities, including bonds, currencies, and commodities. Portfolio diversification reduces an investor's risk. Duplicating that benefit by buying individual stocks would be much more cumbersome in terms of the time, research, and trading required, and likely more expensive. An investor requesting a mutual fund redemption during the trading day can't really be sure of the redemption price. That will depend on where the fund's net asset value lands when it's calculated at the end of the day. In contrast with mutual funds, ETFs: The most popular ETFs\u00a0trade with more liquidity than most stocks. This means that there are always plenty of buyers and sellers and narrow bid-ask spreads. ETFs, which are passively managed, tend to have significantly lower expense ratios than actively managed mutual funds. What drives up a mutual fund's expense ratio? Costs such as\u00a0a management fee, fund accounting and trading expenses, and load fees related to their sale and distribution. The dividends of the companies in an open-ended ETF are reinvested immediately, whereas the exact timing for reinvestment can vary for index mutual funds. (One exception: Dividends in unit investment trust ETFs are not automatically reinvested, thus creating a dividend drag.) ETFs can be more tax-efficient than mutual funds. As passively managed portfolios, ETFs (and index mutual funds) tend to realize fewer capital gains than actively managed mutual funds. Mutual funds, on the other hand, are required to distribute capital gains to shareholders if the manager sells securities for a profit. This distribution amount is made according to the proportion of the holders' investment and is taxable. If other mutual fund holders sell before the date of record, the remaining holders divide up the capital gain and thus pay taxes even if the fund overall went down in value. There is a lesser chance of ETF share prices being higher or lower than those of underlying shares. ETFs trade throughout the day at a price close to the price of the underlying securities, so if the price is significantly higher or lower than the net asset value, arbitrage will bring the price back in line. Unlike closed-end index funds, ETFs trade based on supply and demand, and market makers will capture price discrepancy profits. One minor risk of ETFs (though not unique to them) is shutdown risk, or the risk that an ETF will close. While shareholders would get their money back, there can be annoyances other than having to reinvest your money. These can include capital gains taxes that investors are unprepared for and potentially unexpected fees. While the pros are many, ETFs carry drawbacks too. Among them: For some sectors or foreign stocks, ETF investors might be limited to large-cap stocks due to a narrow group of equities in the market index. A lack of exposure to mid- and small-cap companies could leave potential growth opportunities out of the reach of certain ETF investors. Longer-term investors could have a time horizon of 10 to 15 or more years, and intraday price movements could induce them to trade unnecessarily. In fact, a big swing over a couple of hours could prompt emotional trading where pricing at the end of the day could keep irrational fears from distorting an investment objective. Most people compare trading ETFs with trading other funds. Yet, if you compare ETFs to investing in a specific stock, then the ETF costs are higher. The actual commission paid to the broker might be the same, but there is no management fee for a stock. Also, as more niche ETFs are created, they are more likely to follow a low-volume index. This could result in a wide bid/ask spread. Consequently, you might find a better price investing in the actual stocks. There are dividend-paying ETFs, but the yields may not be as high as those obtained by owning a high-yielding stock or group of stocks. The risks associated with owning ETFs are usually lower than those of individual stocks. But if an investor can take on the risk, then owning individual stocks can mean much higher dividend yields. While you can pick the stock with the highest dividend yield,\u00a0ETFs track a broader market, so the overall yield will average out to be lower. A leveraged ETF is a fund that uses financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index. Certain double or triple-leveraged ETFs can lose more than double or triple the value change of the tracked index. Therefore, these types of speculative investments need to be carefully evaluated. If the ETF is held for a long time, the actual loss could multiply fast. For instance, if you own a double-leveraged natural gas ETF, a 1% change in the price of natural gas should result in a 2% change in the ETF on a daily basis. However, if a leveraged ETF is held for greater than one day, the overall return from the ETF will vary significantly from the overall return on the underlying security. A double-leveraged ETF does not always mean you will see double the return of the index. And the ease of investing in leveraged ETFs could entice individuals with little experience or understanding of the investment vehicle to invest when they should not. ETFs can be a great investment for long-term investors and those with shorter-term time horizons. They can be especially valuable to beginning investors. That's because they won't require the time, effort, and experience needed to research individual stocks. The cost to own an ETF may be lower than the cost to buy a diversified selection of individual stocks, too. ETFs can be less expensive to own than mutual funds. Plus, they trade continuously throughout exchange hours, and such flexibility may matter to certain investors. ETFs also can result in lower taxes from capital gains, since they're a passive security that tracks an index. The greatest risk for investors is market risk. If the underlying index that an ETF tracks drops in value by 30% due to unfavorable market price movements, the value of the ETF will drop as well. ETFs are used by a wide variety of investors to build a portfolio or to gain exposure to specific sectors. They can make up a portion of your portfolio or be the only type of security you invest with. They are like stocks in the way\u00a0they trade but can also be compared to broader investments, or even entire indexes, in their price movements. In addition, they have many advantages, especially compared to managed funds (such as some mutual funds). But ETFs have their disadvantages. When it comes to diversification and dividends, certain ETFs may have limitations. And, investment vehicles like ETFs that live by an index can also die by an index\u2014since no nimble manager is involved to shield performance from a downward move. Finally, the tax implications of ETFs must also be considered when deciding if they are the right investment for you.

She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. monkeybusinessimages / Getty Images Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) combine some of the best characteristics of stocks and mutual funds into a single investment. They offer real-time trading flexibility like stocks and the built-in diversification of mutual funds. ETFs have been traded in U.S. markets since the early 1990s. Inflows began to take off around the turn of the millennium, when there were about 80 ETFs and $66 billion in assets under management (AUM). In the mid-2020s, there are more than 3,600 ETFs with over $11.3 trillion in AUM in worldwide. ETFs are also a significant part of the wider market, representing about 30% of the annual trading volume on U.S. exchanges. However, like any investment, ETFs have drawbacks that you should review carefully before adding them to your portfolio. ETFs have characteristics of both mutual funds and individual stocks. Their purpose is to provide investors with a convenient way to achieve diversification. Most, but not all, ETFs track a specific index, such as a stock market or bond index. Only about one in 20 ETFs actively manage their holdings. The reason is historical: early on, all ETFs were used to invest in broad indexes. However, in the 2000s, fund managers found these funds convenient for investors wanting exposure to off-exchange assets through their regular brokerage accounts. For example, the first bond, commodity, and volatility index ETFs opened in 2002, 2007, and 2009, respectively.\u00a0The first actively managed ETFs didn't appear until 2008. Still, the most-traded ETFs are passive index funds. \"With this approach, an investor can keep fees low while diversifying their portfolio across industries, sectors, and geographies,\" said\u00a0David Tenerelli, a certified financial planner at Strategic Financial Planning in Plano, Texas. \"This can result in the investor approximating 'universal ownership'\u2014owning a representative slice of the entire global economy \u2014and positioning yourself to benefit from broad economic growth, regardless of the fortunes of individual companies.\" But this, too, can have risks, like all investments, he noted, should the market the ETF tracks go down. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs trade on public exchanges like individual stocks. This means that investors can buy and sell ETF shares at prices based on supply and demand throughout the trading day. Meanwhile, mutual fund prices, valued according to their net asset values (NAVs), are calculated only at the end of each trading day. Here's a comparison of ETFs and mutual funds: While ETFs aim to replicate the returns of the indexes they track, there might be slight discrepancies between each ETF's performance and that of the index, which is called a tracking error. ETFs can be used to target specific sectors, themes, or asset classes. They can also be used to cover equities, fixed-income securities, commodities, or alternative investments. Here are the major types, and below that is a chart of their relative market share: Cryptocurrency ETFs are designed to track the performance of one or more cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin. For many years, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) kept a protective wall between American retail investors and the crypto world's well-publicized incidents ofmarket manipulation and outright fraud. However, that has been changing, with virtual currencies gradually becoming more accepted as a mainstream asset class. After rejecting applications for years, the SEC allowed bitcoin and ether futures ETFs to begin trading in 2021 and 2023, respectively. Then, in 2024, the SEC went a step further by authorizing the first spot crypto ETFs, which invest directly in the cryptocurrencies they are supposed to track rather than gaining exposure to them through future contracts. In January 2024, the SEC approved the first 11 spot bitcoin ETFs to begin trading on the NYSE Arca, Cboe BZX, and Nasdaq exchanges. Then, in May, it approved applications from Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE to list ETFs tied to the price of ether, the second most popular cryptocurrency. It then gave several issuers permission to launch spot ether ETFs, which began trading on U.S. exchanges in July 2024. These breakthroughs are a big deal for cryptocurrencies and essentially make it easier, safer, and cheaper for people to invest in them. ETFs are professionally managed by SEC-registered investment advisors. We can now discuss not just what ETFs are but their specific advantages and disadvantages. Tax efficiency and liquidity are seen as advantages, popular disadvantages are potentially lower returns and higher costs. Offers exposure to a diverse group of securities Generally cheaper than actively-managed funds Greater trading flexibility and price transparency than mutual funds You can invest in pretty much anything No minimum investment amounts beyond the share price Lower risk means lower potential returns Not all ETFs track their benchmark well Not all areas of the market are well covered Additional costs from commissions and transaction costs Some ETFs are complex and carry higher risks ETFs minimize capital gains distributions through the creation and redemption processes. This strategy is not available for mutual funds. That said, mutual funds have worked to catch up to offering the tax efficiency that ETFs have. The conventional wisdom that ETFs are more tax-efficient is still true\u2014we'll touch on the data in a second\u2014but not so much that the fund manager or family and other differences might outweigh tax efficiency when choosing between a mutual fund and an ETF. A 2024 Villanova and University of Pennsylvania study put the average annual after-tax advantage of ETFs over mutual funds at 0.92%, a significant difference. However, the study used a method that could overemphasize the differences between the funds and was based on data up to 2017. Other researchers have found the average differences to be narrower. For example, one study showed that ETFs have a 0.20% better post-tax performance than their mutual fund counterparts. The differences vary across asset classes, from 0.33% for international equity to 0.03% for fixed-income ETFs and mutual funds. ETFs are traded on stock exchanges at market prices during the trading day. You can buy and sell shares when the market opens and throughout the day until markets close. Mutual funds trade during the day, too, but you do so based on an estimate. The exact cost is calculated at the end of the day, along with the mutual fund's NAV. ETFs are usually passively managed. The portfolio manager doesn't need to analyze the specific stocks to know which to trade and how much since the index sets that. Actively managed exchange-traded and mutual funds need more staff and expertise. This dramatically reduces costs for analysts and other resources. As such, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios than mutual funds. Nevertheless, it's best to compare similar mutual and exchange-traded funds since they are often comparable, given the significant cut in mutual fund fees in recent decades. ETFs usually have to disclose their holdings, so investors are rarely left in the dark about what they hold. This transparency can help you react to changes in holdings. Mutual funds typically disclose their holdings less frequently, making it more difficult for investors to gauge precisely what is in their portfolios. This won't make much of a difference for many investors, especially when it's a passive index fund. Where transparency greatly helps is when funds are invested in off-exchange assets like currencies, crypto, real estate, and so on, where reporting requirements give you far more knowledge\u2014or at least more comfort in the veracity of fund claims\u2014than you might when accessing these assets in other ways. ETFs are designed to offer diversification by tracking a particular index or asset class. You can thus access a broad range of assets without having the cost in time or money of buying these different stocks on your own. This diversification is a key part of modern portfolio theory. While an investment in one stock or set of assets might plunge and take your entire portfolio with it, a diverse basket of assets will have some rise while others fall and vice versa. Be mindful that the underlying components of an ETF may still be correlated with each other, and you might still need to diversify\u2014a large-cap equity index should be balanced against other assets. This is especially true if they're all related to the same industry, such as an ETF investing in commercial real estate. Many ETFs have no minimum investment, making them more accessible to those without a lot of upfront capital. This accessibility allows new investors to test the waters with diversified funds. ETFs come with a wide range of benefits but also some downsides. Intraday price volatility and bid-ask spreads can occur because ETFs are traded throughout the day and face the same market risks as other securities. Investors have flexibility in selling their ETF shares exactly when they want, but this can mean the ETF's prices can be volatile. Some ETFs, like leveraged and inverse ETFs, can be complex and have higher risks. You'll want to have a thorough understanding of their strategies before investing. Leveraged ETFs magnify the potential return of another ETF, providing greater potential returns and losses. Inverse ETFs attempt to take the opposite position and bet on the inverse of a stock or index. Another drawback to ETFs is that with most, you can only match the market\u2014most are index funds, after all\u2014not beat it. These are among the most traded ETFs: Real estate ETFs invest in publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) or companies active in the real estate market through development, management, and ownership. These ETFs offer investors exposure to the real estate market without the need to directly invest in physical properties. Real estate ETFs often focus on specific types of properties, such as residential, commercial, or industrial real estate, or geographic regions.  Yes. There's even a category of ETFs that focus on providing them. Dividend ETFs look to hold stocks across various sectors that pay these distributions. They can provide regular income and the potential for capital appreciation. Dividend funds are especially attractive to income-seeking investors, including retirees. Tracking error is the deviation between an ETF's performance and that of its benchmark index. This can occur because of management fees, dividend reinvestment, or the bid-ask spread. Although tracking errors are typically small, they're important for investors to consider when evaluating an ETF's performance relative to its benchmark. ETFs have elements of both mutual funds and stocks. Listed on stock exchanges, they can be traded throughout the day like individual stocks. ETFs typically track a specific market index, sector, commodity, or other asset class, exposing investors to a range of securities in a single investment. Their benefits include liquidity, lower expenses than mutual funds, diversification, and tax advantages.

            "title": "Tracking Error: Definition, Factors That Affect It, and Example",
            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Tracking error is the divergence between the price behavior of a position or a portfolio and the price behavior of a benchmark. This is often in the context of a\u00a0hedge fund,\u00a0mutual fund,\u00a0or exchange-traded fund\u00a0(ETF) that did not work as effectively as intended, creating an unexpected profit or loss. Tracking error is reported as a standard deviation percentage difference, which reports the difference between the return an investor receives and that of the benchmark they were attempting to imitate. Investopedia / Julie Bang Since portfolio risk is often measured against a benchmark, tracking error is a commonly used metric to gauge how well an investment is performing. Tracking error shows an investment's consistency versus a benchmark over a given period of time. Even portfolios that are perfectly indexed against a benchmark behave differently than the benchmark, even though this difference on a day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, or year-to-year basis may be ever so slight. The measure of tracking error is used to quantify this difference. Tracking error is the standard deviation of the difference between the returns of an investment and its benchmark. Given a sequence of returns for an investment or portfolio and its benchmark, tracking error is calculated as follows: From an investor's point of view, tracking error can be used to evaluate portfolio managers. If a manager is realizing low average returns and has a large tracking error, it is a sign that there is something significantly wrong with that investment and that the investor should most likely find a replacement. It may also be used to forecast performance, particularly for quantitative portfolio managers who construct risk models that include the likely factors that influence price changes. The managers then construct a portfolio that uses the type of constituents of a benchmark (such as style, leverage, momentum, or market cap) to create a portfolio that will have a tracking error that closely adheres to the benchmark. The\u00a0net asset value\u00a0(NAV)\u00a0of an index fund is naturally inclined toward being lower than its benchmark because funds have fees, whereas an index does not. A high\u00a0expense ratio\u00a0for a fund can have a significantly negative impact on the fund's performance. However, it is possible for fund managers to overcome the negative impact of fund fees and outperform the underlying index by doing an above-average job of portfolio\u00a0rebalancing, managing dividends or interest payments, or securities lending. Beyond fund fees, a number of other factors can affect a fund's tracking error. One important factor is the extent to which a fund's holdings match the holdings of the underlying index or benchmark. Many funds are made up of just the fund manager's idea of a representative sample of the securities that make up the actual index. There are frequently also\u00a0differences in weighting between a fund's assets and the assets of the index. Illiquid\u00a0or thinly-traded securities can also increase the chance of a tracking error, since this often leads to prices\u00a0differing significantly from market price when the fund buys or sells such securities as a result of larger\u00a0bid-ask spreads. Finally, the level of volatility for an index can also affect the tracking error. Sector,\u00a0international,\u00a0and\u00a0dividend ETFs\u00a0tend to have higher absolute tracking errors; broad-based equity and\u00a0bond ETFs\u00a0tend\u00a0to have lower ones.\u00a0Management expense ratios\u00a0(MER) are the most prominent cause of tracking error and there tends to be a direct correlation between the size of the MER and tracking error. But other factors can intercede and be more significant at times. Premiums\u00a0or\u00a0discounts\u00a0to\u00a0NAV may occur when investors bid the market price of an ETF above or below the NAV of its basket of\u00a0securities. Such divergences are usually rare. In the case of a premium, the authorized participant typically\u00a0arbitrages\u00a0it away by purchasing securities in the ETF basket, exchanging them for ETF units, and selling the units on the stock market to earn a profit (until the premium is gone). Premiums and discounts as high as 5% have been known to occur, particularly for thinly traded ETFs. When there are thinly traded stocks in the benchmark index, the ETF provider can't buy them without pushing their prices up substantially, so it uses a sample containing the more liquid stocks to proxy the index. This is called portfolio optimization. ETFs are registered with regulators as\u00a0mutual funds\u00a0and need to abide by the applicable regulations. Of note are two diversification requirements: 75% of its assets must be invested in cash, government securities, and securities of other investment companies, and no more than 5% of the total assets can be invested in any one security. This can create problems for ETFs tracking the performance of a sector where there are a lot of dominant companies. Indexes don't have cash holdings, but ETFs do. Cash can accumulate at intervals due to\u00a0dividend\u00a0payments, overnight balances, and trading activity. The lag between receiving and reinvesting the cash can lead to a\u00a0decline in performance known as drag. Dividend funds with high payout\u00a0yields\u00a0are most susceptible. ETFs track indexes and when the indexes are updated, the ETFs have to follow suit. Updating the ETF\u00a0portfolio\u00a0incurs transaction costs. And it may not always be possible to do it the same way as the index. For example, a stock added to the ETF may be at a different price than what the index maker selected. ETFs are more tax-efficient than mutual funds but have nevertheless been known to distribute\u00a0capital gains\u00a0that are taxable in the hands of unitholders. Although it may not be immediately apparent, these distributions create a different performance than the index on an after-tax basis. Indexes with a high level of turnover in companies (e.g.,\u00a0mergers,\u00a0acquisitions,\u00a0and\u00a0spin-offs) are one source of capital-gains distributions. The higher the turnover rate, the higher the likelihood the ETF will be compelled to sell securities at a profit. Some ETF companies may offset tracking errors through\u00a0security lending, which is the practice of lending out holdings in the ETF portfolio to\u00a0hedge funds\u00a0for\u00a0short selling. The lending fees collected from this practice can be used to lower tracking error if so desired. International ETFs with currency hedging may not follow a benchmark index due to the costs of currency hedging, which are not always embodied in the MER. Factors affecting hedging costs include market volatility and interest-rate differentials, which impact the pricing and performance of forward contracts. Commodity ETFs,\u00a0in many cases, track the price of a\u00a0commodity\u00a0through the\u00a0futures markets, buying the contract closest to expiry. As the weeks pass and the contract nears expiration, the ETF provider will sell it (to avoid taking delivery) and buy the next month's contract. This operation, known as the \"roll,\" is repeated every month. If contracts further from expiration have higher prices (contango), the roll into the next month will be at a higher price, which incurs a loss. Thus, even if the spot price of the commodity stays the same or rises slightly, the ETF could still show a decline. Vice versa, if futures further away from expiration have lower prices (backwardation), the ETF will have an upward bias. \ufeffLeveraged and inverse ETFs use\u00a0swaps, forwards, and futures to replicate on a daily basis two or three times the direct or inverse return of a benchmark index. This requires rebalancing the basket of derivatives daily to ensure they deliver the specified multiple of the index's change each day. Tracking error and beta are different. Generally speaking, a portfolio may have less tracking error if it has a lower beta (since it will move closer to the broad market moves). However, this is not always the case. Ex-post tracking error, also known as realized tracking error, is a backward-looking measure. It provides a factual account of how closely the portfolio has tracked its benchmark over a specific period in the past. Ex-post tracking error is useful for performance evaluation, as it shows the actual deviation that occurred between the portfolio and its benchmark. Ex-ante tracking error, on the other hand, is a forward-looking estimate that attempts to predict how much a portfolio might deviate from its benchmark in the future. This measure is typically calculated using risk models, factor analysis, and statistical techniques that consider the current portfolio composition. Ex-ante tracking error is most useful in risk management and portfolio construction. Aside from the usefulness mentioned above, the key difference between these two types of tracking errors lie in their calculation methods. Ex-post uses actual historical returns, while ex-ante uses predictive models and current portfolio characteristics. For this reason, it may be easier to get ex-post data as that is based on actuals; in order to determine an ex-ante tracking error, you have to come up with the future data yourself. A variety of tools and software solutions are available for analyzing tracking error depending on your size and need. At the most basic level for retail investors or recreational investors, spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets can be used to calculate tracking error. You'd have to manually input portfolio and benchmark returns, but you can leverage spreadsheet formulas to compute both ex-post tracking error and basic ex-ante estimates. More advanced options for sophisticated investors or day traders include specialized financial software packages such as Morningstar Direct or through a Bloomberg Terminal. These platforms offer automated data feeds, pre-built analytics tools, and customizable reporting where you can set up your portfolio and the tracking errors are calculated for you. For institutional investors and large asset managers, there are more sophisticated risk management and portfolio analytics systems like BlackRock's Aladdin, MSCI Barra, or Axioma. These platforms provide advanced modeling capabilities. These types of platforms often integrate with trading systems and can provide real-time analytics. Assume that there is a large-cap mutual fund benchmarked to the S&P 500 index. Next, assume that the mutual fund and the index realized the following returns over a given five-year period: Given this data, the series of differences is then (11% - 12%), (3% - 5%), (12% - 13%), (14% - 9%) and (8% - 7%). These differences equal -1%, -2%, -1%, 5%, and 1%. The standard deviation of this series of differences, the tracking error, is 2.50%. Tracking error is a measure of how closely a portfolio follows the index to which it is benchmarked. It is defined as the standard deviation of the difference between the portfolio and index returns over time. Tracking error is calculated by taking the standard deviation of the difference between the portfolio returns and the benchmark returns over a specified period. First, you calculate the difference in returns for each period (often daily or monthly). Then, you find the average of these differences. Finally, you calculate the standard deviation of these differences. The resulting figure represents the tracking error, typically expressed as a percentage. Several factors can contribute to tracking errors. These include transaction costs, management fees, cash drag (such as uninvested cash in the portfolio), differences in portfolio composition compared to the index, timing of rebalancing, dividend reinvestment policies, and corporate actions like mergers or spin-offs. Tracking error is important because it provides investors with a measure of how well an index fund or ETF is replicating its benchmark. A low tracking error suggests that the fund is achieving its goal of mimicking the index, which is important for passive investment strategies. Tracking error is a measure of how closely a portfolio follows its benchmark index, typically calculated as the standard deviation of the difference between the portfolio and index returns over time. It's crucial for evaluating the performance of index funds and ETFs, with lower tracking errors indicating better replication of the benchmark.

            "content": "The emergence of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over the recent past has been great for investors, as it has made low-cost opportunities available for nearly every asset class in the market. However, their success also means investors are confronted with about 10,000\u00a0ETF choices, a daunting task for the weekend investor. You don't have to choose just one. Once you know the basics of ETFs, you can consider building an all-ETF portfolio that meets your tolerance for risk and your financial goals while retaining the low investing fees that made ETFs so popular in the first place. ETFs are baskets of individual securities, much like mutual funds\u00a0but\u00a0with two key differences. First, ETFs are traded on exchanges like stocks, while mutual fund transactions don't occur until the market closes for the day. Second,\u00a0expense ratios\u00a0tend to be lower. Most ETFs are passively managed vehicles that simply reflect the contents of an underlying\u00a0index\u00a0or other benchmark. They should virtually duplicate the performance of the benchmark. Many mutual funds\u00a0are actively\u00a0managed. They usually have higher fees because there are financial professionals behind the scenes buying and selling assets from day to day. Their goal is to beat the performance of a particular benchmark, but there's no guarantee that they will. In any type of fund, the chief benefit is diversification. Investing in an ETF that tracks a financial services index gives you\u00a0ownership in a basket of financial stocks versus a single financial company. As the old clich\u00e9 goes, you do not want to put all your eggs into one basket. An ETF can guard against volatility (up to a\u00a0point)\u00a0if\u00a0some stocks within the ETF fall. This removal of\u00a0company-specific risk is the biggest draw\u00a0for most ETF investors. Another benefit of ETFs is the exposure they can give a portfolio to alternative asset classes, such as commodities,\u00a0currencies, and real estate. When determining which ETFs are\u00a0best suited for your portfolio, there are a number of\u00a0factors to\u00a0consider. First, you should look at the top holdings of the ETF. The name alone is not enough information. For instance, a number of ETFs are made up of water-related stocks. However, when the top holdings of each are analyzed, it is clear\u00a0they take\u00a0different approaches to this niche sector. While one ETF may be composed of water utilities, another\u00a0may have\u00a0infrastructure stocks as the top holdings. The focus of each ETF will result in varying returns. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, it is important to compare how similar ETFs have performed. And, though most ETFs have low fees, watch out for any notable differences in expense ratios that can cut into your returns. Another factor to pay attention to\u00a0is the total amount of assets under management (AUM). An ETF with low AUM could be in danger of liquidation. Also look at\u00a0the daily average volume, and the bid/ask spread. Low volume indicates\u00a0low liquidity, which will make it more difficult to get in and out of shares. If you are considering building a portfolio with ETFs, here are some simple guidelines: Consider your objective for this portfolio (e.g., retirement or saving for a child's college tuition),\u00a0your return and risk expectations, your time horizon (the longer it is, the more risk you can take), your distribution needs (if you have income needs, you will have to add\u00a0fixed-income\u00a0ETFs and/or\u00a0equity\u00a0ETFs that pay higher dividends), your tax and legal situations, your personal situation, and how this portfolio fits within your overall investment strategy. All of these factors go into determining your\u00a0asset allocation. If you are knowledgeable about investments, you may be able to handle this yourself. If not, seek help from a financial adviser. Then consider some data on market returns. Research by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French resulted in the formation of the\u00a0three-factor model\u00a0in evaluating market returns. According to this model: Therefore, investors with a higher risk tolerance can and should allocate a significant portion of their portfolios to small-cap, value-oriented equities. Remember that more than 90% of a portfolio's return is determined by allocation rather than security selection and timing. Do not try to time the market. Research continually has shown that timing the market is not a winning strategy. Once you have determined the right allocation, you are ready to implement your strategy. The beauty of ETFs is that you can select an ETF for each sector or index in which you want exposure. Analyze the available funds and determine which ones will best meet your allocation targets. Placing all your buy orders in one day is not a prudent strategy. Ideally, you would want to look at the charts for support levels and try to buy on dips. Phase in your purchases over a period of three to six months. At the time of purchase, many investors\u00a0will place a stop-loss order that will limit\u00a0potential losses. Ideally, the stop-loss should be no more than 20% below the original entry price and should be moved up accordingly\u00a0as the ETF gains in price. At least once a year, check the performance of your portfolio. For most investors, depending on their tax circumstances, the ideal time to do this is at the beginning or end of the calendar year. Compare each ETF's performance to that of its benchmark index. Any difference, called\u00a0tracking error, should be low. If it is not, you may need to replace that fund with one that will stay truer to its stated style. Do not overtrade. A once-a-quarter or annual rebalancing is recommended for most portfolios. Don't be deterred by short-term market fluctuations. Stay true to your original allocations. Assess your portfolio in light of changes in your circumstances, but be sure to keep a long-term perspective. Your allocation will change over time as your circumstances change. If your plan is to have a portfolio made up solely of ETFs,\u00a0make sure multiple\u00a0asset classes are included to create diversification. As an example, you could\u00a0start by focusing\u00a0on three areas: Note that these are suggested areas to focus on.\u00a0It's all about your preferences. Roboadvisors, which are increasingly popular, can build all-ETF portfolios for their users. An ETF is a pool of money from many shareholders. Most ETFs are passively managed funds that track a particular index or other benchmark. That is, the money is invested solely in the assets contained in the index, following the same weightings as are used to create the index. The performance should be virtually identical to the performance of the benchmark. ETFs are similar to mutual funds, but they are traded on an exchange, like stocks. Mutual funds can only be sold at the end of a trading day. ETFs also have very low fees, especially if they are passively managed. It is worth noting that mutual fund fees have dropped sharply due to the competition from ETFs. Also, some mutual funds also are passively-managed and have correspondingly low fees. The biggest brands of ETFs in terms of assets under management (AUM) are iShares (issued by BlackRock); Vanguard; SPDR (issued by State Street Global Advisors); Invesco, and Charles Schwab. Like every asset available to an investor, an ETF can be very safe, not-so-safe, or downright risky. The relative safety of an ETF depends on the risk levels of the investments within it. You can now invest in bitcoin futures through ETFs. Or, you can invest in triple A-rated bonds. Over time, there will be ups and downs in the markets and in individual stocks, but a low-cost portfolio made up entirely of ETFs could ease volatility and help you achieve your investment goals.

            "content": "Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Most exchange-traded funds (ETFs) seek to duplicate the returns of an index or other benchmark. Leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) try to deliver a greater return. As with other ETFs, the investor can choose an ETF that is based on the S&P 500 Index or the Nasdaq 100, or one of many that tracks a specific sector or industry group. Like stocks, shares of ETFs are traded on a public exchange. Like mutual funds, ETFs allow individual investors to benefit from the diversification and economies of scale that come from joining a large pool of money contributed by many investors. Most ETFs are passive investments. They invest strictly in the stocks, bonds, or other assets that are listed in a particular index such as the S&P 500, buying and selling only when the index is revised. The first leveraged ETFs were introduced in the summer of 2006, after being reviewed for about six years by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Like other ETFs, leveraged ETFs often mirror an index fund, and the fund's capital, in addition to investor equity, provides a higher level of investment exposure. Typically, a leveraged ETF will maintain a $2 exposure or $3 exposure to the index for every $1 of investor capital. The fund's goal is to have future appreciation of the investments made with the borrowed capital to exceed the cost of the capital itself. Long before ETFs were introduced, the first investment funds that were listed on stock exchanges were called closed-end funds, meaning that the number of shares issued was fixed. Their pricing was set by supply and demand, and often deviated from the value of the assets in the fund, or net asset value (NAV). This confused and deterred many would-be investors. ETFs solved this problem by allowing management to create and redeem shares as needed. This made the fund open-ended rather than closed-ended and created an arbitrage opportunity for management that helps keep share prices in line with the underlying NAV. As a result, even ETFs with very limited trading volume have share prices that are almost identical to their NAVs. It's important to know that ETFs are almost always fully invested; the constant creation and redemption of shares can increase transaction costs because the fund must resize its investment portfolio. These transaction costs are borne by all investors in the fund. While all ETFs have expenses, they are generally very low compared to those for actively managed mutual funds. On the other hand, the expenses for most index mutual funds have been greatly reduced to compete with those of index ETFs. Check the \"expense ratio\" of any fund you're considering. Leveraged ETFs respond to share creation and redemption by increasing or reducing their exposure to the underlying index using derivatives. The derivatives most commonly used are index futures, equity swaps, and index options. The typical holdings of a leveraged index fund include a large amount of cash invested in short-term securities and a smaller but highly volatile portfolio of derivatives. The cash is used to meet any financial obligations that arise from losses on the derivatives. There are also inverse-leveraged ETFs that use the same derivatives to attain short exposure to the underlying ETF or index. These funds profit when the index declines and take losses when the index rises. Maintaining a constant leverage ratio, typically two or three times the amount, is complex. Fluctuations in the price of the underlying index change the value of the leveraged fund's assets, and this requires the fund to change the total amount of index exposure. As an example, say a fund has $100 million of assets and $200 million of index exposure. The index rises 1% on the first day of trading, giving the firm $2 million in profits. (Assume no expenses in this example.) The fund now has $102 million of assets and must increase (in this case, double) its index exposure to $204 million. Maintaining a constant leverage ratio allows the fund to immediately reinvest trading gains. This constant adjustment, called rebalancing, is how the fund is able to provide double the exposure to the index at any point in time, even if the index has recently gained 50% or lost 50%. Without rebalancing, the fund's leverage ratio would change every day, and the fund's returns (as compared to the underlying index) would be unpredictable. In declining markets, rebalancing a leveraged fund with long exposure can be problematic. Reducing the index exposure allows the fund to survive a downturn and limits future losses, but also locks in trading losses and leaves the fund with a smaller asset base. For instance, say the index loses 1% every day for four days in a row and then gains +4.1% on the fifth day, which allows it to recover all of its losses. How would a two-times leveraged ETF based on this index perform during this same period? By the end of the week, our index had returned to its starting point, but our leveraged ETF was still down slightly (0.2%). This is not a rounding error. It's a result of the proportionally smaller asset base in the leveraged fund, which requires a larger return, 8.42% to be exact, to return to its original level. This effect is small in this example but can be significant over longer periods of time in very volatile markets. The larger the percentage drops are, the larger the differences will be. Simulating daily rebalancing is mathematically simple. All that needs to be done is to double the daily index return. What is considerably more complex is estimating the impact of fees on the daily returns of the portfolio. Suppose an investor analyzes monthly returns of the S&P 500 over the past three years and finds that the average monthly return is 0.9%, and the standard deviation of those returns is 2%. Assuming that future returns conform to recent historical averages, the two-times leveraged ETF based upon this index will be expected to return twice the expected return with twice the expected volatility (i.e., 1.8% monthly return with a 4% standard deviation). Most of this gain would come in the form of capital gains rather than dividends. The management expense is the fee levied by the company that offers the fund. This fee is detailed in the prospectus and can be more than 1% of the fund's assets. These fees cover both marketing and fund administration costs. All derivatives have an interest rate built into their pricing. This rate, known as the risk-free rate, is very close to the short-term rate on U.S. government securities. Buying and selling these derivatives also results in transaction expenses. Interest and transaction expenses can be hard to identify and calculate because they are not individual line items but a gradual reduction of fund profitability. One approach that works well is to compare a leveraged ETF's performance against its underlying index for several months and examine the differences between expected and actual returns. Suppose a two-times leveraged small-cap ETF has assets of $500 million, and the appropriate index is trading for $50. The fund purchases derivatives to simulate $1 billion of exposure to the appropriate small-cap index, or 20 million shares, using a combination of index futures, index options, and equity swaps. The fund maintains a large cash position to offset potential declines in the index futures and equity swaps. This cash is invested in short-term securities and helps offset the interest costs associated with these derivatives. Every day, the fund rebalances its index exposure based upon fluctuations in the price of the index and on share creation and redemption obligations. During the year, this fund generates $33 million of expenses, as detailed below. In one year, the index increases 10%, to $55, and the 20 million shares are now worth $1.1 billion. The fund has generated capital gains and dividends of $100 million and incurred $33 million in total expenses. After all the expenses are backed out, the resultant gain, $67 million, represents a 13.4% gain for the investors in the fund. On the other hand, if the index had declined 10%, to $45, the result would be a very different story. Investors would have lost $133 million, or 25% of their invested capital. The fund would also sell some of these depreciated securities to reduce index exposure to $734 million, or twice the amount of investor equity (now $367 million). This example does not take into account daily rebalancing. Long sequences of good or bad daily returns can have a noticeable impact on the fund's shareholdings and performance. The ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF is among the more actively traded leveraged funds. Trading under the ticker SQQQ, the fund is designed to move three times the daily changes in the Nasdaq 100 Index. A 2x leveraged ETF is designed to move twice as much as the amount the underlying asset or sector moves. A 3x leveraged ETF is created to move three times as much as the underlying asset or sector. There are several reasons that triple-leveraged CDs are not usually considered prudent long-term investments. The biggest of those reasons is the drag from market volatility and the leverage costs over time. Leveraged ETFs, like most ETFs, are simple to buy and sell, but there is far greater complexity behind the scenes. Fund management is constantly buying and selling derivatives to maintain a target index exposure. This results in interest and transaction expenses and significant fluctuations in index exposure due to daily rebalancing. Because of these factors, it is impossible for any of these funds to provide twice the return of the index for long periods of time. The best way to develop realistic performance expectations for these products is to study the ETF's past daily returns as compared to those of the underlying index. For investors already familiar with leveraged investing, leveraged ETFs may have little to offer. These investors will probably be more comfortable managing their own portfolios, and directly controlling their index exposure and leverage ratio.

            "title": "How To Use a VIX ETF in Your Portfolio",
            "content": "When it comes to investing, market volatility--that is, the combination of the speed and magnitude at which prices change day in and day out--is a critical measure to pay attention to. The Cboe Global Markets\u00a0(Cboe)\u00a0has created a handy financial tool to track market volatility, known simply as Volatility Index, but better known by its acronym, the VIX. The VIX index is generated from the implied volatilities extracted from prices of index options on the S&P 500, and is intended to reflect the market's expectation of 30-day volatility. Keeping an eye on market volatility is one thing. But investors can also benefit by trading securities that track the value of the VIX itself. Here, we consider using VIX ETFs. Referred to as the so-called \"fear index,\" the VIX is commonly used to gauge investor confidence in the market, or, conversely, as a way of understanding how fearful market participants are that volatility will plague the space. The VIX tends to be largely based on stock market reactions; for instance, when the prices of stocks fall, VIX tends to increase, often to an exaggerated degree. VIX is an incredibly useful tool for mainstream investors looking to trade in stocks directly. However, investors can also trade based on the VIX in other ways as well. For example, the Cboe Volatility Suite offers both VIX options and VIX futures. These allow investors to make wagers based on the volatility index itself, rather than on the changes to individual names it attempts to represent. Because of the large-scale reactions common to the Volatility Index, traders and investors are often interested in trading based on VIX. It is perhaps unsurprising that there is also a growing field of VIX-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These products are a bit more complex than standard ETFs that track a basket of stocks. However, there are nonetheless compelling reasons to consider VIX ETFs. In doing so, though, investors should pay careful attention to how VIX ETFs work and learn about the potential risks and rewards associated with this subcategory of the ETF space. VIX ETFs are a bit of a misnomer. Investors are not able to access the VIX index directly. Rather, VIX ETFs most commonly track VIX futures indexes. This characteristic of VIX ETFs introduces a number of risks that investors should keep in mind, and that will be detailed below. It also introduces the opportunity for a variety of different types of products within the VIX ETF category. Furthermore, most VIX ETFs are, in fact, exchange-traded notes (ETNs), which carry the counterparty risk of issuing banks. This is not typically a major concern for VIX ETF investors. One of the most popular VIX ETFs is the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX). This product maintains a long position in first- and second-month VIX futures contracts, which roll daily. VXX tends to trade higher than it would otherwise during periods of low present volatility as a result of the tendency for volatility to revert to the mean. Inverse\u00a0VIX ETFs are those that profit from the opposite movement of the VIX. When volatility is high, stock market performance usually goes down; an investment in an inverse volatility ETF can help to protect a portfolio during these highly turbulent times. On the other hand, when the VIX climbed by a massive 115% early in 2018, many products that short futures connected to the VIX were decimated. Indeed, both the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN and the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Medium-Term ETN shut down in 2020, in part, as a result of this movement. One example of a popular inverse VIX ETF is the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY). Based on VIX short-term futures as an index benchmark, this ETF provides an 0.5x inverse exposure to the underlying index, meaning that it is not a leveraged ETF.For 2017, SVXY returned a whopping 181.84%. However, just as volatility itself can be highly volatile, so too can VIX ETFs; in 2018 through mid-July, the SVXY product had returned -91.75%. Other inverse ETFs make use of S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures as an index. Products like the now delisted VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Medium-Term ETN (ZIV) managed to bring in returns of almost 90% in 2017 thanks to this strategy. One issue inherent in VIX ETFs is that the VIX itself is more accurately described as a measure of \"implied\" volatility, rather than volatility directly. Because it is a weighted mixture of the prices for different S&P 500 index options, VIX measures how much investors are willing to pay to be able to buy or sell the S&P 500. Beyond this, VIX ETFs are known for not being great at mirroring the VIX. One-month ETN proxies captured only about 25% to 50% of daily VIX moves, and mid-term products tend to perform even worse in this respect. The reason for this is that VIX futures indexes (the benchmarks for VIX ETFs) tend to be unsuccessful at emulating the VIX index. In addition, VIX ETF positions tend to decay over time as a result of the behavior of the VIX futures curve. As this decay takes place, these ETFs have less money to use to roll into subsequent futures contracts as existing ones expire. As time goes on, this process repeats itself multiple times, and most VIX ETFs end up losing money over the long term. As the examples above illustrate, VIX ETFs are incredibly finicky. Inverse volatility ETFs experience massive losses when volatility levels in the market spike. This can be so dramatic that these ETFs can be virtually annihilated due to a single bad day or period of high volatility. For this reason, inverse volatility ETFs are not an investment for the faint-hearted, nor are they an appropriate investment for those\u00a0without a strong knowledge of how volatility works. Interested investors should carefully consider the personnel managing any inverse volatility product before making an investment. It's also likely a good choice to see investments in inverse VIX ETFs as an opportunity for short-term gains, rather than for long-term buy-and-hold\u00a0strategies. The volatility of these ETFs is too extreme to make them a suitable long-term investment option. Investors interested in the VIX ETF space should\u00a0consider investing for a short period of perhaps a day. Many of these products are highly liquid, offering excellent opportunities for speculation. VIX ETFs are highly risky, but when traded carefully, they can prove to be lucrative.

            "title": "Leveraged ETFs: The Potential for Big Gains\u2014and Bigger Losses",
            "content": "James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). A leveraged exchange traded fund (LETF) is a security that uses financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index or other assets it tracks. Some leveraged or \"geared\" ETFs track single stocks and crypto market or futures prices, which can make an already volatile trading strategy far more combustible. While a traditional ETF typically tracks the securities in its underlying index on a one-to-one basis, an LETF will typically aim for a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio. These products are available for most indexes, such as the Nasdaq 100 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) first allowed LETFs in 2006. Since then, market analysts have been concerned about their effect on overall market volatility since they can magnify major swings in the market. But they also, as we do here, never fail to warn investors to avoid them as long-term investments. They are meant for day-to-day trading, and their results over longer periods are unpredictable and can significantly compound losses. For these reasons, they come under perennial regulatory scrutiny. Before investing in one, read the prospectus and understand the mechanics of these complicated trading instruments. ETFs sell like other securities on the stock market and contain a basket of securities. These securities could be from an index they track, a hand-picked theme of stocks, or individual stocks, derivatives, fixed-income securities, and currency. For example, ETFs that track the S&P 500 Index typically contain the 500-plus stocks in the S&P 500. So, if the S&P moves by 1%, the ETF will also move by 1%. An LETF that tracks the S&P 500 would use financial products and debt that magnify each 1% gain in the S&P to a 2% or 3% gain. The extent of the gain depends on the amount of leverage used. Leveraging is an investing strategy that uses borrowed funds to buy futures and other derivatives to increase the impact of changes in price. LETFs primarily use futures contracts, index futures, and swap agreements to magnify the daily returns of the underlying index, stock, or other tracked assets. These derivatives are needed for the daily rebalancing these LETFs require. This leverage can work in the opposite direction and lead to magnified losses. If the underlying index falls by 1%, the loss is exaggerated by the leverage. Investors should be aware of the risks of LETFs since the risk of loss is far higher than that of traditional investments. As D.J. Abner notes in his \"ETF Handbook,\" while investors notoriously fail to read prospectuses and investor warnings before putting money into securities, investing in an LETF is decidedly not the time to do so. Lastly, the management fees and transaction costs associated with LETFs can diminish the fund's return. For the 191 LETFs it tracks in the U.S. markets, ETF.com puts the average expense ratio at 1.04%. An LETF applies derivatives to magnify the exposure to a particular index or other targeted asset (stocks, cryptocurrency, commodities, etc.). Most do not aim to amplify the monthly or annual returns of the target assets but instead track daily changes, resetting each day. However, longer reset periods, such as one month, can be used. The leverage in LETFs comes from several sources. First, it can come from borrowing. For instance, the fund that aims to have twice the return of the targeted assets might take your invested funds and then borrow the same amount to effectively double how much is invested. LETFs also employ derivatives like forward contracts, futures contracts, total return swaps, and, less frequently, options: Employing derivatives for generating returns is a method known as \"synthetic replication\" (the flip side of \"physical\" replication, directly borrowing), which is generally more efficient than borrowing to buy the securities of the benchmark. Regarding options, they have upfront fees called premiums that allow investors to buy many shares of a security. As a result, options layered with investments, such as stocks, can add to the gains for LETFs over 1:1 traditional ETFs. A leveraged inverse ETF attempts to use its leverage to make money when the underlying index is declining in value. In other words, an inverse ETF rises while the underlying index is falling, allowing investors to profit from a bearish market or market declines. Along with management and transaction fee expenses, there are other costs associated with LETFs. These funds have higher fees than non-leveraged ETFs because premiums, fees, and interest need to be paid on the derivatives and for margin costs. Many LETFs have expense ratios of 1% or more. Despite the higher expense ratios associated with LETFs, they are often less expensive than other forms of margin. Trading on margin involves a broker lending money to a customer so that the borrower can buy securities with the securities held as collateral for the loan. The broker also charges an interest rate for the margin loan. For example, short selling, which involves borrowing shares from a broker to bet on a downward move, can carry fees of 3% or more on the amount borrowed. Using margin to buy stock can become similarly expensive and can result in margin calls should the position begin losing money. A margin call happens when a broker asks for more money to shore up the account if the collateral securities are losing value and fall below a certain minimum. LETFs are typically used by day traders speculating on an index or other targeted sets of assets. It is difficult to hold long-term investments in LETFs because the derivatives used for the leverage are not long-term investments. As a result, traders often hold positions in LETFs for day trading. These ETFs should not be used for long-term strategies since they're anchored in techniques for returns within a trading day, not a longer time, and the daily reset means the fund can't build on itself. If you want ETFs for long-term investing, there are myriad financial products designed for this strategy. LETFs offer the potential for significant gains that exceed the tracked index or assets. Investors have a wide variety of securities to trade using LETFs. Investors can make money when the market is declining using inverse LETFs. LETFs can lead to significant losses that exceed the tracked index or assets. LETFs have higher fees and expense ratios compared with traditional ETFs. LETFs are not long-term investments. The Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3x Shares\u00a0(FAS) ETF holds equities in large U.S. financial companies. It has an expense ratio of 0.94%, and it tracks securities listed on the Financial Select Sector Index (IXMTR, an index of financial sector stocks listed on the S&P 500) and includes Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), Visa (V), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), and other financial sector companies. This LETF aims to provide investors three times (3x) the return on the moves in the financial stocks it tracks. To do this, the fund invests in swap agreements and securities. For instance, suppose an investor bought $10,000 of FAS, and the underlying financial stocks rose by 1% in a single day; FAS would provide 3% returns on that day. This means the $10,000 investment would increase to $10,300 at the end of the day before fees. Conversely, if the tracked financial stocks declined 2% in a day, FAS would post a 6% decline for that same day. So, the original $10,000 investment would decrease to $9,400 before accounting for fees. As this example shows, the multiplier works both ways. You can get multiplied gains during a positive performance and multiplied losses when the index declines. The daily reset mechanism causes LETFs to rebalance their portfolios daily to maintain their leverage. Thus, they won't necessarily work for a buy-and-hold strategy since their returns are a function of maintaining debt to equity within each fund. This resetting effect allows the ETF to seek 3x leverage daily but can cause longer-term returns to diverge significantly from simply compounding the underlying index's returns. To demonstrate this, here is an example covering several days. Let's assume the underlying financial index FAS tracks has the following daily returns: We need to triple each of these for the expected return of FAS, respectively, for the three days above: On Day 1, since the index rose 1%, FAS would seek to provide 3x that return. So the $10,000 investment would rise to $10,300. Because the index rose 1%, the fund's debt-to-equity would be 299% rather than the target of 300%. The fund would need to be reset (rebalanced) because the value of the underlying increased by 1% while debt remained the same (ignoring any fees and interest for simplicity). The fund would borrow more funds or buy more stocks (or both) to bring the leverage back to 300%. But on Day 2, the index fell 2.0%. So, FAS would target returns of 3 x -2% = -6%. The $10,300 balance would decline by 6% to $9,682. However, because the value of the fund's stocks fell, it would be out of balance at 302% without resetting at the end of the day. Thus, it would need to sell stocks, repay debt, or do both to balance its debt-to-equity ratio. On Day 3, the index rose 0.5%, so FAS would attempt to return 3 x 0.5% = 1.5%. So, the balance moves from $9,682 to $9,827, a net loss of 1.73%. The fund would reset its balances appropriately at the end of the day. While the index declined 0.5% over the three days (a three-day loss of -1.5%), the 3x LETF declined more than 1.7% over the same period because of the effects of daily rebalancing. Thus, LETF returns can significantly diverge from a simple multiplier of the underlying index's returns in volatile conditions over those same periods. The sequence of daily gains and losses matters because of the daily reset mechanism. So, while useful for very short-term trading strategies, LETFs like FAS generally should not be expected to achieve a consistent 3x return compared with the tracked index or assets for longer periods. It depends on whether you enjoy trading and can tolerate the increased risk of loss that leveraged ETFs can cause. Leveraged ETFs can increase gains, but they can also increase losses compared to the underlying assets. A 3x leveraged ETF attempts to increase an index's returns by 300% by maintaining a specific debt-to-equity ratio within the fund. When the underlying's price increases, the fund amplifies the returns. When it decreases, it amplifies the losses. Leverage Shares has several 5x leveraged exchange traded products: 5x U.S. 500, 5x 20+ Year Treasury Bond, 5x 7-10 Year Treasury Bond, 5x TIPS, 5x Magnificent 7, -5x 20+ Year Treasury Bond, -5x 7-10 Year Treasury Bond, and -5x TIPS. LETFs are specialized financial instruments designed to deliver multiples of the daily performance of a specific index or asset. They achieve this by using derivatives as leverage, amplifying both gains and losses. Ideal for experienced traders and suited for short-term (i.e., intraday) trading strategies, LETFs are used in scenarios when quick, significant market moves are expected. However, their complex nature and the impact of daily rebalancing make them unsuitable for longer-term investments. Investors should use caution, as these ETFs entail higher risk and volatility than traditional ETFs. Because of their sensitivity to market fluctuations and the costs associated with their operation, LETFs should be used with a clear understanding of their mechanisms and potential impacts on investment portfolios.

            "title": "How Are ETF Fees Deducted?",
            "content": "Investment management fees for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are deducted by the ETF or fund company and adjustments are made to the net asset value (NAV) of the fund daily. Investors don't see these fees on their statements because the fund company handles them in-house. Management fees are just a component of the total management expense ratio (MER), which is what should concern investors. An ETF company incurs expenses ranging from manager salaries to custodial services and marketing costs as part of its normal operations. They're subtracted from the NAV. Assume an ETF has a stated annual expense ratio of 0.75%. The expected expense to be paid over the year is $375 on an investment of $50,000. The investor would slowly see their $50,000 move to a value of $49,625 over the year if the ETF returned precisely 0% for the year. The net return the investor receives from the ETF is based on the total return the fund earned minus the stated expense ratio. The NAV would increase by 14.25% if the ETF returns 15%. This is the total return minus the expense ratio. Fees are important because they can have a huge impact on your ultimate returns. A $100 investment that grows by 7% a year would be worth $197 in 10 years without fees. Subtract a 1% annual fee and the result is $179. Fund expenses have eaten up approximately 10% of your potential portfolio. Fees compound over time just as portfolio assets do so the longer the investing period, the bigger the loss. Some funds are more expensive than others. A critical distinction is passive versus active management. Passive managers simply mimic the holdings of a stock index, often the S&P 500, sometimes with minor deviations. These \"index fund\" or \"index ETF\" managers periodically rebalance fund assets to match the benchmark index. This incurs trading costs but they're usually minimal. As the name suggests, active managers take a greater hand in choosing fund assets. This requires expensive research departments that passive funds don't have and usually a higher level of trading that elevates transaction costs. All this is reflected in the MER. The asset-weighted average expense ratio dropped from 0.61% in 2021 to 0.59% in 2022, the last full year for which statistics are available. Expense ratios for passive funds declined from 0.13% in 2021 to 0.12% in 2022. Morningstar estimates investors saved $9.8 billion in fund expenses in 2022, the last full year for which statistics are available. Investors are benefitting from less expensive fund options as competition between fund companies increases. Companies are moving toward fee-based compensation models and away from traditional transaction-based models, according to Morningstar. Customer rejection of costly funds is evident in net inflows and outflows. The cheapest 20% of funds saw inflows of $394 billion in 2022. The remaining 80% saw outflows of $734 billion. The popularity of low-cost robo-advisors is another factor driving down the cost of wealth management services and putting pressure on fund companies to keep expense ratios low. Many investors are responding favorably to the rapid digitalization in investment services and the ability to build high-quality portfolios for a minimal cost using easily accessible online platforms. The worldwide robo-advisory market is expected to be valued at $129.5 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32.5% between 2023 and 2032. Passively managed funds like index ETFs tend to have lower fees than actively managed mutual funds. Broad-based funds tend to have lower expenses than narrowly-based funds because their management costs are distributed among a larger investor base. Vanguard claimed the lowest expense ratio among all fund managers in 2022 with average asset-weighted expenses of 0.08%. Brokerage houses may charge a commission for ETF trades just as they charge for any other market-traded security. These fees are typically around $20 per trade or less but they can add up over time if the investor trades ETFs often. The average asset-weighted expense ratio for passively managed funds was around 0.37% in 2022, according to research by Morningstar. Investors should expect to pay around $3.70 for management costs for every $1,000 of investment value. ETF fees pay for the expenses of managing an exchange-traded fund. They include custodial costs, management salaries, and the costs of buying and selling securities. These are typically lower than the expenses for actively managed funds but they can be significant if you trade often or if the fund does poorly. These costs are automatically deducted from the fund's assets and they're reported in the fund's annual statements.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were launched in 1993 with the first U.S. fund, Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts, better known as spiders (SPDRs). This first ETF tracked the S&P 500 and its popularity with investors led to the introduction of ETFs available through brokers based on other indexes, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq 100. Cavan Images / Getty Images As of Nov. 2023, over 3,000 ETFs were listed on U.S. exchanges with combined assets exceeding $7.6 trillion. ETFs range from traditional index ETFs based on U.S. and international equity indexes and subindexes, and others that track benchmark indices in bonds, commodities, and futures. There are ETFs based on investing style and those that focus on market capitalization. Leveraged ETFs provide returns or losses based on the underlying index's movements, as well as inverse ETFs that rise when the market falls and vice-versa. Investors can narrow their choices using an asset screener typically available on brokerage trading platforms for free or through subscription-based services. Read about Investopedia's 10 Rules of Investing by picking up a copy of our special issue print edition. Funds that track the S&P 500 index include SPDR (SPY), Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, or iShares S&P 500 ETF. Some ETF issuers have developed products with a specific focus. The Range Cancer Therapeutics ETF (CNCR) tracks the Range Cancer Therapeutics Index and invests in stocks that focus on the research and development of drugs and technology to fight\u00a0cancer using immunotherapy. ETFs based on new investment trends include the Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) or the Drone Economy Strategy ETF (IFLY). The Obesity ETF invests in companies developing ways to fight obesity and related diseases. In January 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved eleven new spot bitcoin ETFs listed on the NYSE Arca, Cboe BZX, and Nasdaq exchanges.\u00a0On May 23, 2024, the SEC approved an application from the same three US exchanges to list spot ether ETFs. The SEC later gave permission to several issuers to launch spot ether ETFs, which began trading on U.S. exchanges in July 2024. Given the number of ETF choices that investors have, it's important to consider the following factors: When the ETF shares are sold and if the ETF was held in a taxable account, the investor will owe taxes on any capital gains. A bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept.  The ETF issuer will notify investors when the ETF will stop trading. The investor has to decide on the best course of action to protect the investment and determine whether to sell the ETF shares before the \"stop trading\" date or hold on to the ETF shares until liquidation.  When selecting an ETF, investors should consider factors such as its level of assets, trading volume, and underlying index. In the event that an ETF is to be liquidated, an investor has to decide whether to sell the ETF shares before it stops trading or wait until the liquidation process is completed, with due consideration given to the tax aspects of the ETF sale.

            "title": "Target-Date Funds: Advantages and Disadvantages",
            "content": "Should you pick a target-date fund (or something else) for retirement? Target-date funds are a popular choice among investors for retirement savings, but like any investment they have pros and cons that need to be considered. Target retirement funds are designed to be the only investment vehicle that an investor uses to save for retirement. Also referred to as life-cycle funds or age-based funds, the concept is simple: Pick a fund, put as much as you can into the fund, then forget about it until you reach retirement age. Of course, nothing is ever as simple as it seems. While simplicity is one of the pros of these funds, investors still need to stay on top of fees, asset allocation, and the potential risks. There are two types of target-date funds from which you can choose: target date and target risk. A target-date fund operates under an asset allocation formula that assumes you will retire in a certain year and adjusts its asset allocation model as it gets closer to that year. The target year is identified in the name of the fund. So, for instance, if you plan to retire in or near 2045, you would pick a fund with 2045 in its name. With target-risk funds, you generally have three groups from which to choose. Each group is based on your risk tolerance, whether you are a conservative, aggressive, or moderate risk-taker. If you decide later that your risk tolerance has or needs to change as you get closer to retirement, you have the option of switching to a different risk level. Target retirement funds offer something for everyone. You can find funds that feature active management, passive management, exposure to a variety of markets, and a selection of asset allocation options are all available. Investors who are comfortable designating a percentage of their retirement, then forgetting about it for 30 years may be completely comfortable with target retirement funds. In addition, investors who do not mind doing a little research might find the exact fund they are looking for in the target fund lineup. Just because the fund says 2045 on the label does not mean that a raging bull market will start and end just in time to keep the fund at the top of its game\u2014nor does it mean that a severe bear market will not hit in 2044 and decimate the fund's holdings. There are several disadvantages that investors need to consider, including: The first challenge with target-date funds is that all funds are not created equal. A sample of approximate holdings (as of Aug. 31, 2020) with a target date of 2045 demonstrates this point. While each of these funds claims to be a good choice for investors seeking to retire in 2045, the contents of the funds are different. Keep in mind that this proportion may vary even more over time. That variance can be of particular concern to retirees. One retiree may have enough money on hand to invest strictly in bonds and other fixed-income securities. Another, requiring both growth and income, may need an equity component to keep the portfolio on track. A fund that meets the needs of one of these investors is unlikely to meet the needs of the other. Beyond holdings, the funds also differ in terms of investment style. For instance, depending on what you are looking for, you can find a fund that is is made up entirely of index funds. Based on algorithms, such a fund is likely to have lower fees (see below). But investors who prefer active management, with actual human beings tracking market trends and making choices would need to shop elsewhere. Finding a fund with the right date is just the beginning of the decision process. Funds also differ in terms of expenses. Since each is a fund of funds, the portfolio you buy into consists of multiple underlying mutual funds, each of which has an expense ratio. Depending on how the fund family calculates fees, those expenses can add up quickly. For instance, one fund company may charge 0.21% of assets under management while another may charge twice or even three times that amount. As such, expenses must be a point of consideration when choosing these funds. Beyond expenses, another consideration is that each of the underlying funds in a target portfolio is offered by the same fund company. Every target fund in Vanguard's lineup has nothing but other Vanguard funds inside the portfolio. The same goes for the Fidelity and T. Rowe funds. In an era with more than a few corporate scandals on record, you are trusting all of your assets to a single-fund family. Choosing a fund is one thing, but correctly implementing your retirement savings strategy is another thing altogether. Investors who have their assets in a target retirement fund need to be aware of how other retirement investments could skew their asset allocation. For example, if a target fund has an 80% stock and a 20% bond asset allocation, but the investor purchases a certificate of deposit with 10% of their retirement assets, this effectively decreases the stock allocation of the investor's overall portfolio and increases the bond allocation. Even investors who use the funds as their sole retirement investment vehicle need to pay attention to the overall asset allocation because this allocation changes as the target date nears. Generally, funds are designed to move to a more conservative funding position to preserve assets as the investor gets closer to the target date. If retirement is fast approaching but the balance in the investor's account isn't enough to meet their retirement needs, this allocation change will leave the investor with a fund that may have no hope of providing the type of returns required to keep those retirement plans on track. Similar concerns emerge once retirement age is reached. While many investors view these funds as being designed to provide for retirement on or around a certain date, assets can be left in the fund after retirement. Here again, the size of the nest egg may indicate that a conservative strategy is not enough to keep the bills paid and the lights on. Last but not least, reaching retirement by the chosen date is not just a function of choosing a fund and putting all of your money into that fund, it is also about putting the right amount of money into that fund. Regardless of the chosen date, an under-funded nest egg will simply not support a financially secure retirement."

            "title": "How to Choose an S&P 500 ETF",
            "content": "What every investor should know when investing in ETFs that mirror the S&P 500 Witthaya Prasongsin / Getty Images The S&P 500 Index is considered a fairly accurate snapshot of the U.S. economy since it measures the market capitalization of the nation's 500 largest corporations. In fact, the very first exchange-traded fund (ETF) created used the S&P 500 as its benchmark. ETFs are easy to buy through the best brokers and trading platforms. State Street Global Advisors introduced the Standard & Poor\u2019s Depositary Receipt, better known by its arachnoid acronym, SPDR (\"spider\"), and traded under the symbol SPY in 1993. It is the oldest ETF out there and remains one of the largest by any measure. SPY has more than $400 billion in assets under management as of late August 2023. It also spawned a whole family of State Street ETFs known as SPDR funds, each of which focuses on a particular geographic region or market sector. But SPY has got plenty of competition for new money from investors. The S&P 500 Index is, by definition, the benchmark for any S&P 500 ETF. That means the financial institution that manages the ETF buys stock in every company listed in the index, using the same weighting that the index uses. The investor's money will rise or fall with the S&P 500. It's trickier than it sounds. The ETF manager must buy or sell a dozen or so individual stocks every year to keep up with changes in that underlying index. Some of the stocks disappear as companies get bought out, and some lose their listing on the S&P 500 by failing to meet its stringent criteria. When that happens, the ETF sponsor sells off the outgoing index component, or at least removes it from the index holdings, and replaces it with the new listing selected for the S&P 500 Index. The result is an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 close to perfection. The S&P 500 ETF from State Street was the first ETF but by no means the last to track the S&P 500 Index. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), introduced by Vanguard in 2010, has more than $304 billion in assets under management as of late-August 2023. The iShares' Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) from BlackRock has $343 billion in assets under management as of late-August 2023. These three players dominate the market for S&P 500 Index funds. That's a lot of money invested in the S&P 500 but there are reasons: ETFs in general are a cost-effective way to get exposure to a number of stocks. And, the S&P 500 Index as a benchmark offers instant diversification as it covers a wide range of industries and the biggest companies in every one of them. All of the above should mean that an S&P ETF is as good as any other. But as almost anyone who has built a fortune knows, you accumulate wealth by spending less of it. That brings us to the expense ratio. As with any investment, profit is proceeds minus expenses. And although ETFs have become popular because of their relatively low fees, there are differences among them that can add up. State Street charges an expense ratio of 0.0945% for its SPY, which is more than triple Vanguard VOO's expense ratio of 0.03%. BlackRock's IVV also has an expense ratio of 0.03%. That would seem to simplify the question of which S&P 500 ETF you should buy. Gaining exposure to the S&P 500 is a great way to diversify your investments since the index consists of 500 companies from a multitude of sectors. It's not quite that simple. Whether it\u2019s by virtue of their size or some other factor, SPDR shares are by far the most heavily traded of any S&P 500 ETF. They trade dozens of times as frequently as do Vanguard or iShares S&P 500 ETF shares, making it easy for a prospective seller to convert their holdings to cash. Then again, a thinly traded S&P 500 ETF still trades close to a million shares a day. You might have to wait a few hours rather than a few minutes. Unless you have a pressing reason, there's little reason to shift your money out of iShares and into SPDR. Moreover, even a 0.0945% expense ratio is vanishingly low. It\u2019s easy to find mutual funds with expense ratios 20 times that number. Granted, they offer funds that require active management, as opposed to just buying the stocks in a benchmark index. Another difference between State Street's SPDR, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, and the iShares' Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) from BlackRock is something of a technicality. SPDR is a unit investment trust. It was the first ETF to be introduced and is still bound by an antiquated legal structure that didn\u2019t foresee the creation of myriad ETFs. State Street must keep all the shares it purchases in-house. Vanguard and State Street are set up differently and are allowed to lend their shares to other firms and earn concomitant interest. Like investors in any ETF that includes dividend stocks, investors in S&P 500 ETFs receive dividends. Each fund has to pay out dividends to shareholders, but there are some other options as well. The first is its liquidity. While S&P 500 ETFs would be considered very liquid by their nature, some might have more daily trading volume and tighter bid-ask spreads than others. A second consideration would be the index's tracking error. Not all index ETFs precisely replicate the index. With more than 500 stocks to own, an S&P 500 index ETF may instead choose to hold only the most important or heavily-weighted stocks in the index. This can result in the ETF returning slightly differently from the benchmark index. ETFs that do not fully replicate an index may also have a slightly different dividend yield than that of the index itself for the same reason. Investors may also want to consider an ETF's inception date to see how long it has been around. While a newer ETF does not necessarily make it worse, it will have less of a track record and less historical data with which to compare its actual performance. Today, there are a large number of S&P 500 ETFs to choose from in addition to the ones highlighted here. Here are a few of the most popular S&P 500 ETFs: State Street Global Advisors introduced the Standard & Poor\u2019s Depositary Receipt, better known by the acronym SPDR, in 1993. It was not only the oldest S&P 500 ETF, it is the oldest ETF. It trades under the symbol SPY. SPY got a rough start. It had just $6.53 million in assets when it began. After some initial difficulty finding investors, it soared to more than $1 billion in\u00a0assets under management (AUM) in just three years. As of August 2023, this ETF trust has grown to more than $408 billion in assets. Both an index ETF and an index mutual fund passively track the S&P 500 index in order to duplicate its return. ETFs trade like stocks on exchanges, while mutual funds can only be traded at the end of each trading day. This makes ETFs more liquid and more accessible to ordinary investors. ETFs tend to have lower fees although index mutual fund fees have come down dramatically due to the competition from ETFs. An S&P 500 Index ETF is a good choice for an investor who wants the equivalent of a diverse portfolio but can't or won't directly buy the stocks of every one of the 500 biggest large-cap U.S. companies. Its risk level is moderate. You could, for example, take on a lot more risk by dabbling in an ETF that tracks cryptocurrency stocks or oil exploration stocks. You're also putting your money into well-established companies, with a relatively slight risk of a severe and long-term downturn. Since they track the S&P 500 index, they can be a suitable choice for investors seeking passive index investing. The index is meant to reflect the state of the market as a whole, so its component stocks cover the field from Coca-Cola and Microsoft to Merck and Walmart Inc. No. \"Exchange-traded fund (ETF)\" is the broad name for a kind of security that pools investors' money to buy a number of individual stocks or other assets. The main difference between an ETF and a mutual fund is that an ETF is traded on an exchange, like a stock. The best-known ETFs by far are passively-managed funds that are benchmarked to a specific index such as the S&P 500 Index. Some ETFs are actively managed. For those who reject the concept of beating the market, or the work entailed to do it, investing in an S&P 500 ETF makes sense. Be patient and you\u2019ll track the market note-for-note. Best of all, the investment firms have already performed the task of purchasing the proper amounts of each component of the S&P 500, bundling them into a unit, and making them available in small enough slivers that anyone who wants a piece can buy one. For the modest expense ratio, that\u2019s an excellent bargain.

SOPA Images\u00a0/ Getty Images After the January 2024 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC\u2019s) approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) spurred a massive rally in the digital currency, interest in a proposed spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) surged along with the prices of these two major cryptocurrencies. The SEC, which initially scuttled some 20 spot bitcoin ETF proposals between 2018 and 2023, had shown itself to be more hesitant in approving similar funds for ether, the cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum blockchain system. However, in a surprise move in May 2024, the SEC permitted Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the NYSE to list ETFs holding ether. Nine spot ether ETFs began trading on those exchanges in July 2024. The SEC's decision came as a significant surprise win for the ETF issuers and the cryptocurrency industry, which until just days before had expected the SEC to reject the filings. The decision marked a significant step toward getting these products to market. \"The approval of ETH ETFs is transformative, allowing investors who are not comfortable investing directly on-chain to capitalize on Ethereum's growing utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) and strong market presence,\" Christina Lynn, a behavioral finance researcher and certified financial planner at Mariner Wealth Advisors, told Investopedia. \"Although ETH ETFs may not see the same immediate demand as BTC ETFs, they offer valuable diversification and are expected to attract substantial investment inflows.\" Not everyone is pleased with the development. \"Ether is an extremely volatile asset, and the Ethereum network itself has features that make it vulnerable to fraud and manipulation,\" said Benjamin Schiffrin, director of securities policy at the Washington D.C.-based policy group Better Markets. \"By approving the applications to list and trade spot ether ETPs, the SEC failed to live up to its mission to protect investors and the markets.\u201d However, Lynn argues there is value to be had in crypto, though she counsels a measured approach. Investors \"should approach crypto investing with a long-term perspective. A buy-and-hold strategy is superior for the average investor compared to day trading,\" Lynn said. Anyone investing in crypto ETFs, she added, \"should abandon get-rich-quick schemes and aim for above-average return on investment.\" She said that about 2% to 5% of a portfolio for the more prepared and risk-tolerant investors could be advisable. Overall, the cryptocurrency market sees this development and other recent positive regulatory moves in the U.S. and abroad as strong tailwinds in its efforts to further integrate with mainstream finance. Launching spot ether ETFs could attract significant investor inflows, given the $30 billion poured into crypto ETFs in 2024 following the earlier bitcoin ETF approvals. Spot ether ETFs were not approved for trading in the U.S. until July 2024, when the SEC officially approved nine spot ether ETFs for trading on U.S. exchanges. The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, such as the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and the Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (BTF), was significant for the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. These ETFs have had rapid inflows and strong investor demand, suggesting an appetite for regulated, easily accessible exposure to cryptocurrencies. Proponents of cryptocurrencies argue that early price increases in spot bitcoin ETFs bolstered the case for spot ether ETFs. They believe that investors are seeking diversification through exposure to ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. For them, Ethereum\u2019s thriving ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts makes it an attractive investment, even before considering the value of its real-world applications as it gains wider acceptance. However, critics are still cautious about the rush to embrace spot ether ETFs. They argue that the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies makes them unsuitable for many investors. Concerns about regulatory uncertainty, potential market manipulation, and the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining (even if mitigated by Ethereum\u2019s model) are all cited as reasons for caution. Skeptics worry that the push for ETFs might be driven more by the financial industry\u2019s interest in new products than by a genuine need for investor access to cryptocurrencies. Spot ether ETFs hold ether tokens in their portfolios. Their objective is to track the price of ether as closely as possible, providing investors with direct exposure to the cryptocurrency without the need to purchase and store it themselves. Spot ether ETFs offer a more straightforward and transparent approach than ETFs that invest in derivatives or a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies, such as ether futures ETFs. A spot ether ETF involves \u201ccreation and redemption,\u201d just like other ETFs. Authorized participants, typically large institutional investors, play a crucial role in this process. To create new shares of the ETF, authorized participants deposit a corresponding amount of ether with the ETF issuer. In exchange, they receive newly minted shares of the ETF. Conversely, when authorized participants want to redeem shares of the ETF, they return the shares to the issuer and receive an equal amount of ether in return. This keeps an ETF\u2019s price in line with the value of the underlying ether. As demand for the ETF shares increases, authorized participants can create more shares by depositing additional ether. Similarly, they can redeem shares and receive ether back if demand decreases. Investors can buy and sell shares of spot ether ETFs on stock exchanges throughout the trading day, as they do with any other ETF or stock. This makes the cryptocurrency fund easy to trade and likely gives it abundant liquidity, enabling investors to enter or exit positions throughout the trading day without interacting directly with cryptocurrency exchanges. When considering spot ether ETFs, Lynn offers these prudent pieces of advice: Lynn notes that while Ethereum ETFs may not see the same immediate demand as bitcoin ETFs, they offer valuable prospects for diversification. Ethereum's role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and its versatility as a technology platform make it an attractive investment option, she said. How do you decide among similar-looking spot ether ETFs? Lynn said to review the following: \"The simplest way to choose an ETH ETF is to opt for the product with the lowest fees, as this helps maximize returns by minimizing costs,\" Lynn said. That's \"a principle that applies equally to both traditional and crypto ETFs.\" A spot ether ETF could offer these potential advantages for investors: Investors should also be aware of the risks associated with these investments: Hold actual cryptocurrencies Track the price of the crypto very closely Can be more cost-effective than futures Have more significant regulatory burdens than futures Are subject to custody risks Invest in crypto futures contracts Have less efficient tracking of the price of the underlying crypto Don\u2019t have regulatory or custody risks Carry higher management costs Investors have two main options for crypto-based exchange-traded funds: spot ETFs and futures-based ETFs. While both types aim to provide exposure to the price movement of an underlying crypto-asset, they differ in how they do this. Spot ETFs hold actual crypto tokens in their underlying portfolios and are designed to track the price as closely as possible\u2014offering investors direct exposure to the cryptocurrency. When investors buy shares in a spot ETF, they own a portion of the fund\u2019s crypto holdings. Meanwhile, futures-based ETFs invest in crypto futures contracts rather than hold the cryptocurrency directly. Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a preset price on a specific future date. These ETFs track the price of crypto-assets by rolling over futures contracts as they approach expiration. While spot crypto ETFs should be more cost-effective and provide more direct access than their futures-based alternatives, they have more significant regulatory burdens and are subject to custody risks (e.g., the ETF provider gets hacked or loses their private keys). Futures-based ETFs don\u2019t have the same regulatory or custody risks, but they typically have tracking errors between the ETF price and the underlying asset and carry higher management fees because of the active trading of futures contracts. While ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has often been overshadowed by bitcoin, it has potential applications that could make it attractive to investors. Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts and dApps. Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum has grown into the most prominent platform for various blockchain-based applications and services. Ethereum grew due to the demand for non-fungible tokens, tokenized equity, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH). Because of network effects, as more developers and users adopted Ethereum\u2014the cryptocurrency has outlasted many others launched at about the same time\u2014the platform has attracted even more participants. However, investing in ether has risks. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and the price of ETH can fluctuate significantly over short periods. In addition, Ethereum faces questions about its scalability and has high transaction fees. Transaction costs have risen as the network has become more congested, which could impact its adoption. The Ethereum community has tried to solve some of these issues, most prominently through its September 2022 \u201cmerge,\u201d which was its shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Under its previous proof-of-work (PoW) system, which bitcoin still relies upon, powerful computers compete to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add new blocks to the Ethereum system. Known as mining, this work requires significant computational power and consumes an enormous amount of energy. By contrast, the PoS relies on users staking their ether\u2014that is, locking up a part of their ETH as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks. The more ether that a user stakes, the better their chances of being selected to validate transactions and earn rewards. Ethereum has reported changes to this model have led to a 99.988% cut in energy usage. PoS is also designed to improve network security by making it more costly for attackers to gain control of the network. Ethereum also introduced sharding to reduce latency. Ethereum operates on a blockchain, a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across a network of computers. The Ethereum blockchain is powered by its native cryptocurrency token, ether, which serves as payment for transaction fees and computational services within the network. One of Ethereum\u2019s key features is its support for smart contracts. These are self-executing agreements with their terms directly written into code. They automatically enforce the rules and penalties surrounding an agreement, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the risk of fraud or manipulation. \"While Ethereum and Bitcoin are both significant in the blockchain space, they serve different purposes,\" Lynn said. \"Bitcoin is primarily a store of value, while Ethereum is a versatile technology platform.\" Here are the important differences for investors to note: Investors can purchase ETH on cryptocurrency exchanges and hold it in a digital wallet. This approach offers direct ownership of the cryptocurrency but also involves securely storing and managing the private keys. While now easier to use and more robust in terms of security, crypto exchanges still face challenges such as lack of regulatory oversight, the threat of hacks and theft, and the potential for bad actors to scam users. Alternatively, investing in spot ether ETFs offers a more accessible and regulated route. ETFs provide investors with exposure to the price movement of ETH without needing to hold the cryptocurrency directly. Investors can forgo futures-based ETFs and trade ether derivatives themselves, such as futures and options contracts, on a cryptocurrency exchange. These instruments allow for leveraged trading and can be used for hedging or speculative purposes. However, trading derivatives on one\u2019s own comes with many risks and complexities. These contracts are often highly leveraged and may not be fully regulated. Liquidity is another factor to consider when trading ether derivatives. While major exchanges generally offer enough liquidity for ether futures and options, the market depth may be lower than ETF or spot trading. This can lead to wider bid-ask spreads and challenges in executing large trades. The prospects of spot ether ETFs are tied to regulatory developments and the overall acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. In May 2024, the SEC approved applications from Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE to list spot ETFs tied to the price of ether. In July 2024, the SEC approved applications from ETF issuers and allowed spot ether ETFs to begin trading. One sticking point had been the practice of staking, where ether holders lock up their funds as collateral to support the operations of the Ethereum blockchain in exchange for rewards. The SEC has cracked down on staking in the past, fining cryptocurrency exchange Kraken and suing Coinbase over their staking offerings. The SEC is also concerned about protecting investors from potentially losing control of their tokens and taking on the risks associated with staking platforms. Adding staking amendments to ether ETF proposals by Fidelity and Grayscale further complicated an already difficult approval process. Cryptocurrency ETFs, including those focused on ether, are still relatively new and can have significantly more volatility than traditional assets. Spot crypto ETFs should only be a part of a well-diversified portfolio. Another issue has been whether the SEC will classify ether tokens as securities. If this occurs, the asset itself, not just ETFs whose value is tied to it, would fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC and be subject to many of the same securities laws and regulations as stocks. This could change how ether is traded, held, and taxed for investors. It could also impact the development and operation of dApps on Ethereum since these, too, might come under U.S. securities laws. While SEC Chair Gary Gensler and other regulators have been consistent crypto skeptics, the approval of several spot bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 set a precedent paving the way for ether ETFs. Spot ether ETFs should increase the liquidity of the ether market by providing more buyers and sellers. More liquidity can lead to more stable prices and less volatility, making ether more attractive to ordinary investors. ETF inflows may also increase the market price of ETH as fund providers will have to buy cryptocurrency in the open market, spiking demand, as occurred with bitcoin in January 2024. Unlike spot bitcoin ETFs, which do not pay dividends, spot ether ETFs might pay dividends from staking. However, this would depend on the specific structure and investment strategy of the ETF and any regulatory restrictions imposed on it. Staking is the holding and \u201clocking up\u201d of a certain amount of ether in a wallet to support the network\u2019s consensus mechanism and earn rewards in the form of newly minted ether. If a spot ether ETF engages in staking, it could generate income from these staking rewards. Yes. While direct cryptocurrency holdings are not allowed in qualified retirement accounts like individual retirement accounts, ETFs, including spot or futures-based ether ETFs, are permitted. Spot ether ETFs, which began trading in July 2024, offer investors a means of gaining exposure to the ETH cryptocurrency market through a regulated and accessible fund. By providing accessibility, simplicity, and regulatory oversight of the ETFs, these investments could attract a broader range of investors to the cryptocurrency market. Unlike futures-based ether ETFs, a spot ETF directly holds ETH tokens and is more cost-effective. However, as with any investment, it is crucial to understand the risks and considerations involved. By carefully evaluating the options available and staying informed about market developments, investors can make well-informed decisions when considering these and other ETFs as part of their investment strategy.

Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) primarily hold a type of U.S. government bond designed to protect investors from inflation. Treasury Inflation-Protected securities (TIPS) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) mainly hold U.S. government bonds designed to protect investors against inflation. The principal value of TIPS rises and falls based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). TIPS ETFs hold a portfolio of TIPS bonds with varying maturities. By investing in these ETFs, you gain exposure to the TIPS market in one security from an ETF that trades on the major stock exchanges. As inflation rises, the value of TIPS bonds increases, as does the net asset value (NAV) of the ETF. TIPS ETFs can be a good fixed-income option for investors to hedge inflation risk. They provide easy access to the benefits of TIPS with the convenience, diversification, and flexibility of ETFs. TIPS ETFs are constructed by buying and holding a basket of TIPS tracking a specific TIPS index, as with the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities Index. The index comprises TIPS with at least one year remaining until maturity and is weighted by the adjusted market capitalization of each bond. TIPS ETFs may use sampling techniques to replicate the index\u2019s performance or hold all the bonds in the index. A key feature of TIPS, first offered by the Treasury in the late 1990s, is that the principal value adjusts upward or downward in line with the Consumer Price Index, a standard measure of inflation. When inflation goes up, the principal value of TIPS increases. When inflation goes down, the principal decreases. These adjustments help TIPS maintain a real rate of return when factoring in inflation. For example, suppose an investor buys a $1,000 face-value TIPS with a coupon rate of 1.0%. The following year, inflation rises 3%, so the principal would adjust to about $1,030 to offset inflation. The interest payment would be based on the new inflated principal value: 1% of $1,030 = $10.30. TIPS also have a fixed coupon rate (i.e., interest payments), which are paid out semiannually. The coupon payments stay the same throughout the bond\u2019s life, while the principal value fluctuates according to the CPI. When TIPS mature, investors are paid back the inflation-adjusted principal or the original principal, whichever is higher. This provides downside protection against deflation. Unlike individual TIPS, where interest payments are made semiannually, TIPS ETFs typically distribute dividends to investors more frequently, often monthly. These dividends include interest payments from the underlying TIPS and any capital gains.\u00a0The TIPS ETF might not pay a monthly distribution if there is deflation. Here are some key benefits of investing in TIPS ETFs: While TIPS ETFs have many advantages, there are some potential downsides to consider: Understanding these tradeoffs can help investors decide if a TIPS ETF makes sense for their portfolio or if owning TIPS directly may be preferable. Consulting a financial advisor can help analyze the pros and cons. TIPS are designed to provide inflation protection by adjusting their principal value based on changes in the CPI. This adjustment helps their value maintain purchasing power as inflation rises. However, TIPS and TIPS ETFs may not fully offset high or sudden inflation. For example, the CPI measure might underestimate inflation, limiting their protection. The iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) was the first TIPS ETF, launched in 2003 by BlackRock Financial Management. It\u2019s the largest TIPS ETF in assets under management, with $18.7 billion as of early 2024. According to the VettaFi ETF Database, about 20 TIPS ETFs were trading in the United States in early 2024. These ETFs vary in duration, expense ratio, dividend yield, and performance. Popular TIPS ETFs include the Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities ETF (VTIP), the Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF (SCHP), and the PIMCO 15+ Year U.S. TIPS Index Fund (LTPZ). If you\u2019re considering a TIPS ETF, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll want to consider: TIPS can offer valuable long-term inflation protection, but they are not a perfect hedge. Historically, they have kept up with or outperformed the rate of inflation, especially over longer time horizons. Investors should use TIPS ETFs as part of a broadly diversified portfolio and have realistic expectations about their inflation-fighting abilities. Consulting with a financial advisor can help determine the right role for TIPS for you. Investing in TIPS ETFs is straightforward, as these trade like any other stock or ETF through your brokerage account. If you have such an account, simply research and identify the TIPS ETF you\u2019d like to trade and then do so like any other shares on your broker\u2019s platform. Inflation, interest rates, duration, and market conditions all influence TIPS ETF returns, which benefit from rising inflation as their principal and interest payments increase with the CPI. However, TIPS ETFs also suffer from rising interest rates, as their bond prices decrease as rates rise like other bonds. The duration of TIPS ETFs will also matter, as longer-duration TIPS ETFs have higher price sensitivity to interest rate changes. In contrast, shorter-duration TIPS ETFs often have lower returns but lower risks. TIPS ETFs generally tend to do well when inflation is high and interest rates are low, and vice versa. Also, pay attention to the expense ratios with these ETFs, as more costly ETFs will eat into your net returns more than lower-cost ones, all else being equal. The actual performance of a TIPS ETF will depend on several factors and the period considered. According to the VettaFi ETF Database, the best-performing TIPS ETF over the past five-year period has been the FlexShares iBoxx 3-Year Target Duration TIPS Index Fund (TDTT), with an average annualized return of 3.36% and the Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities ETF at 3.34%. These returns exceed the trailing five-year average annualized inflation rate of 2.25% during the same period. However, if you look at three-year trailing returns, the Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities ETF leads with 2.40%, followed by the iShares 0\u20135 Year TIPS Bond ETF (STIP) at 2.32%. TIPS ETFs can underperform the broader market during market downturns or economic recessions, especially when inflation is low or negative. TIPS ETFs benefit from rising inflation as their principal and interest payments increase with the CPI. However, when inflation is low or negative, TIPS ETFs can lose value as their principal and interest payments decrease with the CPI and interest rates fall. Traditional Treasurys, meanwhile, have a fixed nominal interest rate that does not depend on inflation. Therefore, when inflation is low or negative, traditional Treasurys or bond ETFs can offer higher returns than TIPS ETFs. TIPS ETFs act as an inflation hedge for investors. These ETFs trade like ordinary shares of stock and offer convenience to investors who can trade them from their brokerage platforms. They offer diversification, lower investment thresholds than directly purchasing TIPS from the Treasury, enhanced liquidity, and regular income streams. However, understanding the potential for tracking errors and their tax implications is essential for informed investment decisions. You can choose among several TIPS ETFs with different durations, expense ratios, and liquidity levels. Investing in TIPS ETFs, like any investment, involves risks, including market fluctuations and potential loss of principal. It\u2019s advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Investopedia / Michela Buttignol A spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment that exposes ordinary investors to Bitcoin's price moves. Spot Bitcoin ETFs give mainstream investors a regulated way to invest indirectly in Bitcoin through their brokerage accounts. While several countries have embraced both types of ETFs, U.S. regulators were initially hesitant due to issues of market manipulation and custodial risk. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in the United States on Jan. 10, 2024. Bitcoin futures ETFs were already trading on Cboe since 2021. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded products (ETPs) that hold Bitcoins in a secure digital vault, which registered custodians manage. This kind of ETF mirrors the price of Bitcoins in the crypto market. The ETF begins by purchasing Bitcoins from other holders or through authorized cryptocurrency exchanges. The tokens are then stored in a digital wallet, often using several layers of security, including cold or offline storage, which reduces risks like hacking. The ETF then issues shares corresponding to the number of Bitcoins it holds. These shares are available on traditional stock or exchanges, and prices generally reflect the currency's prevailing market price. Shares track the price of Bitcoin as closely as possible by rebalancing to match the performance of the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate. Buying a spot Bitcoin ETF or a spot Ether ETF is like buying shares in any other ETF or security. The market is kept liquid and efficient by market makers who continuously offer to buy and sell shares of the ETF. Their activity is crucial in maintaining a stable market, ensuring that investors can easily buy or sell shares of the ETF when needed. More broadly, spot Bitcoin ETFs can help create additional opportunities for institutional and retail investors to speculate on Bitcoin without the technical challenges of managing a cryptocurrency wallet or the security concerns of safeguarding private keys. Spot Bitcoin ETFs aren't the only ones U.S. regulators have approved. In May 2024, the SEC approved eight spot Ether ETFs for trade on the NYSE, Nasdaq, and CBOE BZX exchange. Bitcoin futures contracts have been tradeable on the Cboe exchange for some time, but traders could not speculate using Bitcoin ETF options. Options are contracts between investors that allow them to speculate on the prices of underlying assets. These contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell shares of the Bitcoin spot ETFs at a specified price and date. Bitcoin futures contracts require traders to settle the contract in cash, whereas Bitcoin ETF options allow them to purchase or sell shares of the ETF at specific prices and dates. In October 2024, the SEC approved the Cboe exchange to allow traders to trade spot Bitcoin ETF options on the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). The Commission also approved the New York Stock Exchange to allow options trading on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin futures ETFs, which are derivatives-based, differ in how they are structured and how much exposure they offer to Bitcoin\u2019s price changes. Most spot Bitcoin ETFs directly hold Bitcoins, but derivatives-based Bitcoin ETFs use financial instruments like futures contracts to replicate Bitcoin\u2019s prices. Spot Bitcoin ETFs thus have direct ownership of Bitcoins (but most use custodians like Coinbase to hold the keys). This exposure is more intuitive for investors, making spot Bitcoin ETFs more straightforward for those investing in Bitcoin. Spot Bitcoin ETFs can thus be more transparent since each share of the ETF corresponds to a specific number of Bitcoins held. By contrast, derivatives-based ETFs can be more opaque for investors, given that their value is derived indirectly from futures contracts, which can be influenced by various market factors beyond Bitcoin\u2019s spot price. Directly holds Bitcoins Easy to use Easier to buy and sell quickly Potential tax benefits Lower operational risks Remains a volatile asset class Risk of cyber theft from custodians Regulatory uncertainty Management fees Tracking error Below are the advantages that investors are thought to have from spot Bitcoin ETFs: Like all investment vehicles, spot Bitcoin ETFs are not without risk: Security is always a concern for cryptocurrencies, even when they are held by investment firms. Nearly all cryptocurrency ETFs contract exchanges or other enterprise-level custodians to hold their crypto in cold storage. These custodians also hold criminal insurance, which covers the ETF's holdings and, thus, value for investors. A spot Bitcoin ETF does not directly affect the price of Bitcoins, but it can indirectly affect their price in several ways: The SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, 2024. Until then, regulators were reluctant to approve any spot Bitcoin ETF applications, citing concerns over market manipulation, fraud, custody, and investor protection. All 11 ETFs began trading on Jan. 11, 2024, including Grayscale's. SEC Chair Gary Gensler released a warning along with the approval: While the SEC has approved spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, along with options for some, there is no way to tell whether the instruments will continue to successfully trade in the future. Only time will tell. Which spot Bitcoin ETF is best depends on your preferences, the difference in fees they charge, and how comfortable you are investing in Bitcoin or Bitcoin funds. Bitcoin spot ETFs are available through exchanges and the brokerages that offer them. Some of the Bitcoin ETF tickers are IBIT, GBTC, FBTC, ARKB, BITB, BTC, and HODL. Spot Bitcoin ETFs represent a significant evolution in cryptocurrency, offering a regulated and simplified way to gain exposure to Bitcoin\u2019s prices. By potentially enhancing market liquidity, aiding in better price discovery, and attracting more institutional participation, spot Bitcoin ETFs could play a pivotal role in stabilizing and boosting Bitcoin adoption. However, the ripple effects of increased demand and speculative trading could also lead to worries about the market overvaluating the currency.

            "title": "Why Are My Bond ETFs Losing Money, and What Should I Do?",
            "content": "Bond ETF values drop when interest rates rise Michael Bromberg is a finance editor with a decade of experience. He is an expert at elucidating complex financial topics in clear, concise language. Michael received a Bachelor of Arts in literature from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a master's in linguistics from the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellin, Colombia. Interest rate changes are the primary culprit when bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) lose value. As interest rates rise, the prices of existing bonds fall, which impacts the value of the ETFs holding these assets. If your bond ETF loses value, you can wait out the interest rate changes or reallocate to money market accounts (MMAs), certificates of deposit (CDs), or high-yield savings accounts. Here's more on why bond ETFs drop in value and some considerations for avoiding any negative effects on your portfolio. When you buy an individual bond, you do so with the understanding that the principal will be repaid in full when the bond reaches maturity. Bond ETFs, however, hold assets with different maturity dates and buy and sell bonds as they expire or no longer match the age range that the fund targets. This means that bond ETFs do not have the same principal repayment guarantee as individual bonds. Fluctuations in the prices of bond ETFs often stem from the inverse relationship between the bond market and interest rates. Bond prices and yields moving in the opposite direction may seem counterintuitive, but the equation is simple enough. When prevailing interest rates rise, the fixed rate paid by an existing bond becomes less attractive, lowering its price. Conversely, falling interest rates make an existing bond\u2019s payouts more attractive, boosting its price. Since bond ETFs own a basket of fixed-income investments, they are not immune to interest rate risk. Increasing interest rates put downward pressure on the prices of bond ETFs, which can exasperate investors who turned to these assets, hoping to preserve their capital while generating a stream of income. The Federal Reserve\u2019s sustained campaign of interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 negatively affected the price performance of bond ETFs. If you own shares of a bond ETF, you might have a sinking feeling seeing the market value of your investment dip as interest rates increase. However, it\u2019s worth noting that rising interest rates can\u2019t last forever, and bond ETF prices are likely to recover once rates go lower. While the ability to trade shares in them easily is part of what makes bond ETFs attractive, you may want to avoid selling these assets at a depleted price. If you can wait for a different stage of the interest rate cycle, you might see a recovery in the prices of bonds and the ETFs that hold them. Similarly, when higher interest rates lower share prices in bond ETFs, the market typically presents other income-generating opportunities. Lower bond ETF prices may coincide with higher yields on cash investments such as money market accounts (MMAs), certificates of deposit (CDs), and high-yield savings accounts. A decrease in bond ETF prices is not a reason to sell in a panic, and it could be an opportunity to assess how your strategy matches up with the present economic cycle. The relative attractiveness of bond ETFs and other investments shifts in response to changing conditions, and it\u2019s up to you to ensure that you\u2019re maximizing your yield while taking on an acceptable level of risk. A bond ETF is a pooled investment security tied to a portfolio of bonds. Bond ETFs expose investors to various fixed-income assets with a specified holding period and strategy, such as investing in U.S. Treasurys or high-yield corporate bonds. Like other ETFs, bond ETFs trade throughout the day on the major stock exchanges. Trading on a centralized exchange makes bond ETFs significantly more liquid than individual bonds, which must be bought from a bond broker or through bond mutual funds, and they change hands only once daily. This flexibility can be helpful when turmoil hits the bond market, since you can trade bond ETFs even when the fixed-income markets experience distress. As a bond ETF investor, you get income through regular (usually monthly) dividend payouts. Bond ETFs also pay any capital gains as an annual dividend. Although these capital gains payouts may increase your tax bill, the effect is generally minimal, as bond returns don\u2019t generate capital gains in the same way as stock investments. For bonds, yield refers to the percentage return that an investor should expect to make. In technical terms, a bond\u2019s yield is the relationship between its coupon\u2014or the interest it pays out\u2014and its current market value. When a bond\u2019s price goes down, its yield goes up, while a drop in yield means higher bond prices. While the yield of an individual bond is relatively straightforward, bond ETFs are more complex. Since these investments represent a portfolio of many different bonds, it can be difficult to understand a bond ETF\u2019s overall yield. But there are some approaches to doing so. One common measure is the average yield to maturity: Take the weighted average yield of the bonds in the portfolio, and assume that the assets are held until maturity. However, this might not align with the practices of particular bond ETFs, which often sell bonds before they mature, and it doesn\u2019t account for the expenses charged by the ETF. Other alternatives include determining a bond ETF\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 30-day yield and representing the dividend and interest payouts over the past month after subtracting expenses. You can also calculate a bond ETF\u2019s yield by dividing recent distributions over its net asset value, or you can look at the 12-month yield to quantify an ETF\u2019s real-world behavior for the past year. These measures frequently give you different results, so it could be useful to consider several of them together when looking at the yield of a bond ETF, especially if you\u2019re using these calculations to compare funds and make investment decisions. The yield you can expect to earn from a bond ETF depends on the type of bonds in the fund\u2019s portfolio. Corporate bonds tend to pay higher yields because they present greater risk, while yields are lower for less risky government bonds. Conventional wisdom holds that your investment strategy should become more conservative as you approach retirement or another important goal. In many cases, this means shifting more of a portfolio to bonds, which can offer a steady income stream and potentially less risk than stocks. When you buy an individual bond, it stipulates that the principal will be repaid at maturity, and you can design your bond purchases to mature at set intervals for income. You might be drawn to ETFs that invest in bonds because bonds are generally safer investments. However, bond ETFs never mature\u2014the ETF holdings must be adjusted to try and meet the fund's goals. Active management exposes your initial investment to greater levels of risk. Moreover, rising interest rates hurt the price of bond ETFs, with prices of the underlying (existing) bonds dipping as yields increase. If prices stay down, you may never recover your principal by the time you had planned to. Like all investments, bond ETFs have their pros and cons. Tradable on stock exchanges and accessible to retail investors, bond ETFs represent an easy way to invest in a diversified portfolio in a general or specific bond market segment. However, it\u2019s important to check the expense ratio of bond ETFs. In addition, rising interest rates can send bond ETF prices lower, exposing investors to losses. Investors may benefit from holding bond ETFs longer to wait out such dips. Bond are used by many to preserve capital and create a source of income. Bond ETFs, during prolonged periods of rising rates, might cause you to lose a significant portion of your principal. In August 2024, the largest bond ETF in the U.S. was the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, which held $115 billion in net assets. Changes in interest rates can have a significant effect on bond ETFs and other fixed-income investments. Increasing interest rates tend to make bonds and bond ETFs tumble. For this reason, bond ETFs may be more appropriate for those who can tolerate the interest rate risk and hold the asset over a long period, particularly if you need to wait for a shift in the interest rate environment. etf.com. \u201cBond ETFs Tumble to 2023 Lows as Rates Surge.\u201d iShares. \"iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF.\""

Making an informed decision between investing in dividend exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) 500 index requires understanding your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Both are solid vehicles for long-term investment, but they offer distinct advantages and disadvantages. This guide provides a comprehensive look at the performance, pros, cons, and key differences between these two popular investments, setting you on a more informed investment path. Dividend ETFs seek out value stocks with higher-than-average dividend yields\u2014making them a good choice for income-oriented investors. The S&P 500 is a broad index of large-cap American stocks, some of which pay dividends while others do not. You cannot invest directly in the S&P 500. To get exposure to the whole of the S&P 500, you would need to buy a mutual fund or ETF that mirrors the S&P 500, like the SPDR (SPY). The S&P 500 is often better for those looking to balance capital growth and income potential. It offers diversification across several sectors and has a history of steady long-term returns. Before diving into the specific characteristics of dividend ETFs and the S&P 500, it\u2019s crucial to know two fundamental investment approaches: dividend investing and broad-based index investing. Each serves a distinct purpose and appeals to different types of investors based on factors like risk tolerance, financial goals, and the need for income or growth. Dividend investing is a strategy centered on acquiring the stocks of companies that pay dividends to their shareholders. These dividends are usually distributed as cash payments or additional shares of stock. Dividends are appealing because they provide a regular income, making this strategy popular among retirees or those seeking to supplement their earnings. Companies that pay dividends are also likely more durable and financially stable, which can translate to less volatility in your portfolio. However, dividend investing often leans toward particular sectors that are not known for outsized growth, such as utilities or consumer staples, which could limit your chances for capital appreciation. Reinvesting dividends can significantly increase long-term returns. Thanks to the power of compounding, this process can lead to exponential growth in the value of your investment, as not only your initial investment but also the reinvested dividends earn returns. Index investing aims for more comprehensive and diverse exposure to the market. This strategy is not confined to a particular sector or type of stock, but distributes the risk by holding various assets. This is done by tracking a benchmark index. The focus is generally on long-term growth, capturing the movement of the overall market. Because of this, index funds usually have lower fees than actively managed funds, allowing you to keep more of your returns. While the primary aim is growth, many indexes like the S&P 500 also include dividend-paying stocks, offering a modest income stream. Consistent income Less volatility Potential tax benefits Limited growth potential Vulnerability caused by sector concentration Taxes on dividend income Sensitive to interest rate changes Dividend ETFs are designed to generate consistent income. While they might not always grow dramatically, they are often perceived as stable and somewhat conservative. Because of this, they attract income-oriented investors. These ETFs often hold high-dividend-paying common stocks, preferred stocks, and real estate investment trusts (REITs) to earn a high dividend yield. When you invest in dividend ETFs, you\u2019re essentially signing up for a more predictable and consistent income stream. This makes these funds attractive to individuals nearing retirement or those who like the comfort of regular payments landing in their accounts. It\u2019s like having a tenant who always pays the rent on time; you know what to expect and when to expect it. Another reason to consider dividend ETFs is their relative stability in turbulent markets. These funds usually invest in financially solid companies that have proven track records. These stocks often act as buffers in a volatile market, protecting your investment. It\u2019s like insurance in case your tenant turns out not so good; you hope you\u2019ll never need it, but it\u2019s good to know it\u2019s there. Don\u2019t overlook the potential tax benefits, either. The Internal Revenue Service often taxes qualified dividends lower than ordinary income. Over time, this favorable tax treatment can make a noticeable difference in your returns. However, dividend ETFs are not without pitfalls. One of the tradeoffs for consistent income and lower risk is frequently a lower potential for growth. Companies that regularly pay out dividends tend to be more conservative in reinvesting profits for expansion. This can be a drawback if you\u2019re looking for strong capital gains over the long term. Sensitivity to interest rate changes is another factor to consider. When interest rates climb, the fixed income from dividends can become less appealing than bonds and other interest-bearing assets. This shift in investor preferences can lead to a drop in the share prices of dividend-paying companies, affecting the overall value of your ETF. Also, don\u2019t forget you must pay taxes on the dividends you receive, even if you reinvest them. Finally, there\u2019s the issue of sector concentration. Many dividend ETFs are heavily invested in specific industries with dividend-paying track records, such as utilities and consumer staples. While this focus can add predictability, it can make your portfolio less diversified and more vulnerable to sector-specific risks. Broad diversification Low-cost investments Potential for growth Market sensitivity No guaranteed income Short-term volatility The S&P 500 is often the benchmark index for the health of the overall U.S. stock market. It includes the 500 largest American companies, which amount to approximately 80% of total market capitalization. The S&P has long been a reliable performer that balances capital growth and income, making it a versatile choice for different types of investors. It is well-diversified, holding a range of stocks from each sector. Investing in a mutual fund or ETF that mirrors the S&P 500 index means you\u2019re not putting all your eggs in one basket but 500 of them. You\u2019re getting a slice of the broader U.S. economy, diversifying your investment across industries like technology, healthcare, finance, and consumer goods. This diversified approach can be a financial safety net, reducing your exposure to downturns in any sector. The index captures the performance of 500 of the largest and most influential companies in the United States, many of which are growth-oriented. Over the last 20 years, for example, this has translated into an average annual return of around 9.75% (not adjusted for inflation). While the S&P 500 includes some dividend-paying companies, its primary appeal lies in its ability to capture market-wide growth. The S&P 500 is also one of the most traded indexes in the world, attracting a wide range of investors, from individuals to massive institutional funds. This high level of trading activity means you can easily buy or sell shares at market prices with minimal delay. High liquidity translates to more flexibility, allowing for quicker adjustments to your portfolio in response to market changes or your financial needs. Finally, S&P 500 index funds and ETFs are very low-cost investments. This is because they are passively managed and simply mirror the index\u2019s returns. While the S&P 500\u2019s broad representation of the U.S. economy is an advantage in good times, it can be a liability during market downturns. Your investment is essentially a bet on the overall health of the U.S. stock market and, by extension, the U.S. economy. When the market suffers, your S&P 500 investment will also likely take a hit. It\u2019s important to be aware of this vulnerability and consider how it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy. The S&P 500 can thus experience short-term volatility because of various market events, ranging from economic data releases to geopolitical tensions. While such fluctuations are often temporary, they can be unsettling for conservative investors who prefer a more stable investment environment. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with these ups and downs, then the S&P 500 may not be the best investment for you. Finally, unlike dividend ETFs, which focus on income-generating stocks, the S&P 500 has more balanced goals. While some of its constituent companies do pay dividends, there\u2019s no assurance of consistent income. If a steady income stream is a crucial part of your investment strategy, then the S&P 500 might not fully meet your needs. The primary difference between dividend ETFs and the S&P 500 is their investment goals. Dividend ETFs are tailored for investors seeking a consistent and reliable income stream. These funds invest in companies known for paying out dividends regularly, making them a popular choice among retirees or those needing to supplement their income. Alternatively, the S&P 500 aims for a more balanced approach. While it does include some dividend-paying companies, it\u2019s focused on offering investors a snapshot of the U.S. economy\u2019s overall performance. As a result, it attracts investors who are interested in income and capital growth. Understanding this fundamental difference between the two can help you select the investment vehicle that aligns with your financial goals. When it comes to market fluctuations, dividend ETFs are generally more stable\u2014but not always. Dividend funds primarily invest in well-established companies with a history of profitability and dividend payments. These companies are usually less sensitive to ups and downs in the market, offering you a smoother ride during turbulent times. The S&P 500, however, reflects a broader range of the market, including stable giants and more volatile growth companies. As a result, it tends to be more susceptible to market volatility. If you\u2019re a risk-averse investor or looking for a less tumultuous investment experience, then you might find dividend ETFs more suitable. A significant advantage of investing in the S&P 500 is its inherent diversification. Because it includes hundreds of companies across various sectors\u2014technology, healthcare, consumer goods, and more\u2014you automatically get a diversified portfolio when you invest in this index. This broad exposure can help mitigate risks associated with downturns in any particular sector. Comparatively, dividend ETFs\u2014while diversified to some extent\u2014often have a heavier concentration in sectors known for dividend stability, such as utilities or consumer staples. This focus can be beneficial for income and lower volatility, but it might expose you to sector-specific risks and limit your portfolio\u2019s growth potential. While it\u2019s tempting to simplify the choice between dividend ETFs and the S&P 500 to a matter of risk tolerance and financial goals, there are other nuances to consider. If you\u2019re nearing retirement or desiring a consistent income stream, dividend ETFs and their lower volatility can be compelling. Conversely, if you\u2019re in the wealth accumulation phase of your life and are comfortable with market swings, the growth potential of the S&P 500 is hard to ignore. Let\u2019s consider your investment time horizon. With their focus on income and stability, dividend ETFs may offer less pressure on those with a shorter time horizon, giving you the flexibility to exit the market without significant losses. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is generally better suited for those with a longer investment horizon who can ride out market volatility for the promise of higher long-term returns. Tax considerations are another factor often overlooked. Qualified dividends are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, but you still have to pay those taxes. However, if you\u2019re investing in a tax-advantaged account like a 401(k) or an individual retirement account (IRA), dividends could be more efficient in terms of your taxes since you won\u2019t be taxed on gains until you make withdrawals (or not at all, if it\u2019s a Roth 401(k) or IRA). The state of the economy can also influence your choice. In a booming economy, growth stocks in the S&P 500 often outperform others, while in a recession or a stagnant economy, the reliable dividends from a dividend ETF could have a financial cushion. The state and trajectory of the broader market and economy can help inform your decision. Finally, consider the cost of investment. While dividend ETFs and S&P 500 index funds generally offer lower expense ratios than actively managed funds, some dividend ETFs charge slightly higher fees because of the additional research and selection involved in picking dividend-paying stocks. Not necessarily. While dividend ETFs can offer stable income, their growth potential is generally lower over the long run. That said, dividend ETFs may outperform the S&P 500 during particular time frames, such as during a recession or a period of easing interest rates. The largest ETF in the U.S., as measured by assets under management (AUM), is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). It tracks the movement of the S&P 500 and, as of Jan. 31, 2023, had $363.23 billion in AUM. The S&P 500 itself doesn\u2019t pay dividends, but many of the individual companies within the index do. When you invest in an S&P 500 index fund or ETF, you\u2019re effectively investing in a basket of 500 large-cap U.S. stocks, a significant part of which are dividend-paying companies. These dividends are usually collected by the fund and then distributed to investors, typically on a quarterly basis. As of September 2023, the dividend yield of an S&P 500 ETF was around 1.62%. Dividend ETFs and the S&P 500 serve different needs and have advantages and disadvantages. To make a more informed choice, assess your financial goals, risk appetite, and diversification requirements. Both can potentially be valuable parts of a balanced investment portfolio, but they are typically held for different purposes: steady income vs. growth.

Learn the importance of ESG and how you can invest in it d3sign / Getty Images Growing climate concerns and social injustice have more investors wondering about how to invest in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) funds and stocks. The idea behind ESG investing is to make a difference with the dollars you invest by supporting companies that demonstrate policies congruent with improving the environment, positive social justice, and furthering sound governance. If you want to grow your wealth while creating a more just world, then you need to understand ESG in investing. Find out how to invest in ESG, from opening a brokerage account to researching ESG investments. This article will cover a range of ESG investments and strategies so that you can align your money with your values. How to incorporate ESG factors in investing is straightforward. With accessible ESG screeners as well as funds dedicated to this investment approach, ESG investing is as easy as selecting a few screening parameters and searching through a database for the sustainable investments that fit your needs. To begin your ESG investing journey, you\u2019ll need to choose an investment platform, typically an online brokerage account. After opening and funding the account, you\u2019ll visit the research section of the platform to screen for your ESG investments. Next, pick the assets that fit your criteria and proceed to buy shares in the stock, bond, or fund. Here\u2019s how it works. Step 1: Open an Online Brokerage Account Step 2: Understand Your ESG Criteria ESG factors encompass a range of criteria spanning the environment, societal issues, and sound government. ESG funds can be broad and include a range of companies that fit into a broad environmental, social or governance framework. Other ESG assets may focus on components of ESG investing, such as lowering carbon emissions, improving worker equity, gender diversity, minority empowerment, greater board diversity, investing in green projects, and ethical labor management. Most screeners assign a company an ESG score. The score includes how well the company fits within widely accepted ESG criteria and typically consists of a five point scale from one to five. Before screening to find the best ESG companies to invest in, determine the lowest ESG score you\u2019ll accept. Finally, decide whether you\u2019re seeking a broad or targeted ESG fund, or prefer screening for individual ESG companies. Step 3: Research ESG Investments Next decide among two ESG investing approaches. With the self-directed investing route, you screen for and select your preferred ESG investments. Or, if you\u2019d like to outsource your ESG investing, you might consider a robo-advisor that offers ESG investments. Robo-advisors are low-fee investment managers that offer various core and strategy portfolios in line with your goals and risk tolerance levels. Step 4: Choose an ESG Investment After you\u2019ve selected your ESG investments, you\u2019re ready to proceed. The final step in how to invest in ESG companies or funds is simply placing a trade on your brokerage platform app or desktop. While on the screen for the ESG investment there is usually a button labeled \u201cTrade.\u201d Or you can select the website\u2019s \u201cTrade\u201d menu item. Once on the trade screen, you\u2019ll follow these simple steps: The Orders page of the platform will show the details of the trade and whether it has been filled or not. Once the order is filled, money will be transferred from your cash balance to fund the new ESG stock or fund purchase. Opening an online brokerage account is as easy as following the online prompts. Click on the button that says \u201cstart here\u201d or \u201copen an account.\u201d Next, provide the personal and financial information listed below. After this, you simply link a funding source (usually a bank account) and you\u2019re ready to begin your ESG investing journey. The brokerage industry follows the highest security and compliance levels when dealing with your money and investing activities. All personal information requested is required by law to ensure that you are who you claim to be and is protected by the company. Here is the personal information that you\u2019ll typically need to open an online brokerage account: Investment brokers are closely regulated and must ensure your suitability for the various investment products that the firm offers. When opening your investment account you\u2019ll need to provide financial information as part of the know your client standard, including: ESG investing is a strategy to ferret out companies that meet specific environmental, social, and good governance parameters. Here\u2019s an example of the factors that are considered in each of the ESG or sustainable investing categories: The growth in ESG investing is driven by a broad desire for a more just society. ESG investors hope that by investing in sustainable companies, capital will flow into companies that meet the ESG standards and thus further a healthier planet and more compassionate corporate society. An ESG score is a quantifiable determinant of a company\u2019s rank on a range of environmental, social, and governance issues. Various organizations calculate and attempt to standardize ESG scores. ESG scores are based on information from securities filings, corporate disclosures, government databases, academic studies, media reports, and more. Screeners typically assign companies and funds an ESG score between one and five. When searching for ESG investments, select your preferred ESG score. Scores will vary by industry and reporting agency, and like any published metric, should be considered as one of several inputs into an investment decision. Wondering why to invest in ESG? The reasons vary and include the potential personal, financial, and societal benefits. Ranking companies by ESG criteria provides a rubric that enables governments, businesses, and individuals to work together to progress on societal and global issues. ESG investing benefits include: With the popularity of sustainable ESG investing, there are many ESG investments available. Self-directed investors can screen for ESG funds and individual companies. hose who prefer robo-advisors or managed portfolios have many choices as well. Types of ESG investments: ESG investing remains a strategy to build long-term wealth. Sustainable investors should consider ESG scores along with the traditional investment selection strategies. These might include fundamental analysis for stock picking, meaning ESG ratings are a metric along with debt-to-equity ratios and earnings-per-share. For fund selection, it\u2019s wise to review expense ratios, performance metrics, and the stated investment strategy. Begin your search for ESG investments by choosing a platform with robust investment selection and screening. This might be your financial firm like Schwab or Fidelity. Research sites such as Morningstar can also provide useful ESG investment research information. Next, you will select the screening factors, both ESG and traditional. Following are factors to consider when investing in ESG: ESG companies meet one or more of the widely accepted environmental, social, or governance criteria. Depending upon the ESG certification platform, the company will receive a specific score that is based upon the rating criteria. It is important to dig into the criteria to understand how companies are being evaluated and avoid greenwashing. Various ESG tracking organizations provide lists of ESG companies. You won\u2019t find tobacco companies on an ESG company list due to the health risks of smoking. Companies who make firearms are also usually omitted. A quick internet search will yield multiple lists of ESG companies to use as a springboard for your ESG company research. There are a few fund families dedicated solely to ESG investing such as Pax World Funds and Calvert Group. That said, the majority of ESG funds are created by popular fund families like iShares or Vanguard. A quick Morningstar ETF search of ESG funds with a 4 or 5 ranking (out of 5) yielded 640 offerings. From that list, you can screen for the ESG criteria that matter most to you. If you\u2019re seeking an ESG fund that focuses on gender diversity, you might like SPDR\u00ae MSCI USA Gender Diversity ETF (SHE). If you\u2019re seeking a diversified U.S. or international ESG equity fund, there are scores from which to choose such as iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU) or Calvert International Responsible Index Fund (A) (CDHAX). Unfortunately, there is not any list of best ESG funds that is universally agreed upon. The results are inconclusive. A recent Harvard Business Review article included research from Columbia University and the London School of Economics that compared the ESG record of 147 U.S. companies found in ESG portfolios with 2,428 U.S. companies found in non-ESG portfolios. The surprising finding was that the companies in the ESG portfolios had worse compliance records for labor and environmental metrics. This study also determined that those companies added to ESG portfolios didn\u2019t improve the companies\u2019 labor or environmental compliance. Adding to the confusion, there is no universally accepted definition or ESG scoring method. Performance of ESG funds has been comparable with their non-ESG competitors. It remains to be seen whether ESG investing actually helps companies comply with standard global ESG initiatives or not. ESG investing relates to ethical behavior and ascribes to the common good theory, which encourages citizens to sacrifice for the good of society. ESG strives to further ethical behavior, such as caring for the earth, treating all individuals fairly, and righting societal injustices. It\u2019s difficult to definitively determine whether ESG investing is furthering ethical behavior and creates a better society. That said, as a society, it is ethical to encourage companies to transact their businesses in a way that is beneficial to society. In that light, ESG investing is focused on the higher societal goals and therefore ESG investing is generally considered ethical.

Learn how to invest in AI and capitalize on the future Xavier Lorenzo / Getty Images Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept\u2014it's a transformative force reshaping industries and everyday life. Before investing in AI, it\u2019s useful to understand what artificial intelligence is; AI technology infuses computers and tech products with human-like intelligence and problem-solving abilities. From virtual assistants in our homes to autonomous vehicles on our roads, AI is quickly being added to many products and applications, dominating discussions of investments and questions about the future. The AI landscape is complex and news of added capabilities at one firm reshuffles the pace of change at all of them. Choosing the best AI companies to invest in is a tricky endeavor\u2014even if you're using the best online brokers and trading platforms. Just as investors half a generation ago had to separate the wheat from the chaff among web browser, smartphone, and app-based startups, so too are niche players and established tech giants now vying for AI market share and research capital. In this article, we explore how to invest in AI and showcase the best AI stocks and funds. Like past emerging technologies, such as railroads in the late 1800s or the personal computer in the 1980s, there are many ways to invest in AI. While some companies will have wild success, other early companies will fail. The computer revolution is an apt analogy for AI investing and how to invest in AI. Computers set the stage for automating mundane and repeatable tasks, and now AI seeks to advance this concept by automating tasks that previously required human intelligence. Investors can find some top AI stocks have one-year returns in the high double digits, with NVIDIA reporting 176% 12-month growth as of July 23, 2024. Some people want to invest directly in companies that develop AI, while others might invest in those companies that stand to benefit the most from its wider adoption. Using the introduction and growth of the personal computer industry as an example, some investors successfully invested in computer manufacturers or hardware companies that made routers and switches. Others invested in software companies that produced computer programs, while others attempted to identify companies that would benefit most from the automation that computers offered. Some of these investments were direct bets on computers and the actual technology, while others were more conservative, such as buying shares in already strong companies that stood to benefit from the growth of computer usage. The point is that there are various ways to invest in a new technology. Sometimes, one firm takes and holds a market-leading position, but other times, an imitator can use the first company's technology better, making it more successful over time. Since it\u2019s tough to pick the winning AI stocks in advance, owning several or selecting an AI ETF could minimize making a wrong move. While these are among the top AI stocks, consider the business cycle and valuations before going all in. You might want to incorporate a dollar cost average into your AI stock picks as a hedge against a market drop. Investing in professionally managed ETFs or mutual funds that hold shares in AI companies allows you to leave it to a fund's professional managers to research and pick suitable AI companies. Through an ETF, you own a share of a portfolio of multiple AI stocks within a single investment. Buying individual AI stocks is more work for the investor. Given the multiple ways to invest in AI, the first step is to read about the industry to understand the various aspects of artificial intelligence. Within the AI universe, there are pure plays and more conservative plays, and you'll have to decide the type of exposure you want in this market sector. Once you have an idea of the parts of the AI market you want to invest in, you can perform traditional investment analyses\u2014both fundamental and technical. AI is exploding, and the technology behind it appears poised to break out further and deliver on expectations for more widespread adoption across a wide range of businesses and real-world applications. Like any technology that requires massive capital investment, AI offers plenty of opportunities for investors to make money, but new technologies also involve risk. You'll want to determine the best way to gain exposure without involving risk beyond your tolerance. Choices include more speculative direct AI investments in individual companies or ETFs and mutual funds that offer a portfolio of multiple companies in the AI space. You can also look to invest in companies that are positioned to increase their revenues as AI is more widely adopted across the economy. Generative AI use for images is among its most popular applications. Users can type or speak of an image they want to create, and an AI program can produce an image that meets that description\u2014most of the time. These AI programs use the user\u2019s description with images available worldwide to generate the image for the user requesting the artwork. People of all ages and backgrounds have utilized AI-generated artwork. Once you\u2019ve created AI art, you can sell it and/or buy from others on AI art marketplaces. Art made with AI can be collected as giclee prints, digital downloads, NFTs, and other formats. It can be bought and sold on some crypto platforms and designated AI art websites. However, the profit and investment potential for AI art is still in its infancy and cannot be accurately ascertained. Startup companies are often created in new and promising fields, such as AI and machine learning. Often, these are companies that have been initially capitalized by venture capital investors, then taken public to capitalize on their initial investment and to raise more capital as the business increases its operations and begins offering its products to a wider customer base. Many startup investments are only available to large accredited investors. Other websites enable the public to invest small amounts in promising new ventures. You\u2019ll need to sift through the offerings to uncover the AI startup companies. While investing in startups can be risky, the rewards for investing in a successful startup company can be huge. Examples of successful startup companies include Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Yes, you can directly invest in AI and machine learning by investing in individual stocks or in ETFs or mutual funds that focus on AI stocks. Conservative investors wondering which AI stocks to buy might consider established companies that are benefiting from AI processes, while aggressive investors can seek out investments in direct AI companies. For AI investing ideas, check out the best AI stocks. This list is updated monthly. Investing in AI in 2024 offers compelling prospects for your portfolio. The technology continues to seep into the media, healthcare, automotive, finance, and other sectors. However, you'll have to navigate challenges that could include potential legal and regulatory changes, supply shortages, and the broader political and ethical considerations concerning the widespread deployment of AI systems and the ecological effects of powering them. Similar to investing in the new internet and computing industries decades ago, the winners and losers can change on a dime. Staying informed and selectively investing in companies prioritizing robust business models will be crucial for those looking to capitalize on the AI boom while mitigating risks.

Learn what it takes to buy fractional shares on Webull ArtistGNDphotography / Getty Images If you are looking to start investing in the market but don\u2019t feel like you have enough money to buy enough shares to fully diversify your portfolio, fractional shares are a great solution. This strategy allows you to invest in stocks based on a specific dollar amount rather than buying a specific number of shares. This allows you to diversify your funds and start investing at a lower threshold. Buying fractional shares on Webull\u2019s platform is streamlined and easy. You simply open and fund an account to access fractional shares from an approved list of thousands of stocks and ETFs. We\u2019ll take an in-depth look at how to buy fractional shares through Webull and cover the basics to help you decide if fractional share trading is the right fit for your portfolio needs. Buying fractional shares on Webull is a very simple process. To open an account, you have to provide some basic personal information as well as details on your employment, financial status, and what type of securities you want to invest in. Once the application has been filled out, most investors will receive an email with account approval within minutes. Once the account has been approved, you merely need to fund the account and you will be ready to start investing. Step 1: Open a Webull account. Opening an account with Webull is straightforward. Users can sign up using their phone number and verification code, or sign up using their Facebook or Google profile. You will then have the option to select \u201copen an account.\u201d Next you will be asked to verify your identity by uploading a photo of your driver\u2019s license or another form of identification. From there, you will enter in your basic personal information, employment information, financial information, and the type of account you want to open. Once all this is filled out, you will enter your email address for verification of account application approval. When you receive the email letting you know your account is approved, you are ready to fund your account and start investing. You can fund the account via an ACH transfer with a linked bank account using the \u201cmake your first deposit\u201d button. It is important to note that you can choose between a cash account and a margin account. With the cash account, you can purchase stocks with whatever funds you deposit. A margin account requires an account balance above $2,000 and unlocks the ability to use leverage beyond your balance to increase your buying power. Step 2: Log in to your Webull account. Once you have opened a Webull account, you can login and search for the stock or exchange traded fund (ETF) that you\u2019d like to buy fractional shares of. If fractional share trading is available for that particular stock, there will be a green diamond icon on the stock. Step 3: Click the \u201cTrade\u201d tab. After deciding on the stock that you\u2019d like to buy and determining that it can be traded in fractional shares, you will click the \u201ctrade\u201d button at the bottom of your screen. From there, switch the order type to \u201cmarket,\u201d as fractional share trading at Webull can only take place currently as a market order during market hours. Step 4: Change setting from \u201cShares\u201d to \u201cDollars.\u201d You will then need to change the setting from \u201cshare\u201d to \u201cUSD\u201d in order to buy fractional shares. Enter the dollar amount that you\u2019d like to invest and review all order information for accuracy. Step 5: Submit your order. Once you have verified your order information, click the \u201cbuy\u201d button at the bottom of the screen to place your order. You will want to carefully review your order before clicking the \u201cbuy\u201d button because once an order is placed, Webull does not have the option to modify an open order. To open your new account at Webull, you will need to provide your basic personal and financial information. When opening your account online, you will be asked to provide personal and contact information: In addition to providing your personal information, you will be asked to provide your employment and basic financial information. After your account application has been approved, you will then have the option to fund your account via ACH transfer from your current U.S. bank account or wire transfer from U.S. or foreign banks (fees may apply for wire transfers). Unlike a full service brokerage, Webull does not ask you about your financial goals or long-term financial planning. The platform currently offered is transactional in nature only. If you are looking for a low-cost, no-commission platform that is easy to use for placing trades, Webull is a good option. However, if you are looking for a more comprehensive platform\u2013offering account consolidation, goal planning, or research\u2013you may need to look elsewhere. The most obvious benefit of opening an account and trading fractional shares at Webull is the speed of the process. You can literally open an account within minutes and start trading. Webull offers thousands of U.S. stocks and ETFs for fractional share trading. However, you can really only determine which stocks and ETFs are currently on the list by searching in your account dashboard and seeing if the green diamond icon that indicates fractional share availability is by the stock or ETF. In terms of the quality of the trading platform, Webull offers a decent selection of charting tools and a basic stock screener. Webull may not be as full-featured as larger brokers, but for a streamlined, no-fee brokerage, it is more than adequate for fundamental stock research and basic technical analysis. Webull also offers access to other assets, including options that will appeal to more active traders. Another differentiating factor is that Webull offers margin trading. Because of the volatility of the market and the fact that trading on margin is actually borrowing money from Webull that you must pay back with interest, this option may be best suited for a more seasoned investor. It is important to remember that when investing using a margin account that you will still have to pay back the original amount borrowed plus interest even if the stocks lose value. All that said, buying fractional shares with a cash account is quick and easy, and funding your Webull account can be done via either ACH funds transfer or wire transfer. Selection of stocks and ETFs available for fractional share investing: Webull offers thousands of stocks and ETFs for fractional share investing. However, in order to find which stocks or ETFs are approved, you must search the specific stock from your Webull account dashboard and look for the green diamond icon to determine if the stock can be traded in fractional shares or not. Fees and commissions: Getting started at Webull is simple with $0 commissions for online U.S. stock and ETF trades. There are also no account management fees or inactivity fees to buy and sell fractional shares. Account minimums: Investors at Webull can buy fractional shares for as low as $5; there is no minimum to open an account. Research amenities: Once you open an account with Webull, you will have access to limited research amenities from your account dashboard. Investors can go to the \u201cmarkets\u201d tab and search any stock or ETF to see the current market price and basic information. The \u201cnews\u201d tab is another resource that compiles articles from multiple sources across the internet on trending financial topics. Educational content: The educational content provided by Webull is basic information on how to invest, what investment products the brokerage offers, and how to use the Webull app. Investors can access this library of videos from the \u201clearn\u201d tab. Fractional shares allow investors to buy a fraction, or portion, of a whole share of a stock. Investing in fractional shares helps you to easily diversify your portfolio and invest in companies that you may otherwise not be able to easily buy shares of. For instance, if you want to invest in a company, but the stock price is $100 per share, you don\u2019t need to have $100 to buy a full share. At Webull, you can invest in this company for as little as $5. In this case, your stake in the company will be 0.05 of a full share (5/100). With this strategy, you are investing based on a specific dollar amount that you set, not an individual stock\u2019s price or a certain number of shares. Buying fractional shares provides investors with a lower entry point of accessibility, thereby allowing themto gain market entry sooner into expensive stocks. Moreover, with fractional shares of ETFs, investors can diversify their portfolio at smaller account values than would otherwise be possible. Webull, founded in 2017, is a Chinese-owned company headquartered in New York. Webull is a discount broker that offers limited services and a straightforward, no-frills platform. Offering commission-free trades, no fees, and no account minimum requirements, Webull has positioned itself to serve newer and more active traders. Currently, the company offers standard brokerage accounts, which provide the choice to invest in: Fractional share trading is currently offered on thousands of stocks and ETFs at Webull, but it is only available for the latest version of the mobile app. Keep in mind that only stocks and ETFs from an approved list are available for fractional share trading, so while you may want to invest in options or crypto, that cannot be done fractionally at this time. Investing in fractional shares is a good way to dollar-cost average your money into the market. When utilizing this strategy on a regular basis, you will be buying fractions of several stocks over the course of time, which will accumulate into a portfolio that includes full shares of multiple stocks. Buying shares of a stock over time reduces the effect of market timing where you may be paying a premium or getting a discount on a transaction based on market factors. Lowering the total cost paid for an asset can make you money, provided that the asset appreciates over time. Over time, diversified portfolios are more likely than not to appreciate. Webull is not the only option when it comes to fractional share trading. Charles Schwab is an excellent online platform to buy fractional shares of stocks. Investors can choose from any stock listed on the approved list of S&P 500 stocks for an investment as low as $5. Schwab also allows investors to choose up to 30 \u201cslices\u201d each time they place an order, so diversifying your portfolio is quite easy to do. As many options as investors have when buying fractional shares at Charles Schwab, ETFs are one product that is not currently available. Webull offers fractional shares on select ETFs, as do other Schwab competitors like Fidelity. Not owning a full share of a company can make it more complicated when you want to sell it. Webull offers investors fractional share trading as market orders only. When selling, there is a minimum of 0.00001 shares per order for closing fractional share positions. It is also noted on the website that \u201cthe rule of $5 minimum doesn't work for closing fractional share positions.\u201d Fractional shares are not able to be transferred, so any fractional share would need to be sold prior to a transfer taking place.

Luis Alvarez / Getty Images One of the basic tenets of investing is to diversify your portfolio in order to hedge against market risk. This can be hard to do if you are just starting out or have a limited amount of money to invest. However, investing in fractional shares through online brokers opens up opportunities to purchase portions of higher-priced stocks with the money you have on hand. We\u2019ll take a deep dive into how investing in fractional shares works at Fidelity and answer the basic questions needed to help you decide if this approach is right for you. Buying fractional shares at Fidelity is quite simple. Investors have access to more than 7,000 U.S. stocks and ETFs for fractional share trading. Fidelity offers several types of accounts that investors can use to buy fractional shares and makes it easy to start investing with low fees and low minimum investment requirements. Opening an online account at Fidelity is quick and easy. You will need to provide your basic personal information and select the type of account that you want to open. Once you have opened an account with Fidelity, you will need to log in and fund your account. Remember, fractional share trading takes place in real-time, so the funds will need to be settled and available in your account in order to place a trade. The \u201ctrade\u201d tab is at the top left of your Fidelity dashboard. Once you click on \u201ctrade,\u201d a dropdown menu will open with a form to fill out regarding what type of trade you\u2019d like to make. By selecting the \u201cDollars\u201d setting, you will be able to buy fractional shares. This will base your order on a specific dollar amount, instead of buying a specific number of shares. Dollar amounts can be entered out to two decimal places, for example, $50.75. The order is then converted into shares out to three decimal places and rounded down to the nearest decimal. Fractional share orders are entered as market orders or limit orders and are only good for the day. At the bottom of the trading form, you will then click \u201cPreview order.\u201d This will lead to a confirmation screen where you can edit, cancel, or place the order. Fractional share trading is done in real-time, during market hours, so you will know your share price. Below is a comparison of Fidelity with other brokers. To open your new account at Fidelity, you will need to provide your basic personal and financial information. You can also choose the type of account that you\u2019d like to open, depending on your financial investing needs and goals. The following Fidelity retail accounts are approved for buying fractional shares: When opening your account online, you will be asked to provide personal and contact information: Besides providing your personal information, you will be asked to provide your financial information. This will include particulars regarding your current financial situation, as well as your investing goals. These are the \u201cknow your client\u201d questions that Fidelity must ask to ensure you\u2019re being matched to investments that are appropriate for your financial situation and risk tolerance. As part of this process, you may even choose to link your current bank account or use mobile deposit in order to fund your Fidelity account more quickly. That said, sending a check in the mail is also an option. There are several benefits of opening an account and trading fractional shares at Fidelity: One of the key benefits of investing with Fidelity is that it offers over 7,000 U.S. stocks and ETFs for fractional share trading. Some brokers only offer a handful of stocks to choose from for this type of investing, so Fidelity gives you a larger chunk of the market to work with. Fidelity has long been recognized as a leader in the industry for its low-cost fees and for delivering value to customers. Fidelity has continued to improve and offers new products to investors as markets have developed. Fidelity has introduced exposure to crypto and digital payments, in addition to stocks, bonds, ETFs, and fractional share trading. Fidelity does all this through a user-friendly desktop platform and mobile experience for investors, and effectively uses dashboards to make it easier for investors to keep up-to-date on their accounts and their progress towards financial goals. Fractional shares may complicate tax reporting, as each sale can trigger taxable events based on share allocations. Fidelity has a wide selection of stock and ETF offerings for fractional share investing, making over 7,000 shares available for dollar-cost averaging via fractional shares. One unique product that Fidelity offers is FidFolios, which enables investors to construct their own customized index of stocks and ETFs. Getting started at Fidelity is made simple with $0 commissions for online U.S. stock and ETF trades. There are also no account fees or minimums to open a retail brokerage account. Investors at Fidelity can buy fractional shares for as low as $1 and there is no minimum to open a self-managed investment account. Investing in Fidelity Managed FidFolios does require a $5,000 minimum, though. Once you open an account with Fidelity, you will have access to research amenities right from your account dashboard. Investors can access a plethora of research and news from the \u201cNews & Research\u201d tab at the top of the dashboard, with a dropdown menu offering information on the latest news, watch lists, quotes, alerts, and much more. Knowing how to invest, what to invest in, and how to reach your financial goals are important, and the educational content provided by Fidelity can help you do just that. Investors can utilize the \u201cPlanning & Advice\u201d tab on their dashboard to become more informed investors. Investors can find articles and information on topics ranging from investing basics to long-term care planning. Account users will also find it easy to access information regarding stocks, mutual funds, or ETFs in which they would like to invest, as well as other investment vehicles. Investing in fractional shares helps you to easily diversify your portfolio and invest in companies that you may otherwise not be able to afford. Fractional shares\u2014or \u201cStocks by the Slice,\u201d as Fidelity calls them\u2014allow investors to buy a fraction of a whole share of a stock. With this strategy, you are investing based on a dollar amount, not an individual stock\u2019s price or a certain number of shares. Buying fractional shares provides investors with a lower entry point of accessibility, thereby allowing investors to gain market entry sooner. It also allows you to employ dollar-cost averaging across a basket of larger stocks that you would otherwise have to save up to slowly accumulate shares. The ability to dollar-cost average into an ETF, for example, gives smaller investors the same advantages that large-scale investors enjoy in terms of diversification. Fidelity is the largest U.S. brokerage, was founded in 1943, and is headquartered in Boston. The company has $15 trillion in assets under administration and $5.8 trillion in discretionary assets. Fidelity has been able to use its economies of scale to continue to offer competitive products and services while maintaining a low-fee structure for clients. Although it is undoubtedly a large, traditional brokerage, Fidelity has been able to remain at the forefront of the industry by embracing technology and launching new products and services including digital investment management, crypto and digital payments, Active Trader Pro, and the Fidelity Metaverse. As with any investment, fractional shares have the potential to both make and lose money, depending on the market performance of the asset you are investing in. Investing in fractional shares is a good way to dollar-cost average your money into the market. If you are investing on a regular basis, you will be buying \u201cslices\u201d of several stocks over time. This will not only allow you to take advantage of dips in the market when buying but over time, will enable you to build a portfolio that consists of full shares of multiple stocks. The key difference is that this portfolio will be diversified throughout the whole accumulation stage rather than only growing in diversification as your account balance grows. Yes, Fidelity offers ETFs as fractional shares. Fidelity offers investors over 7,000 choices of individual stocks and ETFs to buy as fractional shares. Fidelity also offers FidFolios, which allows you to create your own customized index of stocks and ETFs. This specialized product does require a $5,000 minimum investment, though. However, you can start investing in fractional shares of individual stocks and ETFs for just $1. Fidelity offers investors real-time trading during market hours. It is possible that fractional shares for certain securities may not be liquid and National Financial Services (NFS), which acts in a mixed capacity (as principal for the fractional share components and as agent for the whole share components) will not be able to guarantee a market for the security. Fractional shares are also not able to be transferred, so any fractional share would need to be sold prior to a transfer taking place. On the whole, however, fractional shares of larger, liquid stocks are just as easy to sell as their whole counterparts. Investing in fractional shares through platforms like Fidelity offers a practical way for investors with limited funds to diversify their portfolios. The process is simple and involves opening an account, funding it, and placing trades based on dollar amounts. While fractional shares provide easier market entry, they come with certain limitations, such as liquidity issues and non-transferability; however, Fidelity's user-friendly platform, low fees, and educational resources make it a strong choice for beginners looking to diversify their investments.

Learn what it takes to Invest in Commodities Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Yaroslav Olieinikov / Getty Images Adding commodities to a portfolio, either through physical ownership or investment brokers, provides diversification and can even offer a hedge against price exposure further up the value chain of certain industries. Energy products like oil, gas, and coal; agricultural products like corn, soy, canola, pork, and beef; and metals like gold, silver, copper, and platinum all have well understood market dynamics and relatively simple financial instruments to act as trading vehicles. Many commodities are priced according to the market demand and the need for further processing. In a world where many financial assets are derivatives, trackers, and derivatives of derivatives, with layers of market sentiment influencing their performance, commodities can offer a more direct experience. We will take a look at the major commodities and how you can use them to fit your investment needs. Investors can access commodities in a few different ways. Owning physical commodities mainly applies to precious metals. Gold and silver are two of the best-known commodities that are used as physical stores of value. Investors can purchase these metals formed into bullion, with standard size and purity. Bullion bars are the closest in value to the melt price (the market price for the metal if you melted it down). Owning precious metals in physical form comes with issues of storage, insurance, and liquidity. Commodities beyond precious metals have further storage issues in that the quantities are often larger and there is a shelf life, so they must be sold within a given timeframe. This is why most commodities investors do not pursue physical ownership. To trade physical commodities, you need to find a reputable dealer and, most likely, a storage facility for your holdings. Futures contracts are direct plays on commodity prices. Futures contracts are an agreement to buy or sell a specified amount of a commodity at a specified price and date in the future. Investors use leveraged margin accounts to allow them to take larger positions with their existing capital. In the vast majority of trades, the contracts are cash settled. This saves an investor from having to take delivery of hundreds of thousands of pounds of sugar or figure out how to market a thousand head of cattle. Opening an account to trade futures contracts will often require some additional paperwork to enable margin trading as well as a higher account minimum. The specific maintenance margin needed in an account varies with the value of the contract being traded. Individual securities related to commodity processing or production can be accessed through a regular brokerage account. You can find the companies using a stock screener and looking for basic materials or energy sector companies. Investors looking for commodity exposure through company shares generally have to gain some industry-specific knowledge to be successful. For example, extraction companies in mining and energy have well-developed systems for feasibility studies on reserves that, in turn, drive the stock value. Larger companies will have reserves in different parts of the world and in different stages of development, meaning the impact of any one feasibility study is not a big deal as long as overall operations are profitable. A smaller company, however, may experience heightened price volatility based on the findings of a single feasibility study. Products traded on exchanges include commodity-based mutual funds, ETFs, and exchange-traded notes, which can provide exposure to commodities. There are exchange-traded products that are specific to individual commodities. These pool investor funds to combine capital in a commodity pool. The actual mechanism for investment depends on what is outlined by the fund. The fund managers could buy futures, options on futures, shares in companies in the sector, or even purchase and store physical goods. Some funds are leveraged, meaning they are attempting to provide double or triple the price movement of the commodity they are tracking. This is why it is important to read the fund disclosures prior to investing to ensure the exposure being offered matches your investment needs. Commodities are considered an alternative investment along with things like real estate that don\u2019t trade in the conventional style of stocks and bonds. Within precious metals, however, there is a subcategory of alternative investments that are closer to collectibles than they are to investments. Bullion coins and jewelry have an aesthetic and historical value that generally sees them trade at a premium compared to the melt price of the metals they contain. While these are still physical investments that can appreciate in value, their prices are less connected to market prices. You can buy jewelry from stores and coins directly from the Mint or from dealers, but they are more of a collectible than they are a commodity investment. Opening a commodities investing account is the same process as opening a regular brokerage account. If you are just looking to invest in commodities through companies and funds, it literally is a regular brokerage account as these two investment classes do not require anything special. If you will be trading futures and options, however, you first need to confirm your broker provides these options. Then you will usually have to make some additional disclosures to ensure you understand the risks and have enough capital so that it will not be wiped out in a single trade. To open a brokerage account, you need to provide some personal and financial information and\u00a0 answer some basic questions. The personal and financial information includes: With online brokerages, the first step is usually to set up an account (email and password) with the broker and then provide these further details as part of the onboarding process. While there are many brokerage accounts with zero account minimums, enabling futures trading in a margin account will generally require that at least a few thousand dollars be held with the broker. Depending on the contracts you are looking to trade, the actual amount of capital required to trade will be more than whatever the minimum deposit is to enable the account. Both the initial margin and the maintenance margin for futures accounts may be influenced by the account type (individual retirement account vs. non-IRA account). Gold individual retirement accounts (gold IRAs) are a type of commodity investing for retirement purposes. Unlike a regular IRA, you will have to find a custodian to hold the physical assets. You set up a gold IRA by first establishing a self-directed IRA, selecting a custodian to administer the account, selecting an approved depository to hold the gold, and then choosing a broker/dealer to buy the gold through. Some gold IRA providers have these services integrated or will refer clients to providers in their network. The documents and information required are the same as those for investment accounts: Minimum deposits for a gold IRA are high. This is partially owing to the fact that an ounce of gold is worth over $1000 and even smaller coins are worth several hundred dollars. The IRS rules state that only approved coins and bars of gold can be used for a gold IRA, but they do not set a minimum. While not all gold IRAs advertise a minimum, a practical amount would be at least $2000. Other gold IRAs have minimums of $10,000, $25,000, and even $60,000. Commodity investing, like any other type of investing, comes with advantages and disadvantages. Investors are attracted to commodity investing for its ability to provide an inflation hedge, diversify a portfolio, and unlock potentially large returns. The downsides to commodity investing are a lack of income, high volatility, and external risks. Commodities investing is not available through every broker. This is especially true for digital investment managers that limit their investing to ETFs and stocks. Larger brokers and trading-focused platforms generally do offer futures trading. This includes brokers like Schwab, Interactive Brokers, and E*TRADE, as well as more focused platforms like NinjaTrader and TradeStation. Below are the main factors to consider when opening an investment account for commodities trading. Customer support can vary widely between brokers. Most brokers still offer phone and email support, while some have added in-platform chat and social media channels for customers to reach them. A handful of brokers have gone the other way, with digital-only customer service offerings via FAQs and email contact forms. When it comes to customer service, you want to make sure the broker can be reached via your preferred method. Fees have become much more competitive for stocks and ETFs, with most brokers charging nothing at all. When it comes to futures, however, fees are calculated on a per-contract basis and can vary from mere cents to a few dollars. While the temptation is to find the lowest fee broker for futures, it is important to consider it in the context of the quality of the overall trading platform. While most brokers offer both ETFs and stocks, futures is more of a niche offering. If you are looking to invest in commodities, you are probably going to want access to the major futures exchanges unless you plan on solely working through ETFs. Generally speaking, you want to know that your broker is keeping your portfolio safe and has your best interests at heart. At a minimum, you want to see security protocols that are up to industry standards with two-factor authentication and plans in place to prevent outages and data breaches. Overall we like to see brokers with low minimum deposits to encourage people to invest. When it comes to futures, however, an investor should have a sizable amount of capital both to enable the margin account and ensure they can handle potential swings without devastating their portfolios. Commodities investing is definitely a risk capital activity and shouldn\u2019t make up the majority of your investment portfolio. Research tools can be important in helping you understand and visualize market dynamics when investing in commodities. Robust trading platforms can help by pulling quotes into charts and analyzing volume and volatility along with other important information like headlines and calendar events. Some brokers charge for extra data feeds, but this is another area where competition has lowered the overall costs. Commodities are the raw, or simplest, form of inputs that go into processing that turns them into energy, food, consumer products, and so on. Metals are an example of a commodity and encompasses a group of commodities with more complicated dynamics. Many metal commodities are well known. Gold is traded as a commodity and is often used as a hedge or safe haven against downturns in the financial markets. Silver has a similar hedge angle to it and shares some common traits with gold in terms of collectibility and jewelry, but it also has industrial applications that play a role in its demand. More common metals like copper see their demand rise with basic economic activity, as they are primarily destined for further applications in industry. Steel is also traded as a commodity even though it is a value-added form of iron. The many, many applications of steel make it a commodity in terms of the type of hedging and financial exposure market participants are looking for. Metals aren\u2019t the only commodities where the market holds different forms of the same input. Sugar, which is considered a soft commodity on account of being perishable, is traded as Sugar No. 11, Sugar No. 16, and White Sugar. Sugar No. 11 is the raw product benchmark with Sugar No. 16 having a market nuance in being meant for U.S. consumption, and White Sugar referring to the more refined product that goes into yet other products. Although many commodities travel the globe, like metals and sugar, the actual volume of trading will vary significantly and may also have seasonal trends. The volume on copper commodity contracts, for example, is often many times that of an agricultural soft commodity like soybean oil. Commodities that are less widely traded often require a bit more work to understand in terms of the market dynamics and pricing pressures, but acquiring this specialized knowledge can make a big difference for investors and traders looking to profit from the global trade of inputs. Commodities investing is simply adding exposure to commodities as an asset class. This could be directly, as with physical assets like gold or silver bullion, or through financial derivatives that trade on exchanges. Financial derivatives include options and futures, as well as commodity tracking funds and shares in companies that are directly involved in producing or processing a commodity. The main reasons for commodity investing are the potential for large returns, the inflation hedge, and the diversity it brings to a portfolio due to a low correlation with the rest of the financial markets. Some of the most widely traded commodities include: It is noteworthy that\u00a0 the actual volume of futures trading is now dominated by futures on financial assets rather than raw commodities. Equity index, interest rates, and currencies all generate more contract volume than agriculture, energy, or metals. Commodities are also traded by leveraged commodity funds that, in turn, trade as fund shares. These are often split into bull and bear funds, making it clear which market position they are taking. Unlike a direct futures or options position, an investor in a bear or bull fund is buying shares in the fund that is using its available capital to make direct and indirect trades related to the underlying commodity. For example, a leveraged fund can hold futures, options, shares, and other financial instruments like contracts for difference (CFD) with the goal of delivering some multiple of the reference indices performance. So a leveraged oil fund looking to provide two times West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI), for example, is aiming to give you two times whatever the change is in WTI short-term price.

Learn the various ways to buy fractional shares ArtistGNDphotography / Getty Imagea If you\u2019ve ever wanted to invest in a particular company\u2019s stock, but didn\u2019t have enough money to buy even one share, or you want to effectively diversify your funds, investing in fractional shares through online brokers or robo-advisors might be an affordable way to get started. Fractional shares allow investors to buy a portion, or fraction, of a stock based on a dollar amount that the investor can afford\u2013not based on a particular number of shares. Implementing this type of strategy is propitious for investors who may be starting out with a limited amount of money, but still want to build a diversified portfolio. We\u2019ll take an in-depth look at how investing in fractional shares works and answer the basic questions that investors need to know to get started. In order to buy fractional shares, you will need to open an investment account through either an online broker or a robo-advisor. The main difference between the two is whether you want to have full control over which fractional shares you are investing in, or if you want to have a more hands-off approach. With a robo-advisor, you will be able to set your dollar amount to invest and your investment goals, and based on that, the robo-advisor will choose your fractional share investments and automatically rebalance to keep you within your investment goal range. Step 1: Research the fractional shares you want to buy. Fractional share offerings will differ between brokerages, so knowing which stocks you want to be able to invest in via fractional shares can also help determine which brokerage you may want to use. Step 2: Open an online broker or robo-advisor account. Not all online brokers or robo-advisors offer fractional shares, so you will need to make sure the company you want to go with offers that service. It is also important to remember that every brokerage has slightly different nuances to the way they offer fractional shares, such as: Step 3: Fund the account. You will need to fund the account once you open it. Many online brokers can be funded via electronic funds transfer, but it still may take a few days for the funds to settle, so you may not be able to invest right away. Step 4: Complete and monitor your investment. Most online accounts make it very easy to monitor your portfolio using the main dashboard. Typically, you are able to see all of your account holdings at a glance, but you may also be able to utilize more advanced options, such as setting up stock alerts or automatic rebalancing, depending on what is offered by your particular online brokerage. While there are several benefits to investing in fractional shares, the following drawbacks are also worth considering: Limited stock selection: Just because a stock is publicly traded does not mean that you will be able to buy fractional shares of it. Each brokerage has its own curated list of stocks that investors can buy fractional shares of. Potential problems transferring fractional shares to a different broker: If you want to transfer your account to another brokerage, you may not be able to transfer the fractional shares. You may need to liquidate any fractional shares in order to transfer. Proxy voting may not be an option: Again, each firm also handles proxy voting differently regarding fractional shares. Make sure you know your company\u2019s policy on this ahead of time. Additional fees: Some brokerages charge additional fees for fractional share investing. This can potentially decrease profits, especially for low-dollar investment amounts. Find out if there are fees associated with fractional shares and if they are flat fees or a percentage. Trade execution may not take place in real time: If the brokerage that you are investing with does not settle your trade in real time, that could affect your cost basis. Some firms will settle all the fractional shares in one or more bulk orders rather than settling each order individually. Obviously, prices can fluctuate throughout a trading day, so understanding how this will be settled is important. Can complicate tax returns: Because you are buying fractional shares, and may buy several fractional shares throughout the year, depending on your investment strategy, you may end up holding several different tax lots that may be difficult to match up at tax time. If a stock you own has a dividend that you automatically reinvest, you will have additional tax lots to deal with. Selection of stocks and ETFs available for fractional share investing: Because each online brokerage has its own select list of stocks or ETFs that they offer for fractional share investing, it is important to know this ahead of time. Some firms will offer ETFs, others will not. One company may offer fractional shares of an individual company, while others may not. Be sure to check out each brokerage\u2019s list of fractional share stocks and ETF offerings before opening an account. Fees and commissions: Some brokerages will be commission-free when it comes to investing in fractional shares, while others may charge additional fees. It is important to find out the brokerage\u2019s policy on this prior to opening an account. Account minimums: Many companies have no account minimum to open or maintain the account. Often, investors can buy fractional shares for as low as $1. Balance and investment minimums will differ from broker to broker. Research amenities: Once you open an account with an online broker or robo-advisor, you will have access to research amenities. Brokers will provide analysts\u2019 assessments of companies, which can help you determine which stocks you\u2019d like to invest in. Educational content: Knowing how to invest, what to invest in, and how to reach your financial goals are important. Educational content provided by your brokerage can help you to better understand which investments will help you reach your goals, and even how to better utilize your account amenities to track and monitor your investment. Fractional shares are very simply a portion, or fraction, of a whole share. When investing in fractional shares, you will buy a portion of a stock share. With this strategy, you are investing based on a dollar amount, not an individual stock\u2019s price or a certain number of shares. Buying fractional shares provides investors with a lower entry point of accessibility, thereby allowing investors to gain market entry sooner. While the concept of trading in fractional shares has been around since 1999, the strategy really wasn\u2019t widely available\u2014or financially feasible\u2014until 2019. A few low-fee companies offered fractional shares at that time, but this didn\u2019t last very long. Around 2019, online brokers cut fees drastically to offer low fees or no monthly fees, thus creating a path for investing in fractional shares to become advantageous. Prior to 2019, your portfolio may have had fractional shares, but it was most likely due to a few, limited circumstances: owning mutual funds, stock splits, dividend reinvestment programs, or company mergers or acquisitions. Your experience with investing in fractional shares will differ depending on which brokerage you decide to invest through. Each brokerage has its own guidelines, so finding out exactly what is offered will be important before deciding to invest. For example: If you are only buying a fraction of a share, you will also only get a fraction of the dividend, if the stock receives one. For example, if you want to invest in a stock that is trading at $100 per share, you don\u2019t need to have $100 to buy a full share, you can instead invest $25 and own one-fourth of a share. If this same stock happens to get a dividend that is $0.40 per share, you would likewise get one-fourth of the dividend, or $0.10. One online brokerage that offers fractional shares is Charles Schwab. Schwab refers to a fractional share as a \u201cslice.\u201d When buying a Schwab stock slice, investors have the choice to buy slices of 30 stocks in companies on the S&P 500 in one transaction. These shares can then be held and sold independently. One way to think of it is like investing in a mutual fund, but you have the flexibility to trade the individual stocks, or stock fractions. Buying fractional shares can be beneficial in several ways: affordability, diversification, and dollar cost averaging. Affordability: You don\u2019t have to wait until you have hundreds or thousands of dollars in order to buy enough shares of a stock. You can start investing with many online brokerages in fractional shares with only $1. Diversification: Investing lower dollar amounts and being able to diversify used to only be available in mutual funds. However, now that many brokerages offer fractional shares, investors can choose which companies they want to invest in, and can trade the fractional shares at any time\u2014unlike a mutual fund, which is bought and sold as a \u201cbasket\u201d of stocks. Having the option to only invest in a fractional share allows investors to choose several stocks rather than putting all of their money into just one company in order to purchase a certain amount of whole shares. Dollar cost averaging: Because investing in fractional shares is an option, investors can choose to pick a specific dollar amount to invest each month, for instance. By investing on a regular basis, investors can take advantage of price fluctuations in the market while also hedging against risk. Yes, you can buy fractional shares through Fidelity. With a minimum account balance of $0, and fractional share investing starting at only $1, Fidelity makes it easy to open an account and start investing in fractional shares. In fact, Investopedia ranks Fidelity as the Best Online Broker for ETFs, so if investing in fractional shares of ETFs is important to you, this company may be a great option. In all, Fidelity offers over 7,000 US stocks and ETFs in which investors can buy fractional shares. Investing in such small dollar amounts may not seem like a way to make money. If you treat this like contributing to an IRA or 401k on a monthly basis, though, your multiple, small investments will add up over time and create a very nice savings account. While one individual purchase is only buying a portion of a stock, or portions of several stocks, investing over months or years will allow those fractional shares to keep building, potentially into several full shares of several stocks. Yes, some companies will offer ETFs as fractional shares. Because each brokerage has different fractional share offerings, it is important to find out if the firm you want to invest with offers ETFs as fractional shares and what other stocks are on its fractional share list. The answer to this will depend upon how your brokerage handles the selling of fractional shares. Some brokerage firms do not guarantee liquidity of fractional shares. This will differ from broker to broker, so it is something to consider when choosing which firm you want to invest with. Liquidity refers to the ability to easily sell a stock or security and convert to cash. Even though you can buy fractional shares, you may not be able to sell fractional portions as easily as whole shares.

Learn what it takes to automate your investing Automated investing might be the smartest way to simplify wealth-building. By automating your investing you\u2019re less likely to miss funds as they are withdrawn from your paycheck and\u00a0 transferred directly into your 401(k) or an investment account. From beginners to sophisticated options traders, automated investing is a crucial strategy to compound investment growth. We\u2019ve designed this guide to help you explore the ways to automate your investing from simply reinvesting dividends to regular transfers into a robo-advisor. It\u2019s usually quick and easy to automate your investing. Before setting up the account, review the platform\u2019s FAQ pages for the range of account minimums and potential approvals needed to open an automated investing account. Each platform will have its own process. Next, gather your bank account and personal information, such as your Social Security number. The investment account platform will walk you through the process step-by-step. Here\u2019s what you can expect when setting up your automated investing account: You can set up an automated investment plan in a variety of ways. From robo-advisors to your employer 401(k), we\u2019ll give you the rundown. Choose one or more automated investment types to ensure that you are converting today\u2019s earnings into wealth for tomorrow. First, find out what information is required to open an automated investing account. The personal information and documentation required to complete the onboarding process typically includes: Fortunately for investors, there are many automated investment accounts with low-minimum deposit requirements. Minimum deposits can range from zero for many well-known investment brokerage firms up to $100,000 for the comprehensive Empower robo-advisor, which also includes access to certified financial planners. If you are new to investing and just starting out, you might open your automated investing account at a major brokerage firm that doesn\u2019t require a minimum investment, such as Fidelity Go. Or, if you\u2019re seeking a robo-advisor with low minimums, SoFi Automated Investing, M1 Finance, Betterment, Ally, and Ellevest all require $100 or less to get started. With so many choices about how to automate investing, it can be confusing to narrow down your selection. To make the decision easier, evaluate these factors: Customer service: Phone customer service can be very important for both new and experienced investors. Be aware that some platforms do not offer live customer service. If talking to a human matters to you, then look into live customer service availability and contact times. Fees and commissions: Research from Vanguard and other firms has shown a direct correlation between lower fees and higher investment performance. Before investing with any platform, understand the fees you\u2019ll be paying, including management fees and fund expense ratios. Determine whether the services you\u2019re receiving are worth the fees. Account minimum: Investigate how much money you\u2019ll need to open the account as well as maintain it. Determine whether there is a minimum balance requirement and if it is suitable for your financial situation. Research tools: For self-directed investment accounts, carefully review the screeners, calculators, trading platforms, and research report availability. If you\u2019re a self-directed investor, make certain, before opening an account, that the research tools match up with your needs. Automated investing is a strategy to ensure that you regularly save and invest for the future. We all have the tendency to forget to implement our best intentions. New Year's resolutions are frequently forgotten by February. Automated investing pre-programs our behavior to put investing for the future first. Automated investing is best for anyone interested in converting today's earnings into tomorrow's prosperity. This strategy works when saving for retirement, a child's college education, general wealth-building, and saving for any goal that is more than five years in the future. The automated investment concept involves implementing a few simple steps. First, select a paycheck, personal checking, or savings account from which the investment funds will be drawn. Next, choose where you want to invest. The choices include your workplace retirement account, a self-directed investment account, a micro-investing app, or a robo-advisor. Reinvesting your dividends and capital gains within your brokerage account is also considered automated investing. Pick the specific investments, and then set up a regular transfer from the cash account into the investment account. Finally, you choose the amount and frequency of your auto investment strategy. Once the plan is enacted, your money will automatically transfer into the designated accounts and investments. That way, when markets go down, you\u2019ll be less tempted to stop investing, because the entire process is automated. In fact, when markets go down, you\u2019ll be set up to benefit from one of the best investment tenets: \u201cBuy low.\u201d Think of automated investing like automated bill pay. You set up the parameters, such as amount to be invested, the investment vehicles, and the funding method. After setup, regular transfers from your bank account or paycheck go directly to your investment accounts.\u00a0This automates the contributions to your investment account. If you have a self-directed account, you may have another step to them put that money to work. Often this can be eliminated if you are buying into pre-built portfolios offered by your brokerage. You can also automate the investment portfolio through a robo-advisor where the contributions will automatically be invested according to the allocations and rules that were created as part of your account setup. Automated investing is a good idea for nearly everyone. Behavioral finance research suggests that we are not always rational decision-makers. By helping you overcome less optimal investment behavior, such as irregular investing or avoiding investment, automated investing can improve your long-term financial success. Automated investing removes money from your account before you can spend it and diverts it into long-term financial assets, leading to wealth-building, Investing in financial markets is risky in that the value of your initial investment can decline. In fact, automated investing might be considered less risky than do-it-yourself investing. By regularly deploying money into the financial markets during both up and down markets, you are practicing dollar-cost-averaging. This ensures that you will buy more shares when prices are lower and fewer shares when prices are higher. This is the \u201cbuy low\u201d recommendation in action. Micro-investing apps have their pros and cons. The benefit of these round-up investment apps is that you can get started and continue investing regularly. The disadvantage is that if you only invest your spare change and do not set up a larger automated deposit into the app, it will take you a long time to build a substantial account balance. For example, assume that monthly, you invest $50 in spare change into your investment account, which earns an average 7% per year. After 10 years, that account will be worth $8,704. Now add in a $350 monthly auto deposit in addition to the $50 spare change investment and you\u2019re investing $400 per month. With an average 7% annual return, your account will grow to roughly $69,637 in 10 years. Yes, there are multiple reasons to use an automated investing platform. Anyone serious about planning for their future would be wise to consider setting up automated investment strategies.

Learn the best ways to earn passive income and build wealth Bus\u00c3\u00a0 Photography / Getty Images The best ways to earn passive income aren\u2019t only the purview of the wealthy. With a modicum of startup time and capital, anyone can create a passive income stream. Whether you have a full-time job or are a retiree seeking extra cash, passive income ideas are available to increase your cash flow. Passive income isn\u2019t literally money without effort, but more akin to money with less effort. Some passive income strategies, like owning dividend-paying stocks or bonds, require less work than owning rental real estate. This guide covers how to get started, how much passive income you can earn, the required effort, and various passive income investments. 15 Passive Income Ideas: There are scores of passive income sources and ways to start earning passive income. Before you begin, you\u2019ll need to figure out how much effort and money you want to expend. Then choose a passive income idea that fits your capital, skills, and interests. Step 1: Choose passive income streams. Decide whether you want to invest for passive income or run a side gig that generates some cash. Either way, it typically takes some time to build up a decent cash flow. Step 2: Choose the platform that fits your needs. If you\u2019re seeking passive investment income, there are many financial brokerage firms, mobile investment apps, and banks that will suffice. However, there are other measures you can consider. For instance, you can learn how to make passive income online by selling products and services. With a social media account like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, or a website, you can market products and services quite effectively. These are among the best ways to earn passive income, and the required effort is greater in the beginning and diminishes as time passes. Step 3: Set your expectations. Earning passive income from investing involves predicting your return based upon the investment amount. A $5,000 investment in a dividend fund that pays a 6% yield will provide $300 per year, while successful affiliate websites might earn $1,000 per month or more. The best passive income opportunities often involve balancing human capital, financial capital, and time. Investing in financial markets involves banking and financial products like stocks and bonds. Buying banking products like certificates of deposit and high-yield cash accounts is less risky, but has lower upside potential than investing in financial market assets. Passive investing in dividend-paying stocks or interest-paying bonds provides cash flow but requires a larger investment to realize meaningful monthly income. Crowdfunding investment apps also enable the public to buy shares in farmland, large and small real estate projects, wine, art, and more to receive ongoing cash flow. There is a range of risk levels when investing in financial assets. The lowest-risk cash flow-producing assets are money market mutual funds, high-yield savings accounts, and bank certificates of deposit. Investing in dividend-paying stocks or stock funds carries the risk that the dividend will be cut and also that the principal value of the investment might fall. Interest-paying bonds and bond funds will vary in price as well, but the interest payments are rarely cut. Individual bonds, held until maturity, will return the par or full value of the investment. But bonds sold before maturity and bond funds might be sold for less, or more, than your original payment amount. Crowdfunding apps that invest in real estate, farmland, startups, art, wine, and more carry additional risks. Many require long lockup periods before you can withdraw your money. Others are not as closely regulated as traditional financial assets. With newer platforms, there is a greater chance of asset defaults and business closures. Buying dividend-paying stocks is a path to owning a portion of a publicly traded company. Many stocks pay a portion of their earnings to shareholders in the form of cash dividends, which are usually paid quarterly. You have the option to reinvest the cash payment in additional shares of stock or to take the cash dividend payment. Long-term investors who build up a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks or funds have one of the best ways to earn passive income.\u00a0Investing in dividend-paying stocks is a passive income idea with both cash flow and capital growth potential. A dividend exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle that owns many dividend-paying stocks. You can buy one investment, such as the SPDR S&P Global Dividend ETF (WDIV), and receive access to a portfolio of dividend-paying companies. The WDIV ETF owns global companies that frequently pay higher dividends than U.S. firms. Many dividend ETFs also screen for companies with a history of increasing dividends. The dividend ETF is another passive income investment that provides regular cash payments along with an added bonus of capital appreciation potential. Consider management fees when choosing a dividend exchange-traded fund, as higher fund fees can detract from returns. Bonds are back in favor as interest rates are higher than they\u2019ve been in decades. Unlike stocks, bond investments are loans that you make to a company or government entity. In exchange for the loan, you receive regular coupon interest payments. Bonds are among the best ways to earn passive income because if you buy a newly issued bond at par, usually $1,000, and hold it until maturity, you\u2019ll receive regular cash interest payments and a return of principal at the bond's maturity. Bonds with lower credit ratings typically provide higher interest payments and greater cash flow, while government bonds and highly rated corporate bonds will offer lower interest payments. Bond values can rise and fall, so you might receive more or less than your initial price, should you sell before maturity. The bond\u2019s credit rating suggests the bond\u2019s likelihood of default, with lower-rated bonds carrying a higher risk of default. Investors can also invest in diversified bond mutual or exchange-traded funds to build passive income without lifting a finger. Bundle together a group of individual bonds, and you have a bond fund. With differing bond maturities and investment styles, there are multiple ways to generate passive income with bond funds. Those comfortable with a risky asset can purchase a high-yield bond fund like the SPDR Blmbg ST HY Bd ETF (SJNK), which has a current 7.05% SEC yield. More conservative investors can buy a diversified government bond fund and receive regular interest payments that are exempt from state and local taxes.\u00a0Unlike buying an individual bond, both the coupon or interest payment and the fund value will vary. Certificates of deposit (CDs) are banking products that you can buy at most financial institutions. You invest a specific amount of money, typically $100 or more, and leave the money invested for a period of time. CDs typically pay a pre-specified interest rate and are usually issued for terms from three months to five years or more. There are a variety of CD types, including fixed and floating variable interest rates. Investors seeking regular cash flow and a stable principal value can create a CD ladder and buy CDs at regular intervals. As one CD comes due, you reinvest the proceeds in a new certificate of deposit. Ladders are among the best passive income investments to increase cash flow when you expect interest rates to rise. A bank high-yield savings account pays higher interest payments than a typical savings account. The required minimum balance can be greater than that of a savings account. If you\u2019re wondering how to make passive income, a high-yield savings account is a good choice. For passive income from money that you need for near-term expenses and emergencies, a high-yield savings account is a sound choice and keeps your funds liquid. The process of opening a high-yield savings account is similar to opening a traditional bank account. Simply click on the \u201copen an account\u201d button on your preferred bank\u2019s website and answer several personal questions, such as address, Social Security number, and type of account. To verify your identity, you might need to supply prior addresses, debts, and employment details. A money market mutual fund is an investment vehicle that owns short-term commercial debt. This investment is distinct from a money market bank account, which is similar to a high-yield bank savings account. Like a typical mutual fund, money from many investors is pooled to invest in short-term debt and cash-equivalent instruments. The allure of these accounts is that the share value is pegged at one dollar, and yields are among the highest of the high-yield cash equivalent group. You\u2019ll need to invest in a money market fund within an investment brokerage account. These investments are liquid, and the money can be withdrawn within a few days. The interest from money market funds can be withdrawn for cash flow or reinvested to grow for the future. You\u2019ll find a laundry list of alternatives to stock, bond, and cash passive income ideas. Some of these choices are more passive than others. Real estate investing is frequently touted as a response to the question, \u201cWhat is the best way to earn passive income?\u201d But real estate investing takes many forms, and requires varying amounts of effort. Owning and managing real property requires a chunk of capital and is a passive endeavor until a pipe breaks or the renter doesn\u2019t pay their rent. Then it is a lot of work. Real estate crowdfunding apps or investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs) are more passive. Once you purchase the securities, you wait for the cash flow. Another popular way to earn passive income online is by creating an affiliate website, but this involves more work than meets the eye. An Airbnb rental is only semi-passive if you hire a team to manage the property. Cash-back credit cards and shopping sites might be considered a passive income idea, yet you\u2019re spending in order to receive the cash. That\u2019s not a net-positive endeavor. Other alternatives to passive income involve digital property sales, like e-books, courses, apps, and other online goods. For all of these passive income ideas, there is a hefty startup time commitment and some upfront cash as well. You\u2019re also less certain of receiving a return on your investment if the sales miss expectations. Evaluate these alternatives to passive income to learn whether there's a strategy for you. A real estate investment trust or REIT is an investment vehicle that owns a pool of commercial real estate. There are REITs that provide broad diversification across the real estate landscape. Or you can buy niche REITs that own senior housing, student housing, warehouses, commercial property, mortgages, shopping malls, data centers or many other varieties of property. The benefit of REITs for cash flow is that they are required by law to pay out 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. Debt investing is popular, with many platforms that enable everyday investors to be the bank and lend money to others. Peer-to-peer lending offers various types of loans for various reasons. Platforms match borrowers with lenders for various cash needs. These peer-to-peer lending apps offer higher interest payments than other traditional stock, bond, or cash vehicles. But they are riskier as potential loan payment defaults can eat into your returns. To minimize that risk, you can choose to invest in higher-quality loans and diversify by owning many loans. Real estate crowdfunding allows investors to finance real estate projects through online platforms with the goal of profiting either from capital appreciation or passive income. There are a range of real estate crowdfunding websites offering small to large investors an entry into commercial, industrial, single-family, and apartment building investing. Fundrise is our 2024 best real estate crowdfunding website. It provides investment access to real estate and startup venture capital funding with only a $10 minimum. Real estate crowdfunding can deliver a higher interest rate than REITs, but it has less liquidity, less government oversight, and a greater risk of default. Real estate debt or note investing puts you in a banker's seat. You lend money to those seeking to buy new real estate, remodel existing property, fix and flip, and a variety of other types of real estate investors. Apps like Groundfloor provide investors the opportunity to lend to real estate buyers. The allure of lending to real estate borrowers is that your investment is secured by real property. Some of the larger real estate crowdfunding apps also deliver real estate note investing. A drawback to real estate note investing also makes it one of the best investments for passive income. Unlike publicly traded securities, you can\u2019t immediately redeem your shares, but may need to wait several months or more for a return of your principal investment. The lack of liquidity can also lead to higher investment returns. Affiliate marketers sell products and services on their websites or social media accounts and receive a commission from the brand for the sale. Affiliate marketers frequently write reviews to draw visitors to their websites. The setup for affiliate marketing is not passive and involves creating a website or social media platform, developing contracts with companies who pay affiliates, and creating content to draw visitors to the website. The passive aspect of affiliate marketing is that once the content is written and a website develops a stream of visitors, your work is diminished. That\u2019s only partially true, as you\u2019ll need to write new content and update old content in order to maintain and increase website traffic. Additionally, it can take months or more to begin to generate cash flow. We place affiliate marketing on the higher-effort step of the passive income ideas ladder. Creating digital products or content, such as online courses, is among the best ways to earn passive income online. Similar to affiliate marketing, you\u2019ll sell your digital products online through a variety of outlets, such as an Etsy store, social media platform, YouTube, or a website. Align your digital products with your area of expertise. Sample types of digital products include printouts, e-courses, e-books, webinars, and more. This is not the best passive income idea for beginners with limited free time. Making passive income with digital product sales initially requires market analysis, product creation, and marketing before realizing decent passive income flow. Drivers with cars can get paid to wrap their cars in advertisement banners. We found firms that paid from $100 to $500 per month just for driving with an advertisement on their car. For anyone wondering, \u201cWhat is the simplest way to make passive income?\u201d Car wrapping is not without its limitations. Car wrapping scams exist and, unfortunately, are abundant in the industry. Don\u2019t pay money upfront for access to advertise with car wrapping. You\u2019ll also need to accept the advertiser's stipulations of mileage, and other factors. Finally, making passive income by advertising on your car means that you need to drive around with an ad on your car. To put this in perspective, the ad can be simply placed on the door or hood of your car, or it can be wrapped around the entire vehicle. Make sure you understand what\u2019s needed before signing a binding contract. Creating an online store with drop shipping can answer the question, \u201cHow can I passively make $1,000 a month?\u201d After setting up your product inventory, payment system, and marketing strategy, drop shipping is among the simplest ways to make money online. Select products from manufacturers or wholesalers and sell them as your own inventory. The supplier handles the inventory and shipping, so you can grow your brand and market the shop. Like most passive online income strategies, after setting up the business, you\u2019ll need to devote a lot of time to marketing. You can market your store through a website and/or social media. Once you\u2019re up and running, with brand recognition and customers, maintaining an online store with drop shipping is a good form of passive income. All passive income ideas require startup capital. To develop a meaningful passive income stream from financial assets like cash equivalents, stocks, and bonds, you\u2019ll need a decent account balance. With $100,000, an investment paying a 5% dividend or interest payment provides $5,000 per year cash flow. Although affiliate marketing requires a small cash outlay to potentially obtain cash flow, you\u2019ll pay more with your human capital or time. All investments carry a degree of risk. Certificates of deposit and high-yield cash investments don\u2019t risk the principal value of your investment, but they could lose purchasing power over time due to inflation. Investing in higher-risk dividend-paying financial assets involves the potential to lose principal and decrease cash flow should dividends be cut. Crowdfunding passive income investments are less regulated and can tie up your money for longer periods with added risks of defaults and platform failures. With the exception of tax-exempt municipal bonds from your state of residence, all income is taxed by the government. After-tax income is what really matters, so understand how your investment is taxed, and your specific marginal tax bracket. Dividends and interest payments may have their own tax rates. Passive income is money that you earn without much effort. In contrast with earned income, from a job, passive income flows after an initial startup effort and cost to create long-term cash flow. Passive income ideas span low-effort activities such as buying a high dividend bond fund to creating online businesses that require an initial startup effort which becomes less labor-intensive over time. There is a fine line between active and passive income. Clearly, going to work every day in exchange for a regular paycheck is active income. Task work such as food delivery, rideshare driving, freelance jobs, consulting, and contract work are also ways to create active income. With active income, you get paid for working. Passive income ideas span a range of jobs that require less effort than active income. Receiving income in exchange for zero effort is unlikely unless you count receiving an inheritance or winning the lottery. Writing a book and then receiving royalties is a great example of passive income, yet with the passage of time, book royalties will decline. In contrast, if you buy a dividend-paying stock fund, once you select the investment, you will receive ongoing dividend payments without much additional effort. Some passive income ideas are liquid, like buying dividend-paying investments, while others are less liquid, like long-term real estate syndications. Some passive income jobs require minor ongoing work in exchange for cash flow, while others are less passive and involve greater ongoing effort. Passive income strategies range from those with a small startup effort, like investing in dividend-paying stock or money market mutual funds, to more labor-intensive ones, such as managing rental properties or creating an affiliate marketing review website. By creating digital products like courses, apps, e-books, and more and selling them, you can create passive income with minimal cash. Books can be sold on digital marketplaces like Amazon, while you can sell other products through your social media accounts or an online store. While you don\u2019t need a lot of cash to create digital products, you need time and effort to market and sell them. If you have a job with a 401(k) or other retirement account, you can contribute part of your paycheck to that account and invest in financial assets. At retirement, you\u2019ll have enough money to create a passive income stream. Yes, you can live off of passive income. It\u2019s easiest to live off of passive income if you live in an area with a low cost of living. To live off of financial investment and cash-equivalent income, you\u2019ll need a larger amount of money. To earn $30,000 per year, you\u2019ll need $600,000 invested at 5% per year. To live off of digital product or service sales, you\u2019ll need to earn several thousand dollars per month. The same goes for affiliate marketing. Older individuals who have built up a large amount of investable assets are most likely to be able to live off of passive income. The exceptions are those who\u2019ve made a lot of money early in life, live simply, and invest for income and capital growth. To pick the right passive income idea, assess your available time, risk tolerance level, and available capital. Also, explore your skill sets to determine which passive income ideas are a good fit for you. The easiest way to start investing for future passive income is to start small and automate your investing. Everyone should consider investing for the future. When you are older, it\u2019s easier to create a passive income stream with investing. Younger individuals with ambition and the ability to motivate themselves are wise to consider creating passive income streams through online stores and creating digital products. Employment is uncertain, and creating multiple streams of income is a sound financial plan. Yes, all income is taxable. Earned income is taxed at the federal, state, and local level. You\u2019ll also pay self-employment tax with earned self-employment income. Investment income has its own tax considerations. While real estate can be taxed in various ways. To understand how passive income is taxed, it\u2019s wise to visit the IRS website for more details. Online tax software programs such as Turbo Tax can help you estimate the tax you\u2019ll pay on passive income. While passive income won\u2019t impact the amount of your Social Security benefit, it can affect the amount of tax you\u2019re required to pay.\u00a0 Up to 85% of your Social Security benefits can be taxed. Like all IRS regulations, there is a list of criteria to determine the impact of your passive income on the taxation of your Social Security benefits. Visit the SSA.gov website to understand how your passive income could impact the taxation of your Social Security benefits. Teenagers have many money-making ideas available to them. Unless you have access to a large sum of money, earning passive income through investing in dividend-paying assets is unlikely. Creating an online business as a teenager is a potential path to future passive income. Starting an online store, selling digital products, creating an e-course, or writing product reviews are all paths to ultimately making passive income as a teenager. Teenagers can promote their businesses online through a website and/or social media accounts. These beginner passive income ideas require substantial startup effort and a modicum of long-term maintenance.

            "title": "Best Commodities ETFs",
            "content": "UGA, BNO, and DBE are the best commodities ETFs The three top-performing commodity funds have risen as much as 47% in the past year by offering exposure to energy prices as oil remains at its highest in eight years. They are the U.S. Gasoline Fund, the U.S States Brent Oil Fund, and the Invesco DB Energy Fund, which targets futures contracts commodities including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and heating oil. The ETFs provide exposure to physical commodities, not commodity-producing companies. Some 50 commodities ETFs trade in the U.S., excluding inverse and leveraged funds as well as those with less than $50 million in assets under management (AUM). The leading ETFs have outperformed the S&P 500 Index's drop of 19% in the last year as well as the 19% gains of the Dow Jones Commodity Index, as of Nov. 9. While some commodities prices, such as oil and gas, are down from highs earlier in 2022, the Chinese government's recent easing of COVID restrictions in the world's second-largest economy has boosted prices again. We examine the top three commodities ETFs below. All numbers below are as of Nov. 10. UGA is structured as a commodity pool, a private investment structure that groups investor contributions in order to trade futures and options in commodities. It's designed to track the movements of gasoline prices. The ETF offers investors a way to bet on a rise in gasoline prices by investing in futures contracts on\u00a0reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending (RBOB) and other gasoline-related futures. The fund may also invest in\u00a0forwards\u00a0and\u00a0swap\u00a0contracts. It provides investors with a way to implement a short-term tactical tilt toward a specific segment of the energy market and isn't likely to appeal to those building a long-term,\u00a0buy-and-hold\u00a0portfolio. BNO is also structured as a commodity pool. BNO's aim is that daily percentage changes in its shares' net asset value (NAV) are mirrored in fluctuations in the spot price of Brent Crude oil. That price is measured by movements in the price of the BNO's Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. The ETF's benchmark is a near-month futures contract traded on the ICE Futures Exchange. Because Brent Crude often trades at a different price from West Texas Intermediate (WTI), BNO can be a useful way of gaining alternative exposure. Its primary holdings are Brent Crude oil futures contracts. BNO may also invest in forwards and swap contracts. Like the other two funds, DBE is also structured as a commodity pool. It invests in futures contracts of some of the most heavily traded commodities in the world, including light sweet crude oil (WTI), heating oil, Brent crude oil, RBOB gasoline, and natural gas. Its goal is to track changes in the DBIQ Optimum Yield Energy Index Excess Return, which includes futures contracts on heavily traded energy commodities. The fund provides a cost-effective and convenient way for investors to gain exposure to futures of energy commodities. However, it may not be suitable for all investors, as the fund is focused on investments within highly volatile markets.

            "title": "2 Auto ETFs for Q4 2022",
            "content": "CARZ and VCAR are two auto ETFs for Q4 2022 The auto industry includes companies that manufacture cars, trucks, vans, and commercial vehicles, as well as companies that supply automobile parts and technology. Well-known names in the industry include Tesla Inc. (TSLA), now the world\u2019s largest automaker by market value, Ford Motor Co. (F), Toyota Motor Corp. (TM), and General Motors Co. (GM). Investors looking to invest in a specific industry can typically do so by using an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on that area. An ETF allows investors to hold a basket of stocks operating within a specific industry, thus avoiding the idiosyncratic risk of investing in a single stock. But that's no longer the case when it comes to autos. As of this year, there is no pure-play ETF specifically devoted to the auto industry. That's because CARZ, the closest thing to a pure-play auto ETF, recently changed its investment objective and is now less focused on the industry. In January of 2022, the previously named First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund changed its investment objective to focus on companies primarily involved in three areas: the development and sales of electric and autonomous vehicles, future auto technologies and products, and related technologies. It also changed the index that it tracks and is now called the First Trust S-Network Future Vehicles & Technology ETF (CARZ). It is the closest thing to an auto ETF that trades in the U.S., excluding inverse and leveraged funds as well as those with less than $50 million in assets under management (AUM). In addition to CARZ, a newer auto-focused fund, called the Simplify Volt RoboCar Disruption and Tech ETF (VCAR), provides targeted exposure to a certain portion of the auto industry. The automobile industry, as represented by the benchmark S&P 500 Automobiles Industry Index, has outperformed the broader market in the past year. The index has provided a one-year trailing total return of 10.7%, compared with -10.6% for the S&P 500. We note that this index includes only U.S. companies, while CARZ and VCAR each have a global focus. As mentioned, both of these funds are not pure-play auto industry ETFs. The performance figures above and all data below are as of Sept. 7, 2022. In order to focus on the funds' investment strategy, the top holdings listed for each ETF exclude cash holdings and holdings purchased with securities lending proceeds except under unusual cases, such as when the cash portion is exceptionally large. ETFs with very low assets under management\u2014less than $50 million\u2014usually have lower liquidity than larger ETFs. This can result in higher trading costs that can negate some of your investment gains or increase your losses. CARZ tracks the S-Network Electric & Future Vehicle Ecosystem Index, which targets companies operating in the electric and future vehicle ecosystem. That includes companies involved in manufacturing electric and autonomous vehicles or providing enabling technologies and materials for the manufacturing process. It also includes companies developing and manufacturing future automotive technology and products or companies providing information technology solutions.

            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. There is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for everything. With each year, the axiom proves ever more true. ETFs have exploded in number, the field-grown crowded with thousands of investment options. Each fund aims to offer a low-cost portfolio of assets, often linked together by theme, trend or other commonality. Investors worried about climate change or cruelty to animals or both now have an ETF that caters to this theme: the U.S. Vegan Climate ETF (VEGN). The fund is provided by Beyond Investing and Beyond Advisors IC. Beyond Investing lists a Florida mailbox as its address, while Beyond Advisors IC is based in Jersey. According to the fund's prospectus, it aims to \"address the concerns of vegans, animal lovers, and environmentalists by avoiding investments in companies whose activities directly contribute to animal suffering, destruction of the natural environment, and climate change.\" This puts the U.S. Vegan Climate ETF in a growing class of socially responsible funds. To find index members, the U.S. Vegan Climate ETF starts with the Solactive U.S. Large Cap Index, which consists of approximately 500 companies. From there, the fund removes any company involved with animal testing, animal-derived products, animal farming, and animals used in sports or entertainment. Also excluded are fossil fuel companies, those that burn fossil fuels for energy production, and any company with a significant carbon footprint or history of environmental destruction. Tobacco, military, and defense companies are eliminated, along with companies tied to human rights abuses. As of September 30, 2023, the U.S. Vegan Climate ETF held 248 companies weighted by market capitalization. Top holdings include NVIDIA (NVDA), TESLA (TSLA), and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). The fund held approximately $80.74 million in assets as of December 11, 2023. A three-person team is responsible for curating the fund. They have prior ETF experience at Charles Schwab, BlackRock, and State Street. As is often the case with vegan alternatives to traditional products and services, investors can expect to pay a premium for their investment in the U.S. Vegan Climate ETF. The expense ratio is 0.60%, compared with an average cost of 0.39% for socially responsible ETFs. Still, the focus on social responsibility is enough to draw many eager investors, including a high proportion of millennial investors looking to reap the rewards of investing without compromising their values. About 207 socially responsible ETFs collectively hold assets of approximately $94 billion, showing that investors as a group take this approach quite seriously.

            "title": "How Do ETF Dividends Work?",
            "content": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). One of the ways that investors make money from exchange traded funds (ETFs) is through dividends that are paid to the ETF issuer and then paid on to their investors in proportion to the number of shares each holds. If you're looking for an ETF that pays a steady stream of income, you might consider one of the many ETFs that focus on investments that historically have paid high dividends. ETF issuers decide whether to pay these dividends directly or reinvest them in the fund. The fund prospectus makes it clear which it is. Like any company that issues a stock dividend, an ETF's sponsor sets an ex-dividend date, a record date, and a payment date. These dates determine who will receive the dividend and when it will be paid. The timing of these dividend payments is on a different schedule than those of the underlying stocks and is set by the ETF sponsor. For example, the ex-dividend date for the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is the third Friday of the final month of a fiscal quarter (March, June, September, and December). If that date is not a business day, the ex-dividend date falls on the prior business day. The record date comes two days prior to the ex-dividend date. At the end of each quarter, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF distributes the dividends. These dates are listed in the fund's prospectus, which is publicly available to all investors. Just as like any stock shares, the price of an ETF often rises before the ex-dividend date\u2014reflecting a flurry of buying activity\u2014and falls afterward, as\u00a0investors who own the fund before the ex-dividend date receive the dividend, and those buying afterward do not. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF pays out dividends in cash. According to the fund\u2019s prospectus, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF puts all dividends it receives from its underlying stock holdings into a non-interest-bearing account until it comes time to make a payout. At the end of the fiscal quarter, when dividends are due to be paid, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF pulls the dividends from the non-interest-bearing account and distributes them proportionally to the investors. Some ETFs may temporarily reinvest the dividends from the underlying stocks into the holdings of the fund until it comes time to make a cash dividend payment. Naturally, this creates a small amount of leverage in the fund, which can slightly improve its performance during bull markets and slightly harm its performance during bear markets. ETF managers also have the option of reinvesting investors' dividends into the ETF rather than distributing them as cash. The payout to shareholders is accomplished through reinvestment in the ETF's underlying index on their behalf. Essentially, it comes out to the same amount:\u00a0An ETF shareholder who receives a 2% dividend reinvestment from an ETF can sell those shares and take the cash. These reinvestments can be seen as a benefit, as it does not cost the investor a trade fee to purchase the additional shares through the dividend reinvestment. However, each shareholder's annual dividends are taxable in the year they are received, even if they are received via dividend reinvestment. ETFs are often viewed as a favorable alternative to mutual funds in terms of their ability to control the amount and timing of income tax to the investor. However, this is primarily due to how and when the taxable capital gains are captured in ETFs. Owning dividend-producing ETFs does not defer the tax on the dividends paid by an ETF during a tax year. The dividends that an ETF pays are taxable to the investor in essentially the same way as the dividends paid by a mutual fund are taxable. Here are five popular dividend-orientated ETFs. The\u00a0SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY)\u00a0is the most extreme and exclusive of the dividend ETFs. It\u00a0tracks the S&P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes companies in the S&P Composite 1500 that have increased their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years. Due to their long history of reliably paying these dividends, these companies are often considered less risky for investors seeking total return. The\u00a0Vanguard\u00a0Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) tracks the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index, a\u00a0market capitalization-weighted grouping of companies that have increased dividends for a minimum of ten consecutive years. Its assets are invested domestically, and the\u00a0portfolio includes many companies known for paying rich dividends, such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) is the largest ETF to track a dividend-weighted index. Similar to VIG, this ETF invests in U.S. companies but the focus is on smaller companies. Roughly one-quarter of the 100 stocks in DVY's portfolio are utility companies. Other major sectors represented include financials, consumer staples, energy, and communication stocks. BlackRock's iShares Core High Dividend ETF (HDV) is younger and uses a smaller portfolio than the company's other notable high-yield option, DVY. This ETF tracks a\u00a0Morningstar-constructed index of 75 U.S. stocks screened by dividend sustainability and earnings potential, which are two hallmarks of the Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett school of fundamental analysis. In fact, Morningstar's sustainability ratings are driven by Buffett's concept of an \"economic moat\" that some businesses create to insulate themselves from their rivals. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) is characteristically low-cost and straightforward, like most Vanguard offerings. It tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index\u00a0effectively and demonstrates outstanding tradability for all investor demographics. A particular quirk of the investment strategy for VYM is its focus on companies that pay very high dividends. As a result, this ETF's majority holdings are heavy in the financial and consumer staples sectors. In addition to these five funds, there are\u00a0dividend-focused ETFs that employ various strategies to increase dividend yield. ETFs such as the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF) track a basket of preferred stocks from U.S. companies. The dividend yields on preferred stock ETFs should be substantially more than those of traditional common stock ETFs because preferred stocks behave more like bonds than equities and do not benefit from the appreciation of the company's stock price in the same manner. Real estate investment trust ETFs such as the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ) track publicly traded equity real estate investment trusts (REITS). Due to the nature of REITs, the dividend yields tend to be higher than those of common stock ETFs. There are also international equity ETFs, such as the WisdomTree Emerging Markets High Dividend Fund (DEM)\u00a0or the First Trust Dow Jones Global Select Dividend Index Fund\u00a0(FGD),\u00a0which track higher-than-normal dividend-paying companies domiciled outside of the United States. ETF issuers collect any dividends paid by the companies whose stocks are held in the fund, and they then pay those dividends to their shareholders. They may pay the money directly to the shareholders, or reinvest it in the fund. Not all ETFs earn dividends for their shareholders, and some ETFs are invested primarily in stocks that historically pay high dividends to their shareholders. If you're interested in investing in an ETF that produces regular income that is paid directly to you, check the prospectus to find out whether dividends are paid out to investors or reinvested in the fund. Yes. Dividends paid through an ETF or through a traditional mutual fund are taxed exactly as stock dividends are. The taxes are due in the year that the dividend payment is received, whether the dividend is paid to the shareholder or reinvested in the fund. A dividend is a share in a company's profit for a quarter or a year that is paid to each of its investors. Some companies pay no dividends at all, relying on fast growth in their share prices to attract investors. At the other end of the spectrum, many well-established and profitable companies pay good dividends year after year. Their investors aren't buying and selling their shares to make a fast profit. They're holding onto their shares in order to create a steady stream of income. Although ETFs are best known for tracking broad indexes such as the S&P 500 or the Russell 2000, many ETFs focus on dividend-paying stocks. Historically, dividends have accounted for about 41% of the total returns of the stock market, and a strong dividend payout history is one of the oldest and surest signs of corporate profitability. If your goal is steady income, you might look at one of the many ETFs that focus on dividend-paying companies.

            "content": "J.B. Maverick is an active trader, commodity futures broker, and stock market analyst 17+ years of experience, in addition to 10+ years of experience as a finance writer and book editor. Investors seeking exposure to the driverless car revolution now have the option of buying into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) specifically dedicated to driverless cars, electric vehicles,\u00a0and other innovations in the automobile industry. Among this class of ETFs are KraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility ETF (KARS), which debuted in January of 2018; Capital Link Global Green Energy Transport and Technology Leaders ETF (EKAR); which debuted in February 2018, and Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV), which debuted in April 2018. Prior to the introduction of these specific ETFs, there were no ETFs directly related to self-driving cars and electric vehicles, and only one ETF was focused on the automobile industry. The KraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility ETF (KARS) had $263 million in net assets and a 0.70% expense ratio, as of Aug. 5, 2022. The fund tracks the performance of Bloomberg Electric Vehicles Index, which invests in global companies not only involved with electric vehicle production and/or components. but also \"autonomous driving, shared mobility, lithium and/or copper production, lithium-ion/lead acid batteries, hydrogen fuel cell manufacturing, and electric infrastructure businesses.\" The Capital Link Global Green Energy Transport and Technology Leaders ETF (EKAR) is made up of global stocks related to electric autonomous, or self-driving, vehicles as well as renewable energy/battery storage. The fund invests in companies that fall into five categories within the sector: battery producers, original equipment manufacturers, suppliers, semiconductors and software producers and renewable energy producers. The ETF held a relatively small $7.82 million in net assets with an expense ratio of 0.65% as of Aug. 5, 2022. The fund follows the AF Global Green Energy Transport and Technology Leaders Index. The Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) seeks to correspond to the Solactive Autonomous and Electric Vehicles Index. The fund invests in companies that are involved in the development and manufacturing of software and hardware for driverless vehicles, and companies that produce electric vehicles and their components, such as lithium and cobalt. As of Aug. 5, 2022, the fund had $1.01 billion in net assets and a 0.68% expense ratio. People looking to invest in driverless cars also have the option of adding ETFs to their portfolio that are focused on the automobile industry and related technological innovations. Another indirect to invest in the growth of electric vehicles is to invest in ETFs that track lithium or related stocks. Lithium is a mined element that is a critical component of rechargeable batteries. While Tesla Motors may be the most popular electric car company, many traditional automakers have started selling all-electric vehicles such as GM, Toyota, Hyundai, Ford, and Kia, among others. An all-electric vehicle runs on batteries alone, which are most typically recharged by plugging the vehicle in. A hybrid-electric vehicle, on the other hand, has a gasoline-powered engine along with a small electric motor. The electric motor is recharged by the car's braking system and is put to use to increase overall gas mileage. As of 2022, fewer than 1% of the country\u2019s 250 million vehicles are electric. The Biden Administration, however, has set a goal to increase this figure to at least 50% by the year 2050.

            "title": "Preferred Stock ETFs vs. Bond ETFs: What's the Difference?",
            "content": "Both offer portfolio diversification, liquidity, and low expenses Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 25 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed. Investors in preferred stocks and in corporate bonds have similar motivations. They're looking for a long-term investment with a reasonable and regular return on their money. Today's investors can choose exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on preferred stocks or corporate bonds. Whether you choose one or the other should\u00a0be based\u00a0on the current economic environment as well as\u00a0your investment strategy. From the investor's viewpoint, preferred stocks are a blend of a bond and a stock. Their prices aren't volatile like common stock shares. The point is the dividends these shares pay. They also are considered safer than common stocks. Even in the event of bankruptcy, preferred shareholders are closer to the front of the line for repayment than common shareholders. Preferred stock ETFs give the investor exposure to a range of preferred stocks, thus diversifying your portfolio. Let\u2019s start with a quick look at two of the most popular preferred stock ETFs. Tracks the ICE BofAML Core Plus Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index. Financials as of Dec. 15, 2023. Tracks the S&P U.S. Preferred Stock Index. Financials as of Dec. 15, 2023. The appreciation and high yield for the two preferred stock ETFs above might be tempting, but when interest rates increase they\u2019re not likely to perform as well. Both also performed poorly during the financial crisis, demonstrating a lack of resiliency. A bond is a loan to a corporation in return for a regular payment of interest. As with preferred stocks, the point of bonds, to the investor, is the regular income they generate. All bonds are rated by one of several rating agencies for the creditworthiness of the companies that issue them. The highest-rated bonds may pay the least but are the safest. Low-rated bonds are riskier but pay better. So-called \"junk bonds\" are at high risk of default by their issuers. Tracks the Bloomberg High Yield Very Liquid Index. Financials as of Dec. 15, 2023. Tracks the Bloomberg Long U.S. Treasury Index. Financials as of Dec. 15, 2023. Still, these two choices illustrate the many situations in which yield or lack of it can be deceiving. Most investors chase high yield, not realizing that they\u2019re often putting themselves more at risk for depreciation. A high yield doesn\u2019t mean anything if\u00a0an ETF\u2019s shares slide. That\u2019s the beauty of TLT. The yield might not be extraordinary (still relatively generous), and it tends to appreciate during difficult times because big money rushes to safety. Note that JNK is not a symbol selected for a fund that invests in the highest-quality AAA-rated bonds. Preferred stock ETFs are more appealing in low-interest rate times thanks to their high yields, but they\u2019re not likely to appreciate as much as ETFs tracking common shares during bull markets. Bond ETFs have a reputation for offering greater safety, but it depends on the bond ETF. For instance, JNK offers a high yield, but it\u2019s not a place be during poor economic periods when defaults are more likely. TLT might not offer as much yield, but it offers resiliency and the low expense ratio is a bonus.

            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Exchange-traded funds\u00a0(ETFs)\u00a0are known for being low-cost investments. However, determining the actual price of an ETF can be tricky, in part because there is the net asset value\u00a0(NAV)\u00a0of a fund and its intraday NAV (iNAV), as well as the current market price. The discrepancies between these prices can result in so-called premiums and discounts, which occur when an ETF is trading above or below its NAV, respectively. Sometimes, the charts reflecting premiums and discounts can make it appear as if a customer will encounter a significant change in price when transacting. However, as a 2018 report by FactSet points out, this is most often not the case, as premiums and discounts tend to be short-lived. As an example, the report highlights the MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA). This ETF trades quite closely with its instantaneous fair value: it has an average daily spread of just 0.01%, with daily trades of $1.38 billion. This indicates that the arbitrage\u00a0system for this ETF is working as it should, allowing it to be bought and sold easily. With individuals competing for profit, the ETF's bids and offers remain closely in line with its underlying portfolio value. As a result, it has a one-year median premium of just 0.06%, much of which is due to its 0.04% fee. A minute premium is not necessarily a significant problem for investors, though. Of greater concern is the perception that an ETF like EFA can swing significantly higher and lower than the median, even in the span of just a single day. If it appears possible that the ETF can trade at a discount of more than 3% at the close of one day, only to the leap up to a 2% premium the next day, that is likely to throw investors off. In cases like this, though, there are important factors to keep in mind. An ETF may end the day with its NAV offset from its closing market price, but it can still be trading in line with the value of its underlying portfolio. In situations like this, for instance, the perceived variability between one day's discount and the next day's premium is simply a statistical artifact, as the report indicates. One reason for this is that EFA in particular holds foreign stocks. The fund's accountants have to price out each security to determine NAV. Because security valuation and currency translation do not line up temporally, the NAV ends up being out of date when after-hours trading takes place. The result is a perceived fluctuation in premiums and discounts. For funds synched up with the closing times of the U.S. equity market, this is not an issue. These funds can utilize up-to-the-minute prices for the underlying securities, ensuring no discrepancy. However, for funds like EFA, it's normal to expect some artifact premiums and discounts. It's not just funds with foreign equity that can be affected, either. Those ETFs involved in fixed income, precious metals, non-native currency cash\u00a0and futures also run into the same synchronization problem. Because their NAVs are not up-to-date, they end up reflecting changes to premiums and discounts that are not really there. Bond ETFs in particular run into a problem with regard to the U.S. Treasury market, which closes at 3 p.m. Eastern time. Add to this the fact that some bond ETF NAVs are determined based on the closing bid, not the last traded price, and you have even more reasons why they might appear to trade at a premium or discount. That's not to say that all funds experience phantom premium/discount artifacts, or that all discrepancies of this kind are misleading. It simply means that investors should be aware of those situations in which it may only appear that an ETF experiences widely variable premiums and discounts.

            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Xavier Lorenzo / Getty Images Bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are pools of bitcoin-related assets offered on traditional exchanges by brokerages to be traded as ETFs. The intent behind these ETFs is to give retail and other investors exposure to cryptocurrencies without needing to own them. An exchange-traded fund\u2014a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)\u2014is an investment fund that holds assets and issues securities as shares of the fund which trade on an exchange. ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, providing investors with diversified exposure to various asset classes and the flexibility to buy or sell shares throughout the trading day at market prices. Instead of holding a bunch of different stocks, an investor can simply own shares of one ETF that is invested in those companies. A futures contract is a standardized contract where two parties agree to exchange a specific quantity of a standardized asset on a specific day for a particular price. Bitcoin futures contracts are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. So, a bitcoin futures ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds bitcoin futures contracts and sells shares of the fund to investors. These shares are bought and sold on a mainstream exchange. These ETFs are created by purchasing futures contracts from the CME Group and bundling them into a fund. Next, the company offers shares of the fund to investors. The futures contracts in the fund are then actively managed while the shares are trading. So, instead of trading bitcoin on a cryptocurrency exchange, investors can trade these shares on a traditional exchange and gain exposure. The first concept for an ETF that held bitcoin (not bitcoin futures) emerged shortly after investors and brokers noticed that bitcoin prices were trending upward and gaining popularity amongst investors. This signaled an opportunity to generate returns by trading bitcoin. As bitcoin's price rose to tens of thousands of dollars, retail and average investors lost the opportunity to invest directly in bitcoin. Brokerages, responding to demand for investor access to bitcoin, began to design bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for approval started in 2013 with the Winklevoss brothers. The first official bitcoin-linked ETF was the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which mainly uses futures contracts. It was approved by the SEC in Oct. 2021 and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The Securities and Exchange Commission rejected proposals for bitcoin ETFs, which would consist of bitcoin held and securitized by a company until 2024. A court order in Aug. 2023 forced the SEC to reconsider these proposals, and on Jan. 10, 2024, the Commission approved 11 bitcoin spot ETFs. These spot ETFs, which hold bitcoin as opposed to futures like the Proshares ETF, began trading in Jan. 2024. Bitcoin futures ETFs are designed to allow more people to invest in bitcoin without the necessary expenses and hassles of buying them directly. They eliminate the need for security procedures and excessive funds while providing a familiar investment type. While you don't technically have cryptocurrency in your wallet, you have security keys that you need to safeguard if you own bitcoin. If you buy your cryptocurrency through an exchange, you can choose to have your keys stored on that exchange if it offers that service. However, wallets and exchanges can be hacked and keys stolen\u2014which means your cryptocurrency can be stolen. You can store your keys offline using several methods, but none of these methods are 100% secure or guaranteed. An ETF doesn't require you to own any cryptocurrency, store keys safely, or move the keys back and forth between different types of storage\u2014you own shares of the fund, which doesn't own any cryptocurrency either if it's a futures fund. You can store your keys in a \"hot wallet\" (connected to the Internet) or \"cold storage\" (an offline method). Each has its own benefits. One of the most significant obstacles for average investors is price. Bitcoin (BTC) set a record high of nearly $69,000 per BTC in 2021. Since late 2022, its price has hovered between $20,000 and $70,000. The high price means that retail investors may not have the assets to purchase one BTC. While you can buy smaller bitcoin denominations on cryptocurrency exchanges, an ETF allows you to gain exposure to BTC within your budget, risk tolerance, and investing goals on a fully regulated exchange using an approved instrument. Perhaps most importantly, ETFs are much better understood across the investment world than cryptocurrencies. So, if you're only interested in becoming involved in\u00a0digital currency\u00a0investing, an ETF lets you focus on trading an asset you already understand rather than learning about blockchain, mining, decentralized exchanges, distributed ledgers, key storage, and cryptocurrency. Though there are advantages to investing in future ETFs, there are also some downsides. These limitations are further amplified by the legal uncertainty and risk within the cryptocurrency industry. Several limitations to keep in mind are below. Tracking error refers to the discrepancy between the performance of the ETF and the actual price movement of the underlying bitcoin futures. This can happen for several reasons such as management fees, transaction costs, or logistic issues in replicating prices of a security. This means that the value of the ETF may, at times, not directly match the actual current exact value of bitcoin at any given moment. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Authorities worldwide consider and implement new regulations. Changes in regulations can impact the legality, trading, and valuation of bitcoin futures, introducing uncertainty for investors in bitcoin futures ETFs. The liquidity of the underlying bitcoin futures contracts is crucial for the ETF to operate smoothly. Limited liquidity in the futures market may result in wider bid-ask spreads, making it more expensive for investors to buy or sell shares of the ETF. Because bitcoin futures ETFs are relatively new (compared to more established equity ETFs), they may temporarily have higher liquidity risk as they ramp up with investments and share issuance. Bitcoin futures contracts have expiration dates. The ETF has to roll contracts before they expire. The process of rolling involves selling expiring contracts and buying new ones, incurring transaction costs. This strategy may slightly erode the fund's return, especially during periods of contango or backwardation. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, making them susceptible to cybersecurity risks. Hacks, fraud, and security breaches in cryptocurrency exchanges can impact bitcoin's value. Depending on where the future contracts reside, they may be susceptible to unique security challenges compared to other forms of electronic investments. For instance, it may or may not be possible for certain future contracts to be held in a cold wallet, thus limiting the amount of protection the digital contract may have. If you're looking to invest in bitcoin futures ETFs, you can purchase them through your broker or advisor if they offer them. Many bitcoin futures ETFs trade on exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange ARCA and Nasdaq: There are also bitcoin futures ETFs that let investors short the cryptocurrency, such as the ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF (BITI). It's important to note that these ETFs are not entirely comprised of bitcoin futures. They tend to vary between investing in traditional securities and holding bitcoin futures contracts when they meet the fund's strategy. For example, the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy Fund is designed to hold bitcoin futures contracts only when positions are profitable. Otherwise, it can hold securities of bitcoin-related companies and money market instruments. It can also borrow using reverse purchase agreements. There are several ETFs that hold bitcoin futures available on exchanges. Yes. You can trade bitcoin futures on many exchanges or purchase shares of a bitcoin futures ETF. It depends on the ETF, its investing strategy, and your sentiments, goals, and risk tolerances. There are several to choose from, so make sure you do your research and choose one that aligns with your strategy. Bitcoin futures ETFs are funds that bundle bitcoin futures contracts. They provide investors without the means or desire to invest directly in cryptocurrency a way to gain exposure to these volatile and sometimes lucrative assets. You can purchase them on official exchanges. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

            "title": "What Common ETFs Track the Banking Sector?",
            "content": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career. Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a marketable security that tracks indexes, index funds, commodities or bonds, for example. Like mutual funds, ETFs are designed to reduce the risk for shareholders through the use of diversification. Index mutual funds and most ETFs are passively managed, seeking to match the fund's performance to a specific market index before fees and expenses. However, in contrast to mutual funds, ETFs trade the same way as common stocks in stock exchanges. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs do not have the net asset value\u00a0(NAV) calculated at the end of each day, but ETFs are more transparent than mutual funds. Mutual funds typically disclose their holdings quarterly, while\u00a0ETFs do so daily. Some of the ETFs\u00a0that track the banking sector are financial ETFs with varying degrees of exposure to banks, while others are pure-play bank ETFs. A number of these\u00a0ETFs focus on the international financial services sector, while others concentrate on U.S. banking segments such as major banks, regional banks or community banks. Common ETFs in the global financial sector include KBW Bank ETF and iShares Global Financials ETF. As its name implies, KBW Bank ETF (KBWB) is a pure-play ETF for the banking industry. Before expenses, it attempts to closely match the returns and characteristics of the KBW Bank Index, an index of geographically diverse companies representing national money center banks and regional banking institutions. Specifically, iShares Global Financials (IXG) seeks to track the investment results of an index made up of diversified global equities in the financial sector. This fund offers exposure to companies providing financial services to both commercial and retail customers, including banks, investment funds, and insurance firms. Common ETFs for tracking U.S. financial services companies include iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF), Financial Select Sector SPDR, ProShares Ultra Financials (UYG), and Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH). Financial Select Sector SPDR\u00a0(XLF) is home to 72 stocks. Holdings include major U.S. money center banks such as Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America. For investors seeking to avoid investments in big banks, there are ETFs that specialize in U.S. regional or community banks. For example, the SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) follows the S&P Regional Banks Select Industry Index. The iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF\u00a0(IAT) tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Regional Banks Index, giving investors exposure to around 35 stocks. This fund is concentrated on some of the big names in the regional banking industry, such as U.S. Bancorp, PNC and Truist. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF\u00a0(KBE) is not a pure regional bank ETF, but the majority of its assets are regional banks, with smaller allocations to thrift and mortgage finance companies, diversified banks and other diversified financials. For its part, the First Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank Index (QABA) holds positions in about 139 small banks. Based on asset size, this ETF excludes the largest banks and thrifts. It also excludes companies with credit card or international specializations.

            "title": "How Do Cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) Work?",
            "content": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest. Cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) track the price performance of cryptocurrencies by investing in a portfolio linked to their instruments. Like other such funds, crypto ETFs trade on regular stock exchanges, and investors can hold them in their standard brokerage accounts. A growing roster of ETFs\u2014a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)\u2014in early 2024 began offering investors the chance to invest in bitcoin through their holdings. After about a decade of regulatory wrangling, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under pressure from a 2023 D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, authorized the first spot crypto ETFs in early 2024. These investments allow retail traders to gain direct exposure to crypto prices without owning the assets directly. This makes it possible to speculate on cryptocurrency prices without doing business on a crypto exchange or dealing with the costs and complexities of directly owning digital assets. However, crypto ETFs generally have higher fees than other ETFs, and while the funds themselves are regulated, there is no such oversight in the crypto markets where the funds are invested. For example, the SEC has argued that without proper oversight and surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets, it's difficult to prevent fraudulent activities and ensure fair trading practices in the crypto markets. Below, we take you through how these funds work, what worries the SEC still has around these products, what benefits they might have, and what this all means for everyday investors. While most ETFs replicate how indexes work by holding a basket of underlying assets, crypto ETFs have a couple of ways of tracking the performance of a digital currency. Spot ETFs directly hold the cryptocurrency, building a portfolio that replicates the performance of the digital assets it contains. Other crypto ETFs invest in futures contracts, which are agreements to buy or sell crypto at a preset date and price. Given their portfolios, these ETFs have share prices that mimic changes in the price of derivatives instead of the cryptocurrencies themselves. Therefore, the price of shares in a given cryptocurrency ETF rises and falls in line with crypto futures contract prices. Like other derivatives, synthetic cryptocurrency ETFs have an additional risk because of the lack of oversight and valuation concerns in the crypto exchanges from where the funds would be pulling crypto. While U.S. regulators refused to approve crypto ETFs for several years\u2014the SEC turned away some 20 proposals in spot ETFs from 2018 to 2023 alone\u2014they were readily available to investors in Europe and Canada. The SEC approved the first crypto futures ETFs for the U.S. market in October 2021 and the first spot crypto ETFs in January 2024. The first cryptocurrency ETF, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, started trading in October 2021. This is an ETF that tracks bitcoin futures prices. An analysis of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, the first crypto ETF on U.S. markets, shows how crypto futures ETFs work. The fund assigns about half of its portfolio to Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) bitcoin futures that expire at the end of the current month and another half to CME bitcoin futures expiring the following month. As the expiration of the contracts in the portfolio approaches, the fund rolls over its investments, selling the expiring contracts and buying contracts for the coming month. The costs associated with rolling over the contracts may account for some of the differences between the performance of the ETFs and their underlying cryptocurrencies. ProShares also has Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), an ether futures ETF like the one it provides for bitcoin. The fund tracks the price of ether with futures contracts. ProShares has ETFs that track a mix of bitcoin and ether using equal or market-cap weighting for investors looking for exposure to several crypto tokens. There are also inverse ETFs, such as the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF. This uses futures to generate the inverse of bitcoin's returns, allowing investors to profit on days when cryptocurrency prices decline. Investment funds can also directly trade and hold cryptocurrencies. Spot crypto ETFs are funds that buy cryptocurrencies and securitize them. Investors buy and sell shares as needed, just like a traditional ETF. In a spot crypto ETF, the fund can issue and redeem shares, offering retail and other investors a stake in the crypto market. Starting in 2014, asset managers sought approval from the SEC for spot bitcoin ETFs. Between October 2022 and October 2023, the SEC received more than 3,500 crypto-related fund applications. In January 2024, the SEC approved the first 11 spot bitcoin ETFs, opening the door to more spot cryptocurrency ETFs later. In January 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first 11 bitcoin spot ETFs for U.S. markets. On their first trading day, they had about $4.6 billion in trading volume. In May 2024, the SEC also started to pave the way for spot ether ETFs. The SEC approved a rule change that would allow for the listing and trading of eight spot ether ETFs. Prior to this approval, the SEC expressed concerns about Ethereum's staking feature and its previous worries with bitcoin for fraud, volatility, and low investor protections in crypto markets. \"Staking,\" which allows ether holders to earn income by locking up their tokens to help validate transactions on the network, is a crucial feature of Ethereum's consensus mechanism. This income-generating feature, which began on the ether platform in 2022, raises questions about how staking rewards should be taxed and reported. This gave the SEC another reason to be reluctant to approve spot ether ETFs, given the lack of regulatory clarity about their tax status. Note that the SEC's approval of a rule change for spot ether ETFs does not mean that these ETFs can start trading. Applications from the investment managers need to be reviewed and further approvals need to be given. Cryptocurrency ETFs are a developing asset class, and given the regulatory uncertainty, the market may look different in the future. Nevertheless, owning shares in cryptocurrency ETFs has some advantages when accessing the crypto markets. The most significant benefit of cryptocurrency ETFs is that they provide exposure to crypto without additional ownership expenses or exposure to the risk of owning and holding them in a crypto wallet. For example, there are custody charges for cryptocurrencies, and some secure digital wallets charge an annual fee. These charges can add up quickly. Cryptocurrencies also come with transaction and network fees, which the ETF providers take care of, even if you pay indirectly through the fund's expense ratio. Cryptocurrency jargon, derived mostly from its technological makeup, is still a roadblock to crypto adoption. Average investors often find it difficult to grasp the scope and roles of cryptocurrencies. Plus, these investors might be unfamiliar with networking technology, making crypto-speak, such as halving and blockchain, even more disinviting. Investing in a cryptocurrency ETF makes learning enough to get into crypto much more manageable. Cryptocurrency exchanges, storage devices, wallets, and some poorly designed blockchains have been hacked since they were launched, leading to constant worries in the crypto world about security. Cryptocurrency security can be a tall order for individual investors, who may not be familiar with the required methods. A cryptocurrency ETF takes care of this for you. There are more than 9,000 cryptocurrencies available in trading markets worldwide as of January 2024. The infrastructure to buy and sell them is becoming more sound, but it's still relatively untamed territory compared with securities exchanges. For example, some tokens are available on certain cryptocurrency exchanges while others are not, and exchanges can operate in some countries but not others. There are also extra costs that come with buying crypto. Cryptocurrency ETFs allow you to diversify your holdings without the fees and hassles of buying and exchanging the tokens yourself. The novelty of cryptocurrency ETFs is one of its drawbacks, not least since it's still unknown how regulations in this area will evolve. Given the likelihood that more crypto ETFs will emerge, it's important to be aware of their potential issues. Crypto ETFs do not always duplicate the price moves of the underlying digital token. This is especially true for ETFs that depend on futures contracts to track cryptocurrencies, which have to roll over their positions as contracts expire. While crypto ETFs help investors avoid some costs of directly owning digital currencies, they have their own fees. Since they are often actively managed, crypto ETFs can have higher expense ratios than other ETFs. For example, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF's expense ratio is 0.95%. For comparison, the expense ratio for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF is just 0.09%. Although cryptocurrency ETFs simplify some of what's involved in trading digital currencies, they are still subject to the dramatic price swings of the crypto markets. This means more risk for you, which can be even more worrying if you are more accustomed to the lower volatility of more typical ETFs. Investors in crypto ETFs are not the owners of the digital assets. While crypto ETFs do bring convenience, you won't have control or access to the cryptocurrency itself, and the decentralization and anonymity associated with crypto don't apply to ETF shareholders. Trade on stock exchanges using regular brokerage accounts Provide exposure to crypto without direct ownership Avoid crypto custody and trading expenses Reduce the learning curve Regulatory uncertainty Elevated fees and expenses Subject to volatility in crypto markets No direct ownership or control over underlying cryptocurrency. In addition to allocating funds to futures and spot ETFs, investors can put their money into several other ETF-like products for crypto exposure. Let's dig into these options. While the SEC has only reluctantly approved a handful of crypto ETFs, a similar product has already been available for years: bitcoin investment trusts. These are closed-end funds that resemble the spot crypto ETFs being proposed. They own bitcoins on behalf of investors, and their shares trade in over-the-counter (OTC) markets. But these are not ETFs. They are open only to investment firms, accredited investors, or high-net-worth individuals and are not accessible to the retail public. They tend to have a high minimum investment amount, and each purchase of shares is accompanied by a lockup period for investors. ETFs are one variety of exchange-traded products (ETP). Crypto ETPs, when discussed, refer, however, to those that specifically hold debt securities issued by special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that hold the underlying crypto assets. The SPV uses the crypto as collateral to issue the ETPs, which are traded on exchanges. Crypto ETPs fall under the Securities Act of 1933 and are less regulated than ETFs. Spot Crypto ETPs, in other words, are not investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of ETF shares. Another difference is that crypto ETFs can create and redeem shares based on market demand, helping the share price align with the fund's net asset value. Crypto ETPs typically have a fixed supply of shares that trade at market-based prices which can deviate from the underlying crypto value. Investing in companies that hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheet is another way to invest in crypto without owning the digital tokens. Some publicly listed companies hold a large number of bitcoins. For example, MicroStrategy (MSTR) owned about 214,000 bitcoins as of May 2024. Galaxy Digital Holdings (BRPHF) and Tesla (TSLA) are other publicly listed companies with bitcoins on their balance sheets. Plenty of ETFs offer diversified exposure to companies that engage with blockchain technology or crypto companies. For example, the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) holds a portfolio of companies that develop and use blockchain technologies. Crypto ETFs are designed to mimic the assets so investors can gain exposure to significant price fluctuations. However, because prices vary so much, there is more risk involved in crypto ETFs. If you're considering adding these to your portfolio, speaking with a financial advisor about your specific circumstances and goals is always the prudent choice. The tax implications for crypto ETFs often differ from directly holding cryptocurrency. In many jurisdictions, crypto ETF gains are treated like capital gains, which can be more favorable than the tax treatment for direct cryptocurrency transactions. Consulting a tax advisor about your specific circumstances is always prudent in cases like this. There are a few cryptocurrency index funds, such as the Bitwise 10 (BITW) or Galaxy Crypto Index Fund. These funds are only available to non-U.S. investors or in the U.S. to accredited investors. Yes, you can short a crypto ETF, as you can with any ETF. Shorting allows you to gain from the decline in an asset's price. This strategy, especially in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, involves elevated risks and potentially unlimited losses, so it's crucial to understand the dangers before going ahead. ETFs are a retail investor-friendly way to gain exposure to assets that might otherwise be too costly. Brokers want to offer ETFs that hold cryptocurrency so that average investors can participate in cryptocurrency investing. However, these funds tend to come with additional risks and expenses, so it is important to research them thoroughly before making an investment decision.

            "title": "How Do You Calculate the Excess Return of an ETF or Indexed Mutual Fund?",
            "content": "For exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the excess return should equal the risk-adjusted (or beta) measure that exceeds the instrument's benchmark or annual expense ratio. It's easy to assess index mutual funds against the benchmark index: just subtract the benchmark's total return from the fund's net asset value to find the excess return. Due to mutual fund expenses, the excess return for an index fund is typically negative. As a general rule, investors prefer index mutual funds and ETFs that outperform their benchmarks and have positive excess returns. Some investors and analysts believe it is almost impossible to generate excess returns over an extended time period for managed mutual funds due to the prevalence of high fees and market uncertainty. Similar to most index mutual funds, most ETFs underperform relative to their benchmark indexes. ETFs tend to have higher excess returns on average than index mutual funds. Think of the expected return for an ETF as the ETF's alpha for a given price and risk profile. Several different measures of risk can be used to pair up an ETF with a benchmark. One common example is to use the weighted average cost of equity (WACE). If you don't have or don't want to use the annual expense ratio or a simple benchmark when calculating an ETF's excess return, use total return in excess of the expected return based on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) formula. The CAPM formula can be written as follows: TEFTR\n\n\n=\n\n\nRFRR\n\n\n+\n\n\n(\n\n\nETFb\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n(\n\n\nMR\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nRFRR\n\n\n)\n\n\n)\n\n\n+\n\n\nER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEFTR\n\n\n=\n\n\nTotal\u00a0ETF\u00a0return\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRFRR\n\n\n=\n\n\nRisk-free\u00a0rate\u00a0of\u00a0return\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nETFb\n\n\n=\n\n\nETF\u00a0beta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMR\n\n\n=\n\n\nMarket\u00a0return\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nER\n\n\n=\n\n\nExcess\u00a0return\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{aligned} &\\text{TEFTR} = \\text{RFRR} + ( \\text{ETFb} \\times ( \\text{MR} - \\text{RFRR} ) ) + \\text{ER} \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{TEFTR} = \\text{Total ETF return} \\\\ &\\text{RFRR} = \\text{Risk-free rate of return} \\\\ &\\text{ETFb} = \\text{ETF beta} \\\\ &\\text{MR} = \\text{Market return} \\\\ &\\text{ER} = \\text{Excess return} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\n\n\n\u200bTEFTR=RFRR+(ETFb\u00d7(MR\u2212RFRR))+ERwhere:TEFTR=Total\u00a0ETF\u00a0returnRFRR=Risk-free\u00a0rate\u00a0of\u00a0returnETFb=ETF\u00a0betaMR=Market\u00a0returnER=Excess\u00a0return\u200b Rearranged, the formula looks like this: ER\n\n\n=\n\n\nRFRR\n\n\n+\n\n\n(\n\n\nETFb\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n(\n\n\nMR\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nRFRR\n\n\n)\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nTEFTR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{aligned} &\\text{ER} = \\text{RFRR} + ( \\text{ETFb} \\times ( \\text{MR} - \\text{RFRR} ) ) - \\text{TEFTR} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\n\n\n\u200bER=RFRR+(ETFb\u00d7(MR\u2212RFRR))\u2212TEFTR\u200b Using the CAPM method, you can compare two portfolios or ETFs with equal or highly similar risk profiles (beta) to see which produces the most excess returns. Index funds are\u00a0designed to avoid large positive or negative excess returns relative to their index. Index fund creators use risk-control techniques and passive management to minimize the expected deviation from the benchmark. Calculating the excess returns for an index fund is easy. To take a simple case, compare an S&P 500 index mutual fund's total returns to the S&P 500 performance. It is possible, though unlikely, for the indexed fund to outperform the S&P 500. In this case, the excess\u00a0returns will be positive. It is more likely that the administrative fees associated with mutual funds will produce a slightly negative excess\u00a0return."
